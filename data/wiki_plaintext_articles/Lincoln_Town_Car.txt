   The Lincoln Town Car is a full-size luxury sedan and serves as the
   flagship of Ford's Lincoln luxury car division. Often referred as a
   traditional American luxury sedan the Town Car features a V8 engine,
   rear wheel drive, very generous exterior and interior dimensions as
   well as a "Pillowy ride and chrome aplenty." (Forbes) The Town Car is
   currently the largest American-made car, measuring nearly 18 feet (5.49
   m) in length for a standard Town Car and 18 1/2 ft (5.64 m) for an L
   Edition. The Town Car's main competitors include the Lexus LS 460 and
   Cadillac DTS. Manufactured in the Wixom Assembly Plant, the Town Car
   is, despite recently declining sales numbers, one of the best selling
   American luxury cars. It also serves as America's most used limousine,
   especially as its main competitor, Cadillac is said not to be as
   dependable. While relatively affordable when compared to European
   flagship luxury sedans, the Town Car is currently the most expensive
   American luxury sedan (according to base MSRP) with prices ranging from
   US$42,875 for a basic Signature Series to $56,745 for a top-of-the-line
   Signature L Series.


   Lincoln Town Car

    Lincoln is the only domestic automaker offering big rear-drive luxury
   cars... the company has done well with its new Town Car. Whether you've
   got a 500-mile day ahead of you or it's your turn to take the foursome
                  to the course for 18 holes. -Edmunds.com


   Lincoln Town Car

   Ford at one time had considered ending production on Lincoln's flagship
   model after the planned closing of the Wixom Assembly Plant in Wixom,
   Michigan in 2007. Ford ultimately decided to keep the model and move
   assembly to the St. Thomas Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada where the
   Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis, which also use the Ford
   Panther platform are currently built. The Town Car's manufacture will
   resume at its new location in late 2007.

Name

   Third generation Town Car

   Third generation Town Car

   It is probably not a coincidence that "Town Car" is a translation of
   Cadillac's " Sedan de Ville," a model which was gaining popularity in
   the 1950s. Both names refer to a classic style of limousine, popular in
   the 1920s, which had an open chauffeur's compartment up front, but only
   Lincoln has sometimes attempted to make its modern models visually
   suggest their older namesakes. As an example, note the vinyl roof
   covering on the 1979 model shown below. It sweeps down the centre
   pillar as part of a raised molding, complete with opera lamps, which
   suggests a partition between front and rear seats, while no vinyl is
   applied to the front section of the roof over the driver.

History

   before downsizing in 1980.

   The Town Car name appeared on several trim levels on the Lincoln
   Continental flagship sedan in from 1959 to 1980. In 1981, the Lincoln
   Town Car became a model in its own right and became Lincoln's largest
   sedan as well as its flagship vehicle. Since then, there have been
   three generations of the Town Car with additional minor redesigns, one
   in 1995 and another one in 2003.

Pre-1981

   The Town Car name first appeared in the Lincoln line in 1959, on a
   special limousine-like version of the standard Continental. This first
   Town Car was available only in black and was identifiable by a unique
   padded vinyl top, which was a rarity at that time.

   After its first appearance in 1959, the Town Car name went dormant for
   10 years, and re-emerged as an especially plush interior option package
   for the 1969 Lincoln Continental.

   It next appeared as a trim option in 1971, and thereafter continued
   through 1980 as the top-line trim option package for the Lincoln
   Continental. Again, the Town Car trim featured an extra plush interior
   along with, usually but not always, a landau vinyl roof over the rear
   passenger compartment. The Town Car badge has always been applied to
   sedans, but from 1975 to 1980, there was a similar option for coupes
   called the Town Coupe.

First generation

     Wheelbase:   117.3 in (2979 mm)
      Length:     219.9 in (5585 mm)
       Width:     78.1 in (1984 mm)
      Height:     55.9 in (1420 mm)
    Curb weight:  4044 lb (1834 kg)
   Fuel economy:  17  mpg (US) (13.8  L/100 km)/city
                  25  mpg (9.4  L/100 km)/highway
   Fuel capacity: 18 US gal (68.1 L)

   Since 1981, the Town Car has been considered a model in its own right,
   replacing the Continental (whose name reappeared a year later on a
   smaller model). Upon its introduction, the Town Car immediately became
   Lincoln's flagship model, a purpose it continues to serve to this day.

   The first generation Town Car featured a body profile and grille
   similar to that of the late 1970s Lincoln Continental. The interior
   layout included new seats, dashboard and door panels. The exterior door
   panels and fenders were also completely new, while the taillights and
   trunk lid experienced a slight redesign. To keep up with current design
   trends, the previously covered headlights were now exposed and composed
   of two adjoining square units.

   The first generation Town Car also featured many advanced luxury
   options for its time. While leather trim was only available on the
   Cartier edition, all trim levels featured six-way power seats as well
   as an optional 12-speaker JBL audio system.

   Similar to the Continental Town Car package, a half-vinyl coach roof
   with frenched rear window was also a standard option on the Signature
   and Cartier models.

   It is important to note that although 1981 was the first year of the
   Town Car as a separate model, it was in 1980 that the Panther platform
   Town Car was introduced under the previous model name "Continental Town
   Car". The introduction of the Panther platform Town Car in 1980 was
   also the end for 400 in³ and 460 in³ V8 engines in Lincoln's line-up;
   they were replaced with the very popular 302 in³ (5.0 L) V8. The
   transmission also changed to a 4-speed automatic with overdrive.

1985

   For 1985, the Town Car received minor design updates. Like previous
   years, the design scheme introduced for 1985 included a reflector
   running in between both taillights underneath the license plate frame,
   a design feature kept for the second generation Town Car. 1985 also saw
   the introduction of newer more ergonomically designed seats, featuring
   enhanced lumbar support.

Second generation

   Second generation
   1995 Lincoln Town Car with recently made changes to the design--a
   smaller headlight cluster with a body-colored strip visible between it
   and the grille, a more rounded, "organic" style dashboard, and new rear
   light bar incorporating a single center backup light and three new
   running lights on each end.
   Production: 1990–1997
   Engine: 4.6 L V8 (1991-1997)
   5.0 L V8 (1990)
   Transmission: 4-speed automatic
   Wheelbase: 117.4 in (2982 mm)
   Length: 220.2 in (5593 mm) (1990-1991)
   218.9 in (5560 mm) (1991-1997)
   Width: 76.2 in (1935 mm)
   Height: 56.9 in (1444 mm)
   Curb weight: 4040 lb (1818 kg)
   Fuel economy: 17  mpg (US) (13.8  L/100 km)/city
   25  mpg (9.4  L/100 km)/highway
   Fuel capacity: 18 US gal (68.1 L) (1990-1991)
   20 US gal (75.7 L) (1992-1997)

1990

   A 1990 to 1994 second generation Town Car, before the facelift.

   Another 1990-1994 Town Car with larger pre-facelift reflector
   headlights.

   In 1990, the Town Car's body went through a major redesign and a rear
   air suspension was added as standard equipment. That year, it was also
   named as Motor Trend's Car of the Year. Through most of this model run,
   the car was available in four trim levels: Town Car (Pre-cursor to the
   Executive Series ending in 1990), Executive (beginning with the 1991
   model year), Signature, and Cartier, in increasing order of price and
   appointment of features.

   The 1990 Lincoln Town Car also marked the end of the Town Car's
   1970s-based angular design. The wedges on the side of the hood which
   contained the parking and signal lights were removed and the
   Rolls-Royce-like grille was replaced with a more modern and more
   aerodynamic front fascia. Parking lights were now located adjoining to
   the grille and the headlights wrapped around the corners of the front.
   The door panels and fenders were replaced as well, while the trunk lid
   and taillights remained somewhat more similar to the 1980s model. The
   revised interior featured a new dashboard, seats, and interior door
   panels.

   Introduced in 1990 were several new options that had never been
   available before on a Town Car. Memory seating with power front
   passenger and driver lumbar and recliner support was an option on
   Signature Town Car and standard on Cartier Town Car. The
   Electrochromatic Dimming Mirror was also a carryover option from the
   1989 Town Car. Also being introduced as standard equipment for all Town
   Cars during the 1990 model year was a new digital instrumentation
   system with a more advanced message centre that gave the following:
   Distance to Empty, Fuel (Gallons) Remaining, Outside Temperature,
   Average Fuel Economy, Instant Fuel Economy, and two trip odometers. The
   digital instrumentation would not be standard on 1991 or 1992 Executive
   Series models, but would become standard again for the 1993 Executive
   model and remain standard on all models through 1997.

   1991 saw the introduction of Ford's new Modular V8, an SOHC design
   replacing the Ford 302 Windsor. Also standard in 1991 were dual front
   driver and passenger airbags.

   Overall the second generation Town Car was an overwhelming sales
   success and quickly became one of America's best selling full-size
   luxury sedans. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Town Car sales
   regularly exceeded 100,000 units with 120,121 Town Cars being sold in
   1994 alone.

1995

   Facelifted Lincoln Town Car with visible changes to the front fascia
   for 1995.

   The Town Car underwent a minor exterior facelift for the 1995 model
   year. Changes to the exterior included smaller, clear headlights as
   well as additional running lights in the rear.

   The interior was completely revamped. The Town Car received a new
   dashboard, new seats and new interior door panels. The angular interior
   shapes from the 1990 to 1994 model's interior were replaced by more
   modern-looking curved design elements. Many of the new interior
   components, such as the dashboard, featured a so-called "organic"
   design. 1995 also saw the introduction of a new steering wheel, which
   was used in all Panther-based sedans until 2004.

   Also introduced in 1995 was a new digital dash layout that featured a
   more italisized look to the readouts and a new feature called "Average
   Speed." This feature, on all digital instrument panels until the 2005
   overhaul, calculated the average travel speed over a period of time.
   Every other function remained the same from the 1990 overhaul of the
   digital dash. Memory seats with power lumbar support also became
   standard on Signarture Series sedans during this time as well.

Special Editions

   1992 and 1993 saw a special Signature Series sedan come to market: the
   Jack Nicklaus Signature Series, which featured a green body with a
   white vinyl top with white leather interior trimmed in green. Most of
   these editions have ornaments and wording on the exterior trimmed in
   gold . Options included on the 1992 and 1993 Jack Nicklaus Signature
   Series included: Memory Seats with Power Lumbar/Recliner, Leather
   Seats, and Monotone Paint.

   1995 also featured another special Signature Series edition called the
   Spinnaker Edition which featured tri-coat paint, the Spinnaker logo on
   the floor mats, and 16-inch spoked aluminium wheels.

   To celebrate Lincoln's 75th anniversary in 1996, the Town Car took on a
   "Diamond Anniversary" edition. This edition was applied to Signature
   Series sedans only. Options included a paint strip down the side,
   leather seats, wood instrument panel trim, window badging, cellular
   telephone, power moonroof, JBL audio system, auto electrochromatic
   dimming mirror w/compass, and traction assist.

   Also introduced in 1996 were the Ride Control and Touring Edition
   packages. Ride Control was only available on Signature and Cartier Town
   Cars while Touring Edition was available for all Town Car models. Ride
   control featured an auziliary power steering fluid cooler, 16-inch
   aluminium wheels, 225/60/16 tires, 3.27 axle ratio, 28.5 mm stabilizer
   bar, and revised air springs and shocks. Touring Edition featured a
   power moonroof, JBL audio system, auto dimming headlights, auto
   electrochromatic dimming mirror, auxiliary power steering fluid cooler,
   16-inch aluminium wheels, 225/60/16 tires, 3.27 axle ratio, 28.5 mm
   stabilizer bar, and revised air springs and shocks. Both the Ride
   Control and Touring Edition packages would last only between 1996 and
   1997; however, the Touring Edition package would make a brief comeback
   during the 2000 model year

Third generation

   Production: 1998–present
   Engine: 4.6 L: V8
   Transmission: 4-speed automatic
   Wheelbase: 117.7 in (2942 mm)
   123.7 in (3092 mm)
   Length: 215.3 in (5469 mm)

   25  mpg (9.4  L/100 km)/highway
   Fuel capacity: 19 US gal (71.9 L)

   The 1990 body style remained primarily unchanged until the next new
   body style premiered in 1998, a redesign which included the removal of
   the car's hood ornament and more angular shapes. The Cartier model also
   received a 220 hp version of the Modular V8.

   trim

   The more boxy Town Car design of the 1990s was replaced by a curvacious
   design scheme with a downwards sloping trunklid, pursed lip grille and
   cat-eye headlights.

   While the Town Car lost three inches in overall length, the new Town
   Car was two inches wider, one inch taller, and weighed 600 pounds more.
   The post-1997 Town Car features a slightly longer wheelbase as well.

   The interior was also completely redesigned. Door and instrument panels
   as well as the radio face, switches and controls were redone.
   Additional wood trim was added to the newly designed dahsboard and the
   door panels. The power seat controls were moved to the door panels.
   Lincoln emblems were also added to the door panels.

   A factory option available to individual owners of Town Cars since 2001
   has been a version of the Town Car with an extra six inches of rear
   seat legroom, designated as the "L" or "long" version. This model
   provides extra amenities for rear-seat passengers, including a unique
   rear-seat switch that allows the front-passenger seat to be moved
   forward as desired for extra room in the rear.

   A Touring Edition also became available in late 2000. The Touring
   Edition featured a more powerful 235 hp version of the Town Car's
   Modular V8 engine, dual exhaust pipes and unique 16 inch alloy wheels
   with larger tires.

2003

   2003 Lincoln Town Car with minor changes to the front fascia including
   a new grille and HID headlights. Also visible in the picture is the
   return of the hood ornament as well as one of the new 17 inch wheel
   choices.

   return of the hood ornament as well as one of the new 17 inch wheel
   choices.

   A minor body redesign in 2003 added the hood ornament back again. 2003
   also marked the last year that the Town Car was available in a trim
   package with the name "Cartier" (1981 to 2003). Beginning with the 2004
   model year, the top-of-the-line Town Car was instead designated as the
   "Ultimate". The Touring edition (on the Signature model only) was
   dropped likely because the handling of 2003 Town Cars were far better
   than last year's Touring edition. The 4.6 L V8 with 239 hp was also
   introduced for the 2003 model year.

   The interior remained largely unchanged for 2003. More brushed satin
   metals and an analog clock were added to the interior. The Lincoln
   emblems on the door panels were removed and the radio face including
   climate controls received a facelift.

   For the 2005 model year, the Ultimate trim level was dropped. The trim
   levels for the 2005 Lincoln Town Car were: Signature, Signature
   Limited, and the Signature L with a lengthened wheel-base.

   For 2006, the model trim levels were changed again. The trim levels for
   the 2006 Town Car are: Signature, Signature Limited, Designer, and
   Signature L.

   The Town Car overwhelmingly dominates the limousine market in the
   United States, since it is the only American luxury car still in
   production with body on frame construction, making the production of
   stretched versions easier than with unibody construction.

   In 1981 the Town Car was introduced in three trim levels, the base
   Executive Series, the mid-range Signature Series, and the
   top-of-the-line Cartier. The trim levels remained unchaged until 2003,
   when the Executive Series and Cartier names were dropped. The Signature
   Series did not any longer represent the mid-range model, rather it
   replaced the Executive Series with Ultimate designation being used for
   the mid-range and top model, which was formerly called the Cartier. In
   2005, however, the lineup was changed again. For 2005 only, the
   Ultimate designation was dropped, with only the Signature Series
   designation being used for all three trim levels. In 2006, Lincoln
   introduced the Designer Series as an additional trim-level to fit in
   between the mid-range Signature Limited Series and the top Singature L
   Series.

   Executive (1981 - 2003)
   The Executive Series was the basic trim levels and thus also most
   affordable trim level on the Lincoln Town Car from 1981 through 2003.
   The Executive Series designation is still used today, but only on fleet
   vehicles.

   Signature (1981 - present)
   The Signature Series was the mid-level trim and was also the most
   popular trim level from 1981 through 2003. In 2004 the trim levels were
   renamed, and the Signature Series was now used to describe the basic
   trim level and Ultimate was now used to describe the mid-level trim. In
   2005 the Ultimate was dropped and all trim levels were changed to a
   version of Signature. The basic trim level for 2005 was called
   Signature, the mid trim level was called Signature Limited and the
   top-of-line trim-level was called Signature L. The trim level
   designations were revised again for the 2006 model year. For 2006 a
   trim level called the Designer Series was added between the Signature
   Limited and top-of-line Signature L.

   Cartier (1981 - 2003)
   Cartier was used on the top-of-line Town Car from 1981 through 2003.
   The Cartier also featured its own version of Lincoln emblem which was
   stitched onto the seats. Golden Lincoln emblems on the tail-lights also
   became a staplemark on the Cartier Edition on 1998 through 2002 models.

   Ultimate (2004 only)
   Ultimate was only used on the 2004 Town Car. Ultimate designation was
   the mid-level trim, while Ultimate L was the designation used for the
   top-of-line Lincoln.

   L Edition (2001 - present)
   The designation "L" was used on Lincoln Town Cars with extended
   wheelbases. The L editions offer an additional six inches of legroom as
   well as separate audio and climate controls for rear passengers. While
   this desgination is similar to that used on other luxury flagship
   sedans such as the BMW 7-Series or the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, the "L"
   designation was never its own trim option on the Town Car. Instead the
   L edition was applied to the top-of-line Cartier (2003), Ultimate (2004
   only), and Signature (2005 - present) Series trim levels.

   Designer (2006 - present)
   The Designer Series is an upper-middle trim level in between the
   mid-level Signature Limited and top-of-the-line Signature L. The
   Designer Series is roughly $1,000 more expensive than the mid-level
   Signature Limited with a starting MSRP of $45,915.

Awards

   Over its twenty-five year run, the Town Car has become one of best
   selling luxury cars of the United States and received several awards in
   the process.
     * Highest Customer Satisfaction. According to J.D. Power and
       Associates the Lincoln marque has the highest customer satisfaction
       of any car brand. "Lincoln outperforms other brands in the areas of
       service initiation and user-friendly service. Lincoln customers are
       particularly pleased with the dealership’s ability to get them in
       for an appointment within a reasonable amount of time and the
       fairness of charges. Lincoln is the first domestic make to rank
       highest in CSI for two consecutive years." - JD Power Associates
       2005. Lincoln is followed by Cadillac, which ranked second, and
       Lexus which ranked fourth in the study.
     * Highest Customer Loyalty. Over two-thirds of Town Car buyers are
       repeat buyers with 60% not even considering the purchase of another
       luxury vehicle besides the Town Car.
     * Roominess. According to Forbes, Edmunds.com and NCTD, the Town Car
       is the most spacious luxury sedan under $200k; an honour easily
       proven by the interior's generous dimensions. A standard wheel-base
       Town Car features 112.7 ft³ of interior volume versus 105 ft³ in
       the Mercedes-Benz S 600 or 111 ft³ in the extended wheelbase BMW
       760il. The difference is even greater when comparing the Signature
       L Series with its enormous 120.5 ft³ of interior space.
     * One of the best chauffeured cars. Forbes magazine repeatedly named
       the Town Car one of the best cars to be chauffeured in, ahead of
       other, often more expensive flagship sedans, such as the
       Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7-Series and Lexus LS. The Town Car
       Signature L features a rear seat comfort package which not only
       provides rear seat passengers with audio system and rear
       compartment climate controls, but also features a control function
       which allows for the rear seat occupants to move the passenger seat
       forward, a feature exclusive to few ultra-luxury sedans. In
       addition to its many amenities, the Signature L also features an
       unrivaled 46.9 in of rear legroom, and 60 in of rear shoulder room.
     * Highest Possible Safety Rating. The Town Car has repeatedly earned
       the government's highest five star safety rating, a rating that
       shouldn't come as surprise considering the vehicle's overall
       length, width, and large overhangs. "Five stars in five categories.
       Town Car is the first car in automotive history to receive a
       five-star rating in all five categories" - Lincoln web-site. The
       Town Car is also the only vehicles to receive a five star rating in
       all five categories for five years in a row, from 2001 to 2006.
