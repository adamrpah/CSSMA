   Woodpeckers are near passerine birds of the order Piciformes. They are
   found worldwide and include about 180 species (including the famous
   ivory-billed).

   Some woodpeckers and wrynecks in the order Piciformes have zygodactyl
   feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. These feet,
   though adapted for clinging to a vertical surface, can be used for
   grasping or perching. Several species have only three toes. The
   woodpecker's long tongue, in many cases as long as the woodpecker
   itself ,can be darted forward to capture insects. The tounge is not
   attached to the woodpecker's head as in most birds, but instead it
   curls back up around its skull, which allows it to be so long.

   Woodpeckers gained their English name because of the habit of some
   species of tapping and pecking noisily on tree trunks with their beaks.
   This is both a means of communication to signal possession of territory
   to their rivals, and a method of locating and accessing insect larvae
   found under the bark or in long winding tunnels in the tree.

   The woodpecker first locates a tunnel by tapping on the trunk. Once a
   tunnel is found, the woodpecker chisels out wood till it makes an
   opening into the tunnel. Then it worms its tongue into the tunnel to
   try to locate the grub. The tongue of the woodpecker is long and ends
   in a barb. With its tongue the woodpecker skewers the grub and draws it
   out of the trunk.

   Woodpeckers also use their beaks to create larger holes for their nests
   which are 15-45 cm (6-18 inches) below the opening. These nests are
   lined only with wood chips and hold 2-8 white eggs laid by the females.
   Because the nests are out of sight, they are not visible to predators
   and eggs do not need to be camouflaged. Cavities created by woodpeckers
   are also reused as nests by other birds, such as some ducks and owls,
   and mammals, such as tree squirrels.

Trivia

   In February 2005 the Canadian scientist Dr Louis Lefebvre announced a
   method of measuring avian IQ in terms of their innovation in feeding
   habits. Woodpeckers were named among the most intelligent birds based
   on this scale.

   Woodpeckers inspired Walter Lantz to create the cartoon character Woody
   Woodpecker.

   The term " Peckerwood", an inversion of "Woodpecker", is used as a
   pejorative term in the United States. This word was coined in the 19th
   century by southern blacks to describe poor whites. They considered
   them loud and troublesome like the bird, and often with red hair like
   the woodpecker's head plumes. This word is still widely used by
   southern blacks to refer to southern whites.

Systematics

   The systematics of woodpeckers is quite convoluted. Based on an
   assumption of unrealistically low convergence in details of plumage and
   behaviour, 5 subfamilies were distinguished. However, it has turned out
   that similar plumage patterns and modes of life are not reliable to
   determine higher phylogenetic relationships in woodpeckers, and thus
   only 3 subfamilies should be accepted.

   For example, the genera Dryocopus ( Eurasia and Americas) and
   Campephilus (Americas) of large woodpeckers were believed to form a
   distinct group. However, they are quite unrelated and instead close to
   a Southeast Asian genus, Mulleripicus and Chrysocolaptes, respectively.
   In addition, the genus allocation of many species, e.g. the Rufous
   Woodpecker, has turned out to be in error, and some taxa with unclear
   relationships could be placed into the phylogeny (Benz et al., 2006;
   Moore et al., 2006).
