   The history of merit badges in the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) has been
   tracked by categorizing them into a series of merit badge types. In
   addition to the Boy Scouts of America, many other Scouting and
   Scouting-like organizations around the world, such as Pathfinders,
   Baden-Powell Scouts and Royal Rangers, issue merit badges or their
   equivalent; though they are sometimes called honours or proficiency
   badges. Other organizations, such as fire brigades, issue badges or
   awards that they refer to as merit badges, but that are in some
   respects different from the badges awarded by the BSA.

   Merit badges have been an integral part of the Scouting program since
   the start of the movement in the United Kingdom on August 1, 1907.
   Scouting came to the United States in 1910; the BSA quickly issued an
   initial list of just 14 merit badges, but did not produce or award
   them. In 1911, the BSA manufactured the first official 57 merit badges
   and began awarding them. The number of badges available has been as
   high as 140 and, as of 2006, is 121. Merit badge types are identifiable
   by the cloth and manufacturing process used to make them. The
   classification of badges into types came about as a way for collectors
   to categorize and classify their collections. Merit badge collectors
   often collect other Scouting memorabilia as well.

Purpose of merit badges

   Merit badges exist to encourage Scouts to explore areas that interest
   them and to teach them valuable skills in Scoutcraft. The award of
   merit badges sometimes leads to careers and lifelong hobbies. Scouts
   earn a merit badge by satisfying specified criteria; a Court of Honour
   is then held to present the badge. Scouts can earn badges at any point
   in their Scouting career, although this was not always the case — in
   the 1960s, Scouts first had to earn the rank of Second Class Scout
   before being allowed to work on and earn badges. The higher ranks of
   Star, Life Scout and Eagle require merit badges be earned. Certain
   badges are mandatory to receive these higher ranks. For a few years
   during the 1980s and 90s, " First Aid" merit badge was a requirement
   for the First Class Scout rank. Other mandatory badges include
   "Citizenship in the Community" and "Environmental Science" (see full
   list). The number of merit badges required for each of these higher
   ranks has varied historically, as has the ratio of mandatory merit
   badges and non-mandatory badges for those ranks. As of 2005, Scouts
   must earn a total of 21 merit badges for the Eagle Scout rank, 12 of
   which must be from the mandatory list. Once Scouts attain the Eagle
   rank, they can earn Eagle Palms, a core requirement of which is earning
   more merit badges.

Badge history

   The BSA changes the design, name, and availability of merit badges
   depending on various factors such as their popularity, shifts in the
   focus of the Scouting program, and changes in society. Of the original
   57 merit badges from 1911, only 11 are still available that also still
   have the same basic design motif (Architecture, Art, Athletics,
   Chemistry, First Aid, Lifesaving, Music, Plumbing, Public Health,
   Scholarship, and Surveying). Of those 11, only five were made available
   in each "generation" of the 10 merit badge types (these are
   Architecture, Art, Chemistry, Plumbing, and Public Health). The
   remaining six were not reproduced in a short lived "generation" of
   merit badges, Type I.

   Examples of merit badge change due to the degree of popularity/interest
   in a subject include " Interpreting", which only existed from
   1911-1952, when it was dropped; and "Genealogy" which was added in 1972
   when great interest in that subject arose.

   A good example of merit badges reflecting changes in the focus of the
   Scouting program is " Civics", which was originally the only
   citizenship-related merit badge. In 1952, the BSA placed more emphasis
   on this area by splitting "Civics" into four separate badges, which
   were in turn modified several times. Since 1991, the badges in this
   group are "Citizenship in the Community", "Citizenship in the Nation",
   "Citizenship in the World", and "Family Life", all of which are
   currently on the mandatory list for Eagle Scout.

   The "First Aid to Animals" and "Plant Science" merit badges have both
   evolved due to societal changes. "First Aid to Animals" was one of the
   original merit badges in 1911 but was dropped because of its
   agricultural focus in 1972. It was resurrected as "Veterinary Science"
   in 1973 with a focus on small pet-type animals vs. farm animals. It was
   renamed " Veterinary Medicine" in 1995. Merging of merit badges can be
   seen in "Plant Science", into which all crop growing merit badges were
   merged in 1972 because America had changed from an agrarian society
   into and an urban/ suburban society since the founding of the BSA.

   Sometimes the design of or requirements for a merit badge seem to
   change for no apparent reason. An example of this is "Personal Health",
   which was an original 1911 merit badge with a heart motif. In 1952 it
   became "Personal Fitness". In 1969 it was redesigned, displaying a
   youth in gym gear doing what looks like a jumping jack exercise.
   Currently, the BSA is "field testing" a Hunting merit badge, but it has
   not yet been released on a national basis.

   The merit badges on the mandatory list for Eagle rank have changed
   several times; however, "First Aid" is the only merit badge that has
   always been on the mandatory list for Eagle. In 1969, the BSA began
   manufacturing those merit badges that are required in order to obtain
   the rank of Eagle Scout with a silver border vice the green border.

Types of merit badges

   As of 2005 and as described in Merit Badge Field Guide, there are 10
   major types of merit badges: Types A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.

Type A

   Front/Reverse (Gardening) Essential facts Description
   Gardening, Type A, front
   Gardening, Type A, back Nickname: square

   Years of Issue:
   1911–1933
   Background Type A merit badges were manufactured in rolls and then cut
   into squares approximately 2" (5 cm) square, hence its nickname square.
   Front The early "Gardening" badge shown here is often confused with
   "Corn Farming", which had three corn husks. Creases were created when
   these square badges were folded under by hand before being sewn onto a
   merit badge sash, which is worn over the right shoulder. Type A badges
   came from the manufacturer without the crease. Some people removed
   excess cloth before creasing them to make the merit badge round on the
   merit badge sash. These cut–down squares look similar to a Type C, but
   usually end up with straighter, yet uneven edges; whereas unaltered
   Type B, C, D, and E badges have a smooth circular edge. Also, Type A
   merit badges usually have lighter tan khaki cloth than a Type C badge.
   Reverse Some Type A, B, and C badges bear black watermarks or partial
   watermarks of the BSA emblem on the back as these were printed on the
   back of the rolls at certain intervals

Type B

   Front/Reverse (Public Health) Essential facts Description
   Nickname: wide border

   Years of Issue:
   1934–1935

   Unusually large size
   Background Some Type B and C badges retained the same cloth colour as
   Type A, but most came in a darker tan/brown cloth.
   Front Type B merit badges were the first badges to be manufactured with
   a smooth, round shape, which the manufacturer produced by folding the
   badge's edge under the back and crimping it. Type C, D, and E badges
   were also manufactured in this manner, hence Types B–E are referred to
   as crimped. Type B badges have a diameter of 1 3/4" (44 mm) after
   crimping. Type B has a margin of 3/16" to 1/4" (5–6 mm) between the
   edge of the badge and the embroidered green ring; because this margin
   is wider than in the Type C badge, Type B is nicknamed wide border.
   Reverse As with Type A, some Type B badges bear watermarks on the back.

Type C

   Front/Reverse (Civics) Essential facts Description
   Civics, Type C, front
   Civics, Type C, back Nickname: narrow border, narrow tan

   Years of Issue:
   1936–1946
   Background Type C merit badges were made from the same type of cloth as
   Type B badges, but were a little smaller in width.
   Front The diameter of a Type C badge from outer edge to outer edge is
   about 1 1/2" (38 mm), with the distance from the crimp to the outer
   edge of the green ring being 1/8" (3 mm). Size is the only difference
   in a Types B and C; hence the nicknames narrow border and narrow tan.
   In fact, all Type C, D and E badges are the same size. Compare Types B
   and C side-by-side; the difference in the distance from the outer crimp
   edges to the green rings is obvious. Beginning with Type C, all merit
   badges have been made with a diameter of 1 1/2" (38 mm), except for a
   few Type I designs (see below). Most Type C badges were not made after
   1942 (see Type D section below); only the Air Scout aviation blues,
   which came in four designs, were made in Type C from 1942–46. These had
   the standard Type C cloth, but were fully embroidered with blue
   backgrounds inside a blue ring. This is the only time badges were made
   with blue rings.
   Reverse As with Type A, some Type C badges bear watermarks on the back.
   Type C, D, and E merit badges all have sizing on the back, which serves
   as a stiffener to help the badge retain its crimp.

Type D

   Front/Reverse (Camping) Essential facts Description
   Camping, Type D, front
   Camping, Type D, back Nickname: fine twill, sand twill

   Years of Issue:
   1942–1946
   Background Type D merit badges were made from a lighter weight cloth
   with a much finer weave and lighter tan colour than Type C badges
   because the heavier, thicker weave material that Type C badges were
   made from was needed to make uniforms needed during World War II. This
   is the only difference in a Type C and Type D.
   Front Because of its finer weave twill material, Type D badges are
   called fine twill. Another name for them is sand twill because of their
   sandy colour. The only Type C badges made during this era were the
   afore–mentioned Type C aviation–blues. Because sand twills were made
   for such a short time many decades ago; they are rather rare.
   Reverse As with Type C, Type D badges have sizing on the back.

Type E

   Front/Reverse (Dog Care) Essential facts Description
   Dog Care, Type E, front
   Dog Care, back Nickname: khaki green, khaki

   Years of Issue:
   1947–1960

   Last type with crimped edges
   Background Type E merit badges were made from the same material as Type
   C badges, but the colour is a decidedly darker green, hence the
   nickname khaki green. This is the only difference in a Type C and Type
   E.
   Front Serious collectors have Type B, C, D, and E merit badges
   recrimped to restore their original appearance as many badges lose
   their neat appearance over the years if the merit badge is not cared
   for properly. If a Type E badge has had significant washings or sun
   exposure it can be hard to tell from a Type C.
   Reverse As with Type C, Type E badges have sizing on the back.

Type F

   Front/Reverse (Swimming) Essential facts Description
   Swimming, Type F, front
   Swimming, Type E, back Nickname: khaki twill, rolled edge twill

   Years of Issue:
   1961–1968

   Not all badges appeared in this type
   Background Type F badges replaced the earlier crimped edge badges with
   a "rolled" edge, which is stitched around the outside to prevent
   unraveling.
   Front Type F was introduced concurrently with Type G (see below), and
   both types were manufactured together for several years. The difference
   in the motif is that whereas Type F badges had a plain background, Type
   G badges were completely embroidered inside the green ring. Some badge
   motifs had been made this way since Type A; they moved directly to Type
   G and never appeared in Type F.
   Reverse The BSA introduced an extra layer of cloth backing underneath
   the khaki cloth. Type F used gauze or cheese cloth and subsequent badge
   types used a fuller solid cloth backing.

Type G

   Front/Reverse (Forage Crops) Essential facts Description
   Forage Crops, Type G, front
   Forage Crops, Type G, back Nickname: cloth back

   Years of Issue:
   1961–1971
   Background While all Type G badges have full embroidery inside the
   green ring, there were a few Type A, B, C, D, and E merit badges with
   full embroidery and hence do not exist as Type F merit badges; examples
   are: " Foundry Practice", "Grasses, Legumes, and Forage Crops" (later
   shortened to "Forage Crops"), "Farm Layout and Building Arrangement",
   and "Farm Home and its Planning".
   Front In 1969, the BSA started issuing silver-bordered badges for those
   badges that were on the mandatory list for Eagle rank. Silver–bordered
   badges appear in Type G, H, and J. Consequently, the border colour of a
   badge will change when it goes on and off the mandatory list. A good
   example is "Camping" Type H, which had a green border from 1973–1977,
   yet silver border before and after that; so this particular green
   border "Camping" variety is fairly rare.
   Reverse Type G badges were the first to appear with a full cloth
   backing hence the nickname cloth back.

Type H

   Front/Reverse (Collections) Essential facts Description
   Collections, Type H, front
   Collections, Type H, back Nickname: plastic back

   Years of Issue:
   1972–2002
   Background Type H merit badges were the first badges made with a
   plastic–coated backing, hence the nickname plastic back. The plastic
   coating is most commonly clear, but is also found in a milky white
   colour and from 1972 until about 1977 blue plastic–coated merit badges
   were often issued. The blue–coated badges are fairly rare since they
   were only made for a few years. On merit badges that have a blue
   embroidered background, it is extremely difficult to tell if the
   plastic coating is blue or clear.
   Front Type G, H, I and J badges are all fully embroidered. As they were
   made for 30 years, Type H merit badges are by far the most common.
   Reverse Type H and all subsequent badges have both the full cloth back
   of a Type G and a plastic coated backing as a stiffener.

Type I

   Front/Reverse (White Water) Essential facts Description
   White Water, Type I, front
   White Water, Type I, back Nickname: computer design

   Years of Issue:
   1993–1995
   Background Type I merit badges were designed using computers, hence the
   nickname computer design. The background stitching is flatter from that
   of Type G, H, and J badges and has the appearance of having punched
   holes, but the most obvious difference is in the green border––it is no
   longer rolled, but flat.
   Front The BSA decided to phase in these badges beginning in 1993, but
   they were not very popular and were discontinued in 1995. Consequently,
   the BSA reverted to the Type H design for an additional seven years.
   Since Type I was never fully adopted, not all merit badges appear in
   Type I. In fact, only 30 varieties appear as Type I. So while not that
   old, they are also not that common. Another oddity is that some Type I
   badges were made in two sizes: 38 mm and 42 mm. Two different sizes of
   merit badges can not be lined up neatly on the same sash. Some merit
   badges that did appear as Type I only appear in 38 mm, some as only 42
   mm, and some appeared in both sizes. None of the merit badges on the
   mandatory list for Eagle rank appeared as Type I.
   Reverse There is a lockstitch and a brown ring stitched just inside the
   green ring on the obverse side of a Type I badge.

Type J

   Front/Reverse (Fish and Wildlife Management) Essential facts
   Description
   Fish & Wildlife Management, Type J, front
   Fish & Wildlife Management, Type J, back Nickname: Scout Stuff

   Years of Issue:
   2002–present
   Background The BSA started putting its supply division logo on all
   patches (ranks, position, numerals, etc) in 2002 to reduce
   counterfeiting and show support for the American labor force.
   Front The front of a Type J looks just like the front of Type H badges.
   Reverse The only difference in a Type J merit badge and a Type H badge
   is that a Type J has some variation of the BSA Supply Division's Scout
   Stuff logo stamped on the back; hence the nickname "Scout Stuff". In
   the first few years the logo stamped on the back was not consistent in
   design. One of the early stamps was just a blue rectangle with the word
   Scout and a circular blue design inside it. The "Scout Stuff" design
   shown in the sample photo is now the standard. On a good specimen, a
   label reading BSA Supply Division and Scout Stuff is legible.

Errors vs variations

   The visual appearance of a merit badge may alter due to several
   reasons. A "variation" is a minor change, whether intentional or not. A
   "manufacturing error" is a mistake or significant deviation from the
   BSA-approved badge design during production. A "design error" is when a
   badge is manufactured the way it was designed, but the design had a
   significant flaw.

Specimen variations

   Variations do not appreciably alter the badge's appearance or design.
   Two types of variations include positional changes and stitching
   changes. These are often caused by manufacturing variations and not
   classified separately. However, some variations have attained
   notoriety, such as the waffle weave variation found among Type C badges
   and the large people vs. slender people variations among Family Life
   badges. Such variations were very common up until the 1940s and still
   occur, though not as often. Collectors find these variations
   interesting and collect such badges.

   Examples of positional shifts among the objects comprising the motif of
   a merit badge include changes in the precise positioning of the tent
   and the mountains among "Camping" Type H merit badges. Another example
   is the shift among the Scout, the mountains, and the clouds in Hiking
   Type H merit badges.

   Stitch patterns are not always consistent. There are three known
   stitching variations among the Type C Personal Health merit badges:
   "vertical heart", "horizontal heart", and "split heart"; the variation
   creates the appearance of a split down the middle of the heart. A
   similar error appears in both Type H and Type J Citizenship in the
   Nation badges, where colors vary in order from red, white, and blue to
   blue, white, and red; the reasons for this are unknown. Large and small
   bell varieties also exist. Emergency Preparedness was made with a red
   cross from 1972 until 1979, when it was replaced with a green cross in
   1980. This change was intentionally made. However, the colour of the
   green is not consistent; even today, it varies between dark green,
   medium green, light green, and yellow green.

Manufacturing errors

   Genuine manufacturing errors occur from time to time. Some Atomic
   Energy Type G badges were made without a nucleus. The only time a merit
   badge was made without a silver, green, or blue (aviation blues only)
   border was in 1987 when Whitewater Type H badges were made with a black
   border. Dairying appears in Type H with the cheese in both orange and
   burgundy. It is supposed to be orange.

   There have been at least three Type H badges made with little or no
   plastic; called plasticizing or Type G errors: American Cultures,
   Colonial Philadelphia, and Journalism. The "Colonial Philadelphia"
   patch was only available from 1975 until 1976 to Scouts in the
   Philadelphia region and could only be used for Eagle Palms.

   First Aid to Animals (FATA) Type H was made in error with a silver
   border in 1972. This is one of the most famous errors. It has a slight
   blue tint in the plastic back (see photos). It is believed that only
   about 100 of these were made and that only about 50 have survived to
   this day. Counterfeit versions of this badge error also exist.
   "Beekeeping" Type G is also known in silver border error. Neither one
   has ever been a required merit badge.

Design errors

   The known design errors are all from the early years. "Beekeeping" was
   made from 1914–1938 with only four legs instead of six simply because
   of human design error. "Beekeeping" also exists in thick and thin
   bodies in Type C. "Insect Life" was first made, from 1923–1924, with a
   spider on it. Since a spider is an arachnid, not an insect, the design
   was changed to an aphid the following year. As this particular merit
   badge specimen was only issued for one year, it is extremely rare.

Spoof merit badges

   Spoof merit badges are created and sold by various third-parties. These
   are not fakes of genuine merit badges, though they are the same size
   and have an outer green ring. To the unsuspecting buyer, these parodies
   appear to be real. Dozens of varieties exist, including badges for
   snoring, computer viruses, citizenship in the universe, snow art, text
   messaging, and whining. A proposal for a duct tape merit badge has
   gathered widespread support from humorists. A number of spoof merit
   badges could possibly be legitimate if the BSA ever authorized it;
   examples of this group include spoof badges for scuba diving and
   surfing.

   Spoofs of other BSA badges also exist, including those denoting
   training status and troop positions. Some of the better-known examples
   are: "Untrained", "Underpaid", "Retired", "Old Geezer", "Old Goat
   Patrol", and "Potty Trained". All spoof badges are unofficial and not
   recognized by the BSA.
