   This is a list of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom from when the
   first Prime Minister (in the modern sense), Robert Walpole, took office
   in 1721, until the present day.

Political party ideologies

Whigs and Tories: 1688-1832

   Robert Walpole (1721-1742) is regarded as the first Prime Minister of
   Great Britain and accepted 10 Downing Street in 1732 as the official
   residence of the First Lord of the Treasury.

   Robert Walpole (1721-1742) is regarded as the first Prime Minister of
   Great Britain and accepted 10 Downing Street in 1732 as the official
   residence of the First Lord of the Treasury.

   From the latter part of the 17th century until the early 19th, there
   were essentially two major political parties in Great Britain: the
   Whigs and Tories. Neither could be described as "modern" in the sense
   of organised voters working together, compromising their differences
   for the sake of gain at the polls. In the 18th century, the only voters
   were men of means: the landed aristocracy and wealthy merchants. They
   considered party organization as dishonest and activities such as
   campaigning beneath their status. A "gentleman" was expected to be
   independent, to think for himself and to protect his own interests. He
   might ally himself with others on a particular issue, but such
   alliances were temporary and fragile. The early political parties were
   loose groupings of like-minded individuals (called "factions") with
   little discipline and less loyalty.

   The party labels "Whig" and "Tory" began as derisive terms when they
   first appeared during the Exclusion crisis of 1678. Across the country
   people disagreed on the issue of whether or not James Stuart, Duke of
   York and heir to the throne, should be allowed to succeed King Charles
   II, his brother. The Tories believed that James should succeed, the
   Whigs that he should not.

   The origins of this dispute are found in the religious and political
   controversies of the previous one hundred and fifty years. With much
   bloodshed and trauma, the Tudor monarchs of the 16th century had broken
   with the Catholic Church, created an Anglican Church and formed a
   Protestant state. This new allegiance was confirmed during the Civil
   Wars and the Interregnum of 1649 - 1660. At the same time, England had
   also begun to embrace some modern democratic ideas which empowered
   Parliament and constrained the Monarchy. King Charles II was probably
   secretly a Catholic but at least adhered publicly to the Anglican
   faith. James however was openly Catholic and very devout. Some saw his
   Catholicism as a threat to all the religious and political changes that
   had taken place. Therefore, the Whigs, as they came to be known,
   opposed James' succession to the throne. Those who supported James'
   hereditary right to the crown came to be known as Tories.

   The term Whig was probably short for "Whiggamore" and referred to a
   horse thief; also to Scottish Presbyterians who were associated with
   republican ideas, with nonconformity, and with rebellion against
   legitimate authority. By calling them Whigs, the Tories tried to
   slander those who claimed the right to exclude the "legitimate" heir
   from the succession. In response, the Whigs tried to slander those who
   supported James' hereditary rights despite his faith by calling them
   "Tories." "Tory" was probably an Irish word meaning "papist outlaw."
   Both slanders backfired: each group embraced with pride the derisive
   term flung at them by their opponents.
   Sir Robert Peel (1834-1835 and 1841-1846), founded the modern
   Conservative Party in 1834 with the publication of the Tamworth
   Manifesto.

   Conservative Party in 1834 with the publication of the Tamworth
   Manifesto.

   The result of the initial struggle between the two "parties" during the
   succession crisis was that the Whigs lost and James became king when
   Charles II died in 1685. However, during his short reign of only three
   years, James II (1685 - 1688) managed to offend not only the Whigs but
   many Tories with his radical Catholicism and his claims to rule by
   "Divine Right", like the autocratic Catholic princes of Europe.
   Consequently, most Whigs and many Tories conspired to oust James during
   the Glorious Revolution of 1688. After a brief struggle, James
   ignominiously abandoned the throne and Parliament invited William of
   Orange and his wife Mary Stuart, both Protestants, to succeed jointly
   to the English crown.

   Although the succession crisis was the specific event that led to the
   formation of the two major parties, the differences between them ran
   much deeper. Generally those who identified themselves as Whigs were
   inspired by the values of liberal democracy brought about by the
   Enlightenment, and consisted of the noble houses, wealthy merchants and
   non- Anglicans. Those who identified themselves as Tory consisted of
   the landed gentry and the Church of England, and were opposed to the
   reformism of the Whigs, such as expanding the franchise and increased
   Parliamentary representation for lower classes.

   After 1688, most Tories accepted a limited version of the Whig theory
   of a Constitutional Monarchy. However, whether rightly or wrongly,
   their loyalty to the new order was suspect because they had supported
   James' succession in the first place. This suspicion was confirmed in
   1714 when the Tory ministers of the late Queen Anne (1702-1714) were
   disgraced for negotiating for the return of James II on her death. This
   uprising in favour of a Stuart restoration (and another one in 1745)
   stigmatized the Tories as supporters of absolute monarchy and as being
   opponents of the Protestant Succession. Except for a brief ascendancy
   from 1710 to 1714, the Tories were in a weak political position for
   almost one hundred years. The Whigs became so dominant after the first
   Jacobite uprising that the period from 1714 to 1784 is often called the
   "Whig Supremacy." Many of the Prime Ministers categorised as Whigs did
   not actively support a party policy: for them it was in practice merely
   their nominal label.

   With the French Revolution in 1789, and the ensuing wars, the Whigs
   split, with many aligning themselves with the then Prime Minister
   William Pitt the Younger against the Revolution. Pitt and his
   successors became known as Tories, originally as an insult, but by the
   time of the Earl of Liverpool they had accepted the term.

Conservative and Liberal: 1832-1922

   Clement Attlee (1945-1951) was the second Labour Prime Minister and
   introduced the post-war consensus, nationalised many utilities, and
   created the National Health Service.

   created the National Health Service.

   The Whig and Tory parties both altered after the enactment of the Great
   Reform Act of 1832. Two of the three major modern political parties,
   Conservative and Liberal, grew directly out of these earlier ones. The
   Conservative Party was founded in 1834 by Sir Robert Peel as a result
   of his Tamworth Manifesto, a speech in which he outlined the new
   political philosophy. The party has been consistently socially
   conservative but has shifted its position on economics, initially
   supporting free trade under Peel, then favouring protectionism for much
   of the nineteenth century, to become a party of economic liberalism and
   reduced government after World War II.

   The Liberal Party was formed after the collapse of the Whig party due
   to the enfranchisement of the British middle class following the Reform
   Act 1832, and has typically been a reforming party. From the 1840s
   until the 1940s it was strongly defined by its support for free trade
   and social welfare, in contrast to Conservative preference for
   protectionism and private charity. The Liberals were also known for
   their pragmatic support for state intervention in the economy where
   necessary, whereas the Conservatives opposed such intervention on
   ideological grounds. In its last government, from 1906-1922, it
   introduced a number of social reforms including welfare, regulation of
   working hours and national insurance. The division of the Liberal Party
   in the early 1920s led many previous supporters to switch their
   allegiance to the Labour Party. The Liberal Democrats, the successor
   party to the Liberal Party, are socially liberal and typically support
   higher taxation to support the welfare state, but have an increasing
   faction of economic liberals.

Conservative and Labour: 1922 to present

   The Labour Party was founded in 1900 to represent the views of the
   working class population and the trade union movement. The party has
   been traditionally socialist or social democratic in outlook, proven by
   the introduction of the welfare state and central planning in the
   United Kingdom in the 1940s. Following the electoral success of
   Thatcherism in the 1980s, the disastrous result of the 1983 general
   election for the Labour Party, and the electoral success of the
   SDP-Liberal Alliance, the Labour Party has moved towards a neo-liberal
   stance, as shown in the Third Way philosophy. Since entering government
   in 1997, some have argued that Labour has become increasingly right
   wing. Others, however, have pointed to large increases in social
   spending as evidence that the party remains committed to social
   democratic values.

20th century Prime Ministers

   There was no change in the jurisdiction of the Parliament of the United
   Kingdom (and hence the area the Prime Minister was Prime Minister of)
   until 1922, when following the Anglo-Irish War, 26 counties in Ireland
   seceded from the United Kingdom, forming the Irish Free State. The
   other 6 counties, in the northeast of Ireland, remained in the Union,
   becoming Northern Ireland. The official name of the United Kingdom
   became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
