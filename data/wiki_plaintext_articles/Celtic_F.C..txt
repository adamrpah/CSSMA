   Celtic Football Club (pronounced "seltik", /sɛltɪk/ in IPA) AIM: CCP is
   a Scottish football club, competing in the Scottish Premier League, the
   highest form of competition in Scotland. The club is based in the east
   end of the city of Glasgow.

   The club is officially nicknamed the Bhoys, or unofficially the Hoops.
   Although the full name of the club is The Celtic Football Club, it is
   often incorrectly called "Glasgow Celtic" (or "Celtic Glasgow"),
   particularly by foreign commentators and commentators trying to
   distinguish between Celtic and other teams with the name Celtic (most
   notably the NBA's Boston Celtics).

   Celtic play home games at Celtic Park, which is currently the second
   largest club stadium in the United Kingdom and was until the expansion
   of Old Trafford in recent years the largest in the UK. In 2005-06,
   Celtic Park attracted an average attendance of 58,149 , making Celtic
   second only to Manchester United in average attendance for any British
   football club.

   Together with their rivals, Rangers F.C., they form the Old Firm which
   is one of the most famous and fiercest rivalries in sport. The club has
   traditionally been identified with the Catholic community of Glasgow
   and has strong support from the Catholic population of Northern Ireland
   and the Republic of Ireland. Celtic's home kit is green and white
   hooped jerseys, white shorts and white socks.

   In 1967, Celtic became the first British team to win the European Cup.
   Before this historic win, no other club in Northern Europe had won the
   tournament, which had been the preserve of Italian, Portuguese and
   Spanish clubs. Celtic won every competition that they entered that
   season: Scottish League, Scottish FA Cup, Scottish League Cup, European
   Cup and the Glasgow Cup.

   Additionally, Celtic remain the only Scottish club ever to have reached
   the final, and are the only club ever to win the trophy with a team
   composed entirely of home-grown talent; all of the players in the side
   were Scottish, and all were born within a 30-mile radius of Celtic Park
   in Glasgow. Celtic again reached the European Cup final in 1970, only
   to be beaten by Feyenoord in extra time. In 2003 Martin O'Neill led the
   team to the UEFA Cup final in Seville where they lost 3-2 to F.C. Porto
   after extra time. Around 80,000 Celtic supporters travelled to Seville
   for the final.

Formation

   Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St.
   Mary's Roman Catholic Church hall on East Rose Street (now Forbes
   Street), Calton, Glasgow, by an Irish Marist brother named Brother
   Walfrid originally from County Sligo on 6 November 1887.

   The charity established by Brother Walfrid was named The Poor
   Children's Dinner Table. Walfrid's move to establish the club as a
   means of fund raising was largely inspired by the example of Hibernian
   F.C. who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years
   earlier in Edinburgh.

   On 28 May 1888, Celtic played their first official match against
   Rangers and won 5-2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter".
   Celtic had 8 'guest' players from Hibernian playing that day.

The Old Firm and sectarianism

   The term sectarian refers to a group who belongs to a religious and
   cultural sect, and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others,
   not belonging to their sect.

   Celtic have had a historic association with the peoples of Ireland. As
   a consequence, the club and its supporters have been embroiled in
   issues surrounding sectarianism. At its worst extreme this sectarianism
   has manifested itself in sectarian violence; the reproduction of
   cultural prejudices; and a perceived anti-Celtic bias (see History of
   Celtic F.C.), which some fans believe to be a part of a wider
   anti-Catholic bias in Scotland (see Irish-Scots).

   In the context of Scottish football, sectarianism is beyond the control
   of any individual football club. It is a much wider issue, rooted in
   social, cultural, historical and religious circumstances. Nevertheless,
   both Celtic and Rangers accept that they have a problem with
   sectarianism. Both Celtic and Rangers admit that a proportion of their
   supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating
   sectarian beliefs and cultural intolerance.

   Some Celtic fans with Republican sympathies sing IRA songs at games,
   and some Rangers fans, who are traditionally Loyalist, sing songs such
   as Billy Boys. In recent times both clubs have taken measures to combat
   sectarianism. Working alongside the Scottish Parliament, church groups
   and community organisations, the Old Firm has clamped down on sectarian
   songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using
   increased levels of policing and surveillance. In 1996, for instance,
   Celtic launched their Bhoys Against Bigotry campaign, later followed by
   Youth Against Bigotry to "educate the young on having ... respect for
   all aspects of the community - all races, all colours, all creeds",
   according to then chief executive Ian McLeod .

Recent seasons

2003-04

   After a draw in the opening game of the season, Celtic notched up a
   record-setting 25-match winning run, giving Celtic a healthy lead in
   the title race. Celtic did not lose a game until after the club's 39th
   championship was delivered.

   The 2003-04 season also saw Celtic notch up four league wins over
   Rangers, and one in the Scottish Cup - the first time in either club's
   history when a five-match "whitewash" had been achieved.

   Club hero Henrik Larsson played his final professional match for Celtic
   in the 2004 Scottish Cup Final victory over Dunfermline, scoring two
   goals, with Bulgarian Stilian Petrov's goal following Larsson's goals
   to overturn an early setback, and handing Celtic their second double
   under Martin O'Neill.

   Larsson is now widely acknowledged as one of the club's greatest ever
   players, and ranks amongst the top three goalscorers in the club's
   history.

2004-05

   Following a close race for the SPL title, with Rangers closely
   following, the club extended their lead at the top of the SPL table to
   two points as they lined up for the final game of the season, with a
   win at Motherwell F.C. required to seal the title. With two minutes
   remaining on the clock, Celtic were leading 1 – 0 — a result which
   would have handed them the league.

   However, Motherwell's Scott McDonald netted two last-minute goals.
   Rangers defeated Hibernian F.C. 1 – 0 at Easter Road, thereby winning
   the league championship title. Earlier in the season Celtic recorded a
   record seventh straight win over city rivals Rangers.

   Celtic ended the season one week later with a 1–0 win over Dundee
   United F.C. in the Scottish Cup Final, which was marked by fans as
   Martin O'Neill's final match as manager.

   On 25 May 2005, O'Neill announced he would resign as manager of Celtic
   at the end of 2004-05 season along with first team coach Steve Walford
   and assistant manager John Robertson. It was widely reported that
   O'Neill decided to take time out of football in order to care for his
   ailing wife Geraldine, who is ill with lymphoma.

   Martin O'Neill is now recognised as Celtic's most successful manager
   since Jock Stein, third greatest after Stein and Willie Maley and is
   credited with helping to restore some pride in Celtic's ability to
   compete on the European stage. However, O'Neill was not able to emulate
   Stein's dominance of the game in Scotland and in Europe.

2005-06

   Former Aberdeen F.C. player and Scotland international Gordon Strachan
   from Edinburgh took charge of the club on 1 June 2005, on a 12-month
   rolling contract, similar to O'Neill's arrangement with the club; his
   contract effectively extending for one calendar year from any current
   date. Garry Pendrey was appointed as Strachan's assistant manager.

   In his first competitive match, against Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July
   2005, Celtic lost 5-0 in the first leg of an important Champions League
   2nd Round qualifier, suffering the worst European defeat in the club's
   history and the widest margin of defeat since the 1963-64 season, when
   the club lost 6-0 to Kilmarnock F.C. at Rugby Park.

   In Strachan's first domestic match of the 2005-06 SPL season, Celtic
   relinquished a 3-1 half-time lead over Motherwell F.C. at Fir Park on
   30 July 2005, the game ending in a 4-4 draw after Celtic managed to
   equalise through a goal by Craig Beattie.

   The nine goals against Celtic in Strachan's first two competitive
   matches is the biggest goal tally scored against the club in successive
   matches for 14 years.

   In the return leg of the Champions League 2nd Round qualifier against
   Artmedia at Celtic Park, Strachan's vastly improved side won 4-0 but
   were eliminated from European competition 5-4 on aggregate.

   However, following these setbacks, and a defeat against Rangers in the
   pair's first match of the season at Ibrox, Celtic recorded a series of
   victories, including beating Rangers twice, and returned to the top of
   the SPL - a vast improvement on their form at the start of the season.

   Celtic knocked arch rivals Rangers out of the League cup on 19 November
   2005. Celtic were knocked out of the Scottish Cup on 8 January 2006 by
   First Division side Clyde F.C.

   Celtic beat Rangers again on 12 February to make it 17 wins from the
   previous 21 Old Firm games. Celtic won the CIS Cup, with a 3-0 win over
   Dunfermline Athletic on 19 March. They created a new scoring record for
   the SPL, an 8-1 victory against Dunfermline in February 2006, where
   Maciej Żurawski scored 4 goals and assisted in 2 others.

   On 5 April 2006 Celtic clinched their 40th title thanks to a goal from
   John Hartson in a 1-0 win against Hearts at Celtic Park. The title was
   Celtic's fourth title in six years. This feat was achieved with six
   games remaining until the end of the season and before the SPL split.
   The Bhoys lifted the SPL trophy on Easter Sunday 2006 at home to
   Hibernian, after a 1-1 draw.

   In April 2006, Celtic's reserve and Under-19 teams also won their
   championships, completing a clean sweep of Scotland's league
   competitions. Celtic's reserve team have now won their league 5 years
   in a row and the Under-19 have won their league 4 years in a row.

2006-07

   Such was the good form of Celtic and the lack of a clear rival in the
   early stages of the 2006/07 season, that bookmakers Paddy Power took
   the unprecedented step of paying out on Celtic as the winners of the
   SPL on 4 November 2006, only 13 games into the season. By mid-November
   Celtic were 15 points clear of their nearest challengers. On November
   21, Celtic defeated Manchester United 1-0 at home thanks to a Nakamura
   freekick and a Boruc penalty save in the Champions League, which earned
   them qualification to the knockout stage of the last 16 teams for the
   first time since the format was altered in 1993.
