   The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2004,
   and lasted until November 30, 2004. These dates conventionally delimit
   the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the
   Atlantic basin. However, the 2004 season exceeded these conventional
   limits slightly, as Tropical Storm Otto formed on the last day of the
   season and lasted two days into December. The season was well above
   average in activity, with fifteen named storms and one of the highest
   Accumulated Cyclone Energy totals ever observed.

   The season was notable as one of the deadliest and most costly Atlantic
   hurricane seasons on record, with at least 3,132 deaths and roughly $42
   billion (2004 US dollars) in damage. The most notable storms for the
   season were the four hurricanes that made landfall in the U.S. state of
   Florida, three of them with at least 115 mph (185 km/h) sustained
   winds: Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. Jeanne wreaked havoc in
   Haiti, killing approximately 3,000 people, while Ivan raged through
   Grenada, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands; Frances and Jeanne both hit
   the Bahamas at full force, while Charley caused significant damage in
   Cuba. Furthermore, all four of these hurricanes, as well as one
   tropical storm, hit the U.S. state of Florida, with Frances and Jeanne
   hitting nearly the exact same location within three weeks of each
   other; floodwaters in the southeastern United States were brought to
   near-record levels.

Pre-season outlook

   On May 17, prior to the start of the season, NOAA forecasters predicted
   a 50% probability of activity above the normal range, with 12–15
   tropical storms, 6–8 of those becoming hurricanes, and 2–4 of those
   hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 strength on the Saffir-Simpson
   Hurricane Scale.

   Noted hurricane expert Dr. William Gray's May 28 prediction was
   similar, with 14 named storms, 8 reaching hurricane strength, and 3
   reaching Category 3 strength.

Mid-season outlook

   On August 6, Dr. Gray announced he had revised his predictions slightly
   downwards, citing mild El Niño conditions, to 13 named storms, 7
   hurricanes, and 3 reaching category 3. Several days later, NOAA
   released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of
   above-to-near normal activity, but the same number of storms forecast.

   A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 6 to 14 tropical storms, 4 to
   8 of which reach hurricane strength, and 1 to 3 of those reaching
   Category 3 strength.

   The season ended up with 16 tropical depressions, 15 named storms, 9
   hurricanes, and six major hurricanes, placing it well above all
   forecasts.

   This season had 16 tropical depressions, 15 named storms, 9 hurricanes,
   and 6 major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson
   Hurricane Scale). The Accumulated Cyclone Energy figure of 225 ranks
   this as the fourth most active season since 1950 (behind the 2005
   season, the 1950 season and the 1995 season).

   August 2004 was unusually active, with eight named storms forming
   during the month. In an average year, only three or four storms would
   be named in August. The formation of eight named storms in August
   breaks the old record of seven for the month, set in the 1933 and 1995
   seasons. It also ties with September in the 2002 season for the most
   Atlantic tropical storms to form in any month.

Deaths and damage

   The 2004 season was very deadly, with over 3,000 deaths related to the
   flooding rains or winds caused by the storms. Nearly all of the deaths
   were reported in Haiti following the floods and mudslides caused by
   then-Tropical Storm Jeanne.

   A tropical low in May brought torrential flooding to Haiti and the
   Dominican Republic, killing 2,000 people and causing great damage.
   Though it was not officially classified as a tropical storm, it did
   have a circulation with loosely organized convection, resembling a
   subtropical cyclone.

Records and notable events

   The 2004 season had numerous unusual occurrences. The first named storm
   of the season formed on August 1, giving the season the fifth-latest
   start since the 1952 season. Tropical Storm Bonnie and Hurricane
   Charley became the first storms to sequentially hit the same U.S. state
   — Florida — within 24 hours of each other in recorded history. For the
   remainder of the season, Florida was hit by three more hurricanes:
   Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. It was the first time four hurricanes have
   hit one state in one season since four hurricanes hit the Texas coast
   in the 1886 season, including the Indianola Hurricane of 1886 that
   destroyed the city of Indianola.

   Other storms were individually unusual. Hurricane Alex was the
   strongest hurricane on record to intensify north of 38°N latitude. One
   storm, Tropical Storm Earl, died out, and its remains crossed over into
   the Pacific Ocean, regenerated, and became Hurricane Frank in the
   eastern Pacific.
   Hurricane Jeanne caused severe damage in Florida, Haiti, and other
   Caribbean countries.

   The most unusual storm of the season was Hurricane Ivan. Ivan first
   impressed meteorologists by becoming the first major Atlantic hurricane
   (Category 3 or above) on record to form as low as 10ºN latitude. Ivan
   was also recorded as the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on
   record up to that point (afterwards pushed to 9th by 2005's Katrina,
   Rita and Wilma), with a minimum central pressure of 910 mbar ( hPa).
   One very unusual occurrence in relation to Ivan happened on September
   22, when a remnant low from Ivan — which had traveled in a circular
   motion over the southeastern United States — was reclassified as a
   tropical depression as it moved over the Gulf of Mexico. The system was
   given the name Ivan and eventually strengthened into a respectable
   tropical storm with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) before making landfall
   along the coast of Texas, causing minimal flooding and damage.

   Although not part of the Atlantic hurricane season, one event in the
   South Atlantic was so unusual as to merit mention. On March 25, a
   tropical cyclone (unofficially named Cyclone Catarina) formed in the
   South Atlantic. Catarina is considered to be the first tropical cyclone
   to have formed in the South Atlantic since satellite observations
   began. It made landfall late on March 27 in the Brazilian state of
   Santa Catarina. The storm killed at least three and caused over $350
   million (2004 USD) in damage.

Storms

Hurricane Alex


                                                          Hurricane Alex 3


                              Hurricane alex2 2004.jpg Alex 2004 track.png

                              Duration                   July 31— August 6
                             Intensity     120  mph (190  km/h), 957  mbar

   The first storm of the season formed at the end of July off the coast
   of South Carolina. Alex strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane, and
   on August 3 came within 10 miles (16 km) of the Outer Banks of North
   Carolina without making landfall. Damage was limited to flooding and
   wind damage, and in Dare County, North Carolina, was estimated at $2.4
   million. One minor injury was reported.

   Alex later headed out to sea and strengthened to a Category 3
   hurricane, making it only the second hurricane on record to have
   reached Category 3 strength north of 38° N latitude, before becoming
   extratropical over the north Atlantic.

   For the official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Hurricane Alex.

Tropical Storm Bonnie


                                                  Tropical Storm Bonnie TS


                                  TS Bonnie 2004.jpg Bonnie 2004 track.png

                                  Duration             August 3— August 14
                                 Intensity 65  mph (100  km/h), 1001  mbar

   On August 3, a tropical wave approaching the Lesser Antilles organized
   into Tropical Depression Two. As the storm traveled west over the
   islands, it dissipated on August 4. The remnants of Tropical Depression
   Two continued westward and, on August 9, had strengthened into Tropical
   Storm Bonnie in the Yucatan Channel. Although appearing disorganized,
   Bonnie showed unusual structure, with a closed eye wall and a ten-mile
   (16 km) wide eye being reported by hurricane hunters late on August 9
   and early on August 10, a feature almost unheard of in tropical
   cyclones of that intensity. Bonnie was a very small storm, with
   tropical storm-force winds extending only 30 miles (50 km) out from the
   centre. Upper level shear weakened the storm, and Bonnie made landfall
   as a 45 mph tropical storm just south of Apalachicola, Florida on
   August 12. It accelerated northeastward, and became a remnant area of
   low pressure on August 14 to the southeast of New Jersey.

   Bonnie caused minor to moderate damage across its path. In the
   southeast United States, the storm caused a tornado outbreak that
   caused $500,000 (2004 USD) in damage and 3 deaths. In New Brunswick,
   slick rains from the remnants of Bonnie caused an indirect fatality.

Hurricane Charley


                                                       Hurricane Charley 4


                         Hurricane Charley 2004.jpg Charley 2004 track.png

                         Duration                      August 9— August 14
                        Intensity          150  mph (240  km/h), 941  mbar

   Hurricane Charley formed east of the Windward Islands on August 9 and
   moved rapidly west across the Caribbean. As it neared Jamaica, it
   became a hurricane and grazed that island on August 11, passing through
   the Cayman Islands the next morning. On August 12, Charley passed over
   mainland Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane just west of Havana.

   On August 13, Charley unexpectedly underwent rapid strengthening,
   jumping from a Category 2 to a powerful Category 4 storm in a few
   hours, while at the same time taking a sharp turn to the northeast.
   Charley made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane near Port Charlotte,
   Florida. Although the storm caused serious damage, much of this was
   limited to a narrow swath associated with the hurricane's eye wall.
   Charley was a very fast-moving, compact storm, and so much of its
   damage was attributed to high winds rather than heavy rain, as is the
   case in most hurricanes. Charley remained a hurricane across the entire
   Florida peninsula and passed near Orlando and Daytona Beach. It later
   made a second landfall near North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on
   August 14. Charley dissipated near Cape Cod, Massachusetts on August
   15.

   Charley caused approximately $14 billion in damage to the United
   States, making it the fourth costliest hurricane in U.S. history.
   Fifteen deaths were directly attributed to Charley; four in Jamaica,
   one in Cuba, and ten in Florida.

   For the official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Hurricane Charley.

Hurricane Danielle


                                                      Hurricane Danielle 2


          Hurricane Danielle 16 aug 2004 1815Z.jpg Danielle 2004 track.png

          Duration                                    August 13— August 21
         Intensity                         110  mph (175  km/h), 964  mbar

   At 11 a.m. AST on August 13, a tropical wave formed into Tropical
   Depression Four around 275 miles (440 km) southeast of Cape Verde. It
   was the first of five Cape Verde-type hurricanes of 2004. Twelve hours
   later, TD4 strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Danielle. Late on
   August 14, Danielle's wind speeds increased, and it was classified as a
   hurricane. Danielle moved northwest, peaking at Category Two. It was
   predicted to curve towards the Azores, but on August 18 lost motion and
   slackened to a tropical storm. By August 19, the storm had become
   stationary with minimal storm strength 810 miles (1305 km) southwest of
   the Azores. The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression the next
   day, and degenerated to a broad low-pressure area on August 21.

   For the official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Hurricane
   Danielle.

Tropical Storm Earl


                                                    Tropical Storm Earl TS


                        Tropical Storm Earl (2004).jpg Earl 2004 track.png

                        Duration                      August 13— August 16
                       Intensity            50  mph (80  km/h), 1009  mbar

   Earl formed initially as the fifth tropical depression of the season on
   August 13 east of the Lesser Antilles. After traveling west, it reached
   tropical storm strength on August 14 around 375 miles (605 km)
   southeast of Barbados. On August 15, Earl passed just south of Grenada
   and entered the Caribbean. The storm had degenerated by that point, and
   that night would have been classified as a tropical wave. However, the
   government of Venezuela denied access to their airspace for storm
   reconnaissance aircraft. An on-site assessment of Earl's circulation
   was needed, since satellite observations are inaccurate for that
   purpose. Earl also posed a threat to land, so advisories continued for
   another 12 hours.

   The next morning a reconnaissance aircraft was able to reach the storm.
   It found no closed circulation, and Earl was reclassified as a tropical
   wave at 11 a.m. AST on August 16. Remnants of the storm continued
   across the Caribbean and into Central America, later becoming Tropical
   Depression 8E and then Hurricane Frank in the Pacific Ocean (the first
   time since 1996, when Hurricane Cesar became Douglas in the Pacific).
   Earl caused minor damage to Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

   For the official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Tropical Storm
   Earl. See also 2004 Pacific hurricane season for information on Earl
   after it crossed oceans.

Hurricane Frances


                                                       Hurricane Frances 4


                         Hurricane Frances 2004.jpg Frances 2004 track.png

                         Duration                  August 25— September 10
                        Intensity          145  mph (230  km/h), 935  mbar

   Frances began as Tropical Depression Six on August 24, and it became a
   named storm on August 25 while well east of the Windward Islands.
   Frances strengthened rapidly, reaching Category 4 intensity by August
   27. Initially forecast to turn north and potentially threaten Bermuda,
   conditions changed and Frances's predicted track shifted westward.
   After grazing the Turks and Caicos Islands, it plowed through the
   Bahamas. From September 2 through September 4, Frances slowly ground
   its way across the Bahamas. Its slow movement allowed a record 2.5 to 3
   million Floridians to evacuate their homes. However, as it ground its
   way across the Bahamas, it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane due to
   wind shear, although it was still a very large storm.

   After sitting stationary off the coast of Florida for nearly 24 hours,
   Frances finally moved onto the coast of Florida in the early hours of
   September 5. It traveled northwest over land, briefly emerging over the
   Gulf of Mexico and striking the Florida panhandle. As it passed over
   Georgia on September 6, it caused heavy rainfall across the southern
   U.S. Over 15 inches of rain were recorded in some places in North
   Carolina and Virginia, causing heavy flooding. Frances was downgraded
   to a tropical depression and dissipated over Pennsylvania on September
   9.

   Damage to the United States was approximately $9 billion, making it the
   10th costliest hurricane in U.S. history. Most of Hurricane Frances's
   damage occurred in Florida as a result of the storm's slow movement,
   large size, and long duration of winds. The storm is directly
   responsible for seven deaths; one in the Bahamas and six in the United
   States. Hurricane Frances also produced a record-setting 123 tornadoes
   as it moved its way through the United States.

                           Hurricane Gaston 2004.jpg Gaston 2004 track.png

                           Duration                 August 27— September 1
                          Intensity         75  mph (120  km/h), 986  mbar

   Tropical Depression Seven formed at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 UTC) on August 27,
   around 140 miles (225 km) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The
   depression meandered off the coast for the rest of the day,
   strengthening into Tropical Storm Gaston by midday August 28. At 10
   a.m. EDT (1400 UTC) on August 29, Gaston made landfall on the coast of
   Bulls Bay, South Carolina, near the towns of McClellanville and
   Awendaw. It was downgraded to a tropical depression later that day. The
   storm made landfall in almost the same location as Hurricane Hugo in
   1989.

   At landfall the storm was originally classified as just shy of
   hurricane strength. While wind damage in South Carolina was minimal,
   the slow-moving storm produced five to ten inches (125 to 250 mm) of
   rain along its path, causing extensive flooding. Gaston moved north
   over land, weakening to a tropical depression but still bringing
   torrential rain to central Virginia, where at least eight people were
   killed in the ensuing floods. The Shockoe Bottom entertainment district
   near downtown Richmond was devastated by the flooding. Total damage was
   estimated at about $130 million.

   Late on August 30, as Tropical Depression Gaston crossed Chesapeake
   Bay, its winds strengthened, and it was again classified as a tropical
   storm. It headed out over the Atlantic and became extratropical on
   September 1, about 185 miles (300 km) southeast of Halifax, Nova
   Scotia.

   On November 19, after a detailed analysis by the NHC, surface-level
   winds were determined to be about 75 mph (120 km/h) at landfall, and
   Gaston was reclassified as a Category 1 hurricane.

   For official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Hurricane Gaston.

                               Intensity    60  mph (95  km/h), 1002  mbar

   Hermine formed out of an organized area of disturbed weather that had
   formed about 325 miles (520 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North
   Carolina, or 360 miles (580 km) west of Bermuda, and moved rapidly
   north towards Cape Cod. On its northward trek, Hermine left behind most
   of its convection. The storm made landfall near New Bedford,
   Massachusetts, early on August 31, appearing as little more than a
   low-level swirl of clouds. It became extratropical a few hours later.
   The remnant low centre tracked up the Bay of Fundy later on August 31.
   Some rainfall and thunderstorms over Long Island and parts of New
   England were attributed to Hermine, but most people did not realize a
   tropical storm had struck.

   There were no casualties or reports of major damage caused by Hermine.
   Locally heavy rain did fall in portions of southern New Brunswick,
   which received 40-55 mm. Minor basement flooding and street closures
   were also reported in Moncton, New Brunswick.

   Hermine.

Hurricane Ivan


                                                         Hurricane Ivan 5


                                   Hurricane Ivan.jpg Ivan 2004 track.png

                                  Duration       September 2— September 24
                                 Intensity 165  mph (265  km/h), 910  mbar

   Ivan was a Cape Verde-type hurricane that began as Tropical Depression
   Nine on September 2. It became a tropical storm on September 3, and a
   hurricane on September 5 while 1,040 miles (1670 km) east of the
   Windward Islands, at 9.9° N. Later that day, while at 10.6° N, it
   unexpectedly underwent rapid strengthening, reaching Category 4
   intensity by that evening. It was the strongest storm to have ever been
   known to intensify that far south. Ivan weakened slightly while
   continuing westward, and struck Grenada on September 7.

   While moving westward through the Caribbean Sea, Ivan quickly
   intensified to a Category 5 hurricane. It fluctuated in strength over
   the next few days, and passed within 30 miles (50 km) of Grand Cayman
   on September 11. Ivan grazed western Cuba as a Category 5, and moved
   into the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane turned northward over cooler
   waters, and made landfall in southern Alabama on September 16 as a 120
   mph (195 km/h) hurricane. Ivan weakened rapidly to a tropical
   depression over Alabama, accelerated to the northeast, and became
   extratropical over the Delmarva Peninsula on September 18. Ivan's
   remnants turned to the southeast then southwest, and gradually
   re-organized over the warm Gulf Stream waters. After crossing southern
   Florida on September 21 the system regained tropical characteristics
   over the Gulf of Mexico, and became a tropical storm on September 23
   while 140 miles (220 km) south of Louisiana. Ivan moved to the
   northwest, and reached winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) before making landfall
   near Cameron, Louisiana. Ivan quickly deteriorated over Texas, and
   dissipated on September 24.

   Hurricane Ivan directly killed 92 people throughout the Caribbean and
   United States and caused approximately $13 billion in damage to the
   United States, making it the fifth costliest hurricane in United States
   history. The hurricane destroyed 90% of Grenada's structures and
   devastated the island's economy, and destroyed 85% of the buildings on
   Grand Cayman. The combination of Hurricane Ivan with the previous rains
   of Frances brought many rivers in the Southeastern U.S. to near-record
   flood levels. Ivan was the strongest storm of the season, and the only
   2004 Atlantic hurricane to reach Category 5 intensity. Its low pressure
   reading of 910 mbar made it the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane
   on record at the time.

Tropical Depression Ten


                                               Tropical Depression Ten TD


                                      TD ten 2004.jpg 10-L 2004 track.png

                                   Duration       September 7— September 9
                                  Intensity 35  mph (60  km/h), 1013  mbar

   In addition to the fifteen named storms, there was a single tropical
   depression, Tropical Depression 10, which did not strengthen into a
   tropical storm. It formed on September 7 from a tropical wave, and
   after moving northeastward it dissipated near the Azores on September
   9.

   Depression Ten

Hurricane Jeanne


                                                        Hurricane Jeanne 3


                           Hurricane jeanne 2004.jpg Jeanne 2004 track.png

                           Duration             September 13— September 28
                          Intensity        120  mph (190  km/h), 951  mbar

   Jeanne formed as a tropical depression east-southeast of Guadeloupe on
   the evening of September 13. Having strengthened to a tropical storm,
   Jeanne crossed Puerto Rico on September 15. It then moved toward
   Hispaniola, barely reaching hurricane strength before making landfall
   on September 16. It tracked slowly across the northern coast of the
   Dominican Republic and Haiti, its heavy rains bringing mudslides and
   flooding. Jeanne's unusually slow journey was actually caused by a
   weakening Hurricane Ivan. Ivan broke up a trough that was fueling
   Jeanne's steering currents. Interaction with Hispaniola caused it to
   degenerate into a tropical depression.

   After wreaking havoc on Hispaniola, Jeanne struggled to reorganize.
   However, it eventually began strengthening and headed north. After
   performing a complete loop over the open Atlantic, it headed westwards,
   strengthening into a Category 3 hurricane and passing over the islands
   of Great Abaco and Grand Bahama in the Bahamas on September 25. Jeanne
   made landfall later in the day in Florida just 2 miles (3 kilometers)
   from where Frances had struck 3 weeks earlier. Building on the rainfall
   of Frances and Ivan, Jeanne brought near-record flood levels as far
   north as West Virginia and New Jersey before its remnants turned east
   into the open Atlantic.

   Jeanne is blamed for at least 3,006 deaths in Haiti with about 2,800 in
   Gonaïves alone, which was nearly washed away by floods and mudslides.
   The storm also caused 7 deaths in Puerto Rico, 18 in the Dominican
   Republic and at least 4 in Florida, bringing the total number of deaths
   to at least 3,025. Final property damage in the United States was
   $6,800,000,000, making this the 13th costliest hurricane in U.S.
   history.

Hurricane Karl


                                                          Hurricane Karl 4


                 Hurricane Karl 21 sept 2004 1315Z.jpg Karl 2004 track.png

                 Duration                       September 16— September 28
                Intensity                  145  mph (230  km/h), 938  mbar

   Tropical Depression Twelve formed from a tropical wave about 670 miles
   (1,080 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands on September 16. It
   became Tropical Storm Karl at 11 p.m. AST (0300 UTC) that day. Early on
   September 18, it strengthened rapidly to become a hurricane and was a
   major hurricane later that day.

   Karl continued strengthening and became a 145 mph (230 km/h) Category 4
   hurricane on September 21. It fluctuated in intensity over the next few
   days, reaching Category 4 strength on two different occasions. It moved
   steadily northwards, staying hundreds of miles from any land, until it
   began to weaken and become extratropical over cooler waters. Karl was
   still of Category 1 strength when it became an extratropical system on
   September 24 over the far northern Atlantic at about 47° N. The
   extratropical system struck the Faeroe Islands two days later with 144
   km/h (89 mph) wind gusts.

   For official forecasts see the NHC's public advisory archive on
   Hurricane Karl.

Hurricane Lisa


                                                          Hurricane Lisa 1


                  Hurricane Lisa 02 oct 2004 1300Z.jpg Lisa 2004 track.png

                  Duration                         September 19— October 3
                 Intensity                  75  mph (120  km/h), 987  mbar

   Tropical Depression Thirteen developed from a tropical wave 650 miles
   (1,045 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands on September 19. It
   became Tropical Storm Lisa at 8 a.m. AST on September 20 with maximum
   sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h). A very small storm, its
   development was hindered by its proximity to Hurricane Karl. On
   September 22, Lisa began merging with a large tropical disturbance to
   its east and weakened to a tropical depression for a couple of days
   before regaining tropical storm strength on September 25. By then it
   was heading generally northwards in the mid-Atlantic. Lisa went through
   several phases of weakening and strengthening as it headed north,
   finally reaching hurricane strength on October 1, and again the next
   day.

   At the time, Lisa earned the record for being a named tropical cyclone
   (i.e., after first reaching Tropical Storm strength) for 11 days before
   becoming a hurricane. ( Hurricane Dennis of 1981 took longer overall
   but dropped to a tropical wave before regenerating.) However, Hurricane
   Irene beat this record in the 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season.
   (Subsequent reevaluation determined that Lisa only became a hurricane
   on October 2, after 11¾ days as a named cyclone. Its total development
   time from tropical depression to hurricane, at 12½ days, is second only
   to Hurricane Josephine of 1990.)

   Lisa was a hurricane only briefly, moving over cooler waters and
   weakening to a tropical storm. It became extratropical early on October
   3 while located about 475 miles (760 km) north-northwest of the Azores.
   It never threatened any land area.

   For official forecasts see the NHC's public advisory archive on
   Hurricane Lisa.

Tropical Storm Matthew


                                                 Tropical Storm Matthew TS


                  Tropical Storm Matthew (2004).jpg Matthew 2004 track.png

                  Duration                           October 8— October 10
                 Intensity                   45  mph (70  km/h), 997  mbar

   Matthew began with a tropical wave that entered the southwestern Gulf
   of Mexico. This wave grew into a large area of low pressure in the
   western Gulf. The nontropical low began feeding moisture into a cold
   front that was traversing the United States, causing heavy rainfall
   across Louisiana, East Texas, and Arkansas.

   On the afternoon of October 8, the low pressure system developed into
   Tropical Storm Matthew 260 miles (420 km) east-southeast of
   Brownsville, Texas. Matthew was a minimal tropical storm, and its
   sustained winds stayed at or near 40 mph (64 km/h) from its naming
   until landfall on October 10. It became extratropical inland over
   Louisiana later in the day, and dissipated when it was near El Dorado,
   Arkansas.

   Matthew brought up to 12 inches (300 mm) of rain to southern Louisiana.
   About a dozen homes were flooded in Terrebonne Parish after a canal
   levee burst, and streets in St. Bernard Parish were reportedly under 2
   feet (60 cm) of water. The remnants of Matthew continued to spin inland
   and delivered heavy rainfall for at least five more days. No injuries
   or deaths were reported.

Subtropical Storm Nicole


                                               Subtropical Storm Nicole SS


                    STS Nicole 10 oct 2004 1530Z.jpg Nicole 2004 track.png

                    Duration                        October 10— October 11
                   Intensity                 50  mph (85  km/h), 986  mbar

   Early on October 10, the National Hurricane Centre determined that a
   low-pressure system to the west of Bermuda had acquired sufficient
   organization to be named Subtropical Storm Nicole. It brought light
   rain to Bermuda and briefly threatened it before heading towards the
   northeast. Nicole continued heading generally northeastward over cooler
   waters and was declared fully extratropical on October 11 while 345
   miles (555 km) south-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Canadian
   Hurricane Centre continued to issue advisories on, as they called it,
   post-tropical Storm Nicole (actually a system absorbed by another
   extratropical low) for another day as it moved closer to land and
   dropped heavy rainfall on the Maritimes. The low containing the
   remnants of Nicole finally merged with another larger low-pressure area
   while in the vicinity of Anticosti Island on October 14. No injuries or
   deaths were reported.

   Since 2002, subtropical storms have been assigned names from the same
   sequence as tropical storms. Nicole was the first named storm under
   this dispensation that never achieved tropical status.

   For official forecasts, see the NHC's public advisory archive on
   Subtropical Storm Nicole.

Tropical Storm Otto

                          Tropical Storm Otto 2004.jpg Otto 2004 track.png

                          Duration                 November 29— December 2
                         Intensity           50  mph (80  km/h), 995  mbar

   After a period of inactivity lasting seven weeks, Tropical Storm Otto
   formed on November 30, the last day of the official hurricane season.
   It developed from a nontropical low-pressure system over the central
   North Atlantic Ocean. Otto moved generally south and southwest for a
   few days as a minimal tropical storm before degenerating on December 2.

   For official forecasts, see the NHC's public advisory archive on
   Tropical Storm Otto.

   The tropical storms of 2004 ranked from highest to lowest Accumulated
   Cyclone Energy (ACE) given to three significant figures. The total for
   the season was 225. This makes it the fourth most energetic season
   since 1950.

   ACE measures the strength and duration of a tropical cyclone. Hurricane
   Ivan, because it was such a long lasting and strong Cape Verde-type
   hurricane, contributed almost one-third of the ACE value for 2004. Ivan
   had the second-highest ACE of any tropical cyclone recorded in the
   Atlantic, behind only Hurricane San Ciriaco of 1899.

Storm names

   The following names were used for named storms that formed in the
   Atlantic basin in 2004. The names not retired from this list will be
   used again in the 2010 season. This is the same list used for the 1998
   season except for Gaston and Matthew, which replaced Georges and Mitch.
   Storms were named Gaston, Matthew, and Otto for the first time in 2004.
   Names that were not assigned are marked in gray.

Retirement

   The World Meteorological Organization retired four names in the spring
   of 2005: Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. They will be replaced in
   2010 by Colin, Fiona, Igor, and Julia. The 2004 season was tied with
   the 1955 season and 1995 season for the most storm names retired after
   a single season until the 2005 season, when five names were retired.
