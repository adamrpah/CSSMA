   The name kestrel is given to several different members of the falcon
   genus, Falco. Kestrels are most easily distinguished by their typical
   hunting behaviour which is to hover at a height of around 10â€“20 m over
   open country and swoop down on prey, usually small mammals, lizards or
   large insects. Other falcons are more adapted to active hunting on the
   wing.

   Kestrels require a slight headwind in order to hover, hence a local
   name of windhover for Common Kestrel. Their ability to spot prey is
   enhanced by being able to see ultraviolet which is strongly reflected
   by vole urine.

   Plumage typically differs between male and female, and (as is usual
   with monogamous raptors) the female is slightly larger than the male.
   This allows a pair to fill different feeding niches over their home
   range. Kestrels are bold and have adapted well to human encroachment,
   nesting in buildings and hunting by major roads.

   Kestrels do not build their own nests, but use nests built by other
   species.
