   In the Whyte notation, a 4-6-0 is a railroad steam locomotive that has
   a two-axle leading truck followed by three driving axles. This wheel
   arrangement became the second-most popular configuration for new steam
   locomotives in America in the mid-19th century. It is commonly called a
   Ten-wheeler.

   The equivalent UIC classification is 2'C.

   signature feature of the railroad.

   The first 4-6-0 built in America was the Chesapeake. It was built by
   Norris in March 1847 for the Philadelphia and Reading railroad. There
   is still a question as to who was the original designer of this type.
   Many authorities attribute the design to Septimus Norris, but in a
   paper written in 1885, George E. Sellers attributes the design to John
   Brandt.

   Brandt worked for the Erie Railway between 1842 and 1851. The Erie's
   own management didn't feel it in their best interests to pursue
   construction, so Brandt showed the design to Baldwin and Norris.
   Baldwin was similarly unimpressed, but Norris liked the idea. According
   to Sellers, James Millholland, of the Reading, saw the 4-6-0 design as
   well and ordered one from Norris for the Reading. However, Sellers may
   have misrecalled a few of the specifics as Millholland did not work for
   the Reading until 1848, a year later. Also, Sellers lists the first
   4-6-0 constructed as the Susquehanna, which was the Erie railroad's
   first 4-6-0.

   The attribution to Septimus Norris lies in a patent that many sources
   cite for this locomotive type that was filed in 1846. However, such a
   patent has not yet been found in searches at the USPTO. Septimus Norris
   did file a patent in 1854 for running gears, and the patent application
   showed a 4-6-0 in the drawing. Norris' wording in the 1854 patent was
   vague in regard to the 4-6-0 wheel arrangement; the filing didn't
   specifically claim invention of the 4-6-0 type.

   A few days after William Norris completed the Chesapeake, Hinkley
   completed their first 4-6-0, the New Hampshire for the Boston and Maine
   Railroad. The first 4-6-0 from Rogers was the previously mentioned
   Susquehanna for the Erie Railroad.

   Baldwin's first 4-6-0 did not appear until 1852. Through the 1860s and
   into the 1870s, demand for the 4-6-0 grew as more railroad executives
   switched from purchasing a single, general-purpose type of locomotive
   (at that time, the 4-4-0), to purchasing locomotives for specific
   purposes. Both the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Baltimore and Ohio
   were early adopters of the 4-6-0, using them for fast freight and heavy
   passenger trains.

   The first 4-6-0 to be introduced to Britain was the Highland Railway
   Jones Goods Class in 1894, but the type later mostly found use as mixed
   traffic and passenger locomotives, British freight trains being
   generally too slow to require a four-wheel leading truck.
