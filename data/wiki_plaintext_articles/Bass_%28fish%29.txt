   Bass ( IPA /b√¶s/) is a name shared by many different species of popular
   game fish. The term encompasses both freshwater and marine species,
   many of which are native to North America and surrounding waters. All
   belong to the large order Perciformes, or perch-like fishes, and in
   fact the word bass comes from Middle English bars, meaning "perch."Bass
   can measure up to 80 cm (although expetional 100 cm long bass have been
   recorded)

   These are some of the most well-known species of bass:
     * The temperate basses, such as the striped bass (Morone saxatilis)
       and white bass (M. chrysops), belonging to the family Moronidae.
     * The warm water basses, such as the largemouth bass (Micropterus
       salmoides), smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu), spotted bass (M.
       punctulatus), Guadalupe bass (M. treculii) and rock bass
       (Ambloplites rupestris), belonging to the sunfish family,
       Centrarchidae. These basses are also referred to as black basses. .

   Large mouth bass can usually be found around structures. Such as logs
   submerged in the water, or rocks. The largemouth is known to be one of
   the best "fighters" and a ferocious predator attacking just about
   anything that moves. Largemouth have even been know to eat ducklings
   and baby alligators. The world record largemouth bass was caught near
   Jacksonville, Georgia on June 2, 1932 by George Perry. It weighed 22
   pounds 4 ounces and was caught from an oxbow lake off the Ocmulgee
   River called Montgomery Lake. This is one of the most sough-after
   records in the fishing world.

     * The Australian bass, Macquaria novemaculeata, a member of the perch
       family, Percichthyidae.
