   Pandanus is a large genus of between 600-700 species of tree- or
   shrub-like flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. The genus is
   native to the Old World tropics and western Pacific Ocean islands, with
   the largest number of species in Madagascar and Malesia (Wagner,
   Herbst, & Sohmer 1990). They are typically found in lower forested
   areas, savanahs, and along wetter shoreline regions. They are sometimes
   called screwpines because their long, flat leaves grow in a spiral
   pattern.

   They vary in size from small shrubs less than 1 m tall, up to
   medium-sized trees 20 m tall, typically with a broad canopy and
   moderate growth rate. The trunk is stout, wide-branching, and ringed
   with many leaf scars. They commonly have many thick prop roots near the
   base, which provide support as the tree grows top-heavy with leaves,
   fruit, and branches. The leaves are strap-shaped, varying between
   species from 30 cm up to 2 m or more long, and from 1.5 cm up to 10 cm
   broad.

   They are dioecious, with male and female flowers produced on different
   plants. The flowers of the male tree are 2-3 cm long and fragrant,
   surrounded by narrow, white bracts. The female tree produces flowers
   with round fruits that are also bract-surrounded. The fruits are
   globose, 10 to 20 cm in diameter, and have many prism-like sections,
   resembling the fruit of the pineapple. Typically, the fruit changes
   from green to bright orange or red as it matures. The fruit is edible.

Cultivation and uses

   Pandan ( P. amaryllifolius) leaves are used in Southeast Asian cooking
   to add a distinct aroma to rice and curry dishes such as nasi lemak,
   kaya preserves, and desserts such as pandan cake. They are known as
   daun pandan in Malay and 斑蘭 [bān lán] in Mandarin. Fresh leaves are
   typically torn into strips, tied in a knot to facilitate removal,
   placed in the cooking liquid, then removed at the end of cooking. Dried
   leaves and bottled extract may be bought in some places.

   In whole Oceania almost every part of the plant was used, with various
   species; different from that used in Southeast Asian cooking. Pandanus
   trees provided materials for housing, clothing and textiles, food,
   medication, decorations, fishing, and religious uses. Most important
   were, and still are, the mats which are handwoven from the dried
   leaves.

   Pandan is said to be a restorative, deodorant, indolent and phylatic,
   promoting a feeling of wellbeing and acting as a counter to tropical
   lasstitude. It may be chewed as a breath sweetener or used as a
   preservative on foods. It is also said to have flavonoids which are
   believed to have a variety of healthful properties, including
   antiviral, anti- allergen, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, and
   antioxidant.
