   Timothy Henry Henman, OBE (born 6 September 1974 in Oxford) is an
   English tennis player.

   He is the first player from the United Kingdom since Roger Taylor in
   the 1970s to reach the semi-finals of the Wimbledon Men's Singles
   Championship, and prior to the emergence of Andy Murray was regarded by
   his fans (whose devotion is known as "Henmania") as the UK's only hope
   of winning the tournament, a feat last achieved by Fred Perry in 1936.

Early life

   Henman was educated at Dragon School and Reed's School. He comes from a
   sporting family: his father was accomplished at various sports,
   including tennis. His grandfather and great-grandfather also competed
   at Wimbledon. Henman supports Oxford United Football Club and is a keen
   golfer.

   Between the ages of 10 and 17 he was a member of the David Lloyd Slater
   Squad, where he trained alongside a number of other young British
   tennis hopefuls. Henman won many titles at many different places some
   as smaller places as Ilkleys tennis club

   While still at school, Henman was diagnosed with osteochondritis, a
   bone disease (one form of chondritis). However, he kept playing tennis,
   and in 1992 won the National Junior titles in singles and doubles,
   deciding to join the professional tour in 1993.

Professional career

   He climbed up the ranks very quickly: in 1994, he was among the top 200
   players in the world; by 1995, among the top 100; and by 1996, he had
   made it into the top 30 and won a medal at the Atlanta Olympics. He was
   the UK's highest ranked player that year, and won the Most Improved
   Player trophy at the ATP awards. He was subsequently elected to the ATP
   Tour Player Council and went on to win his first championship in
   January 1997. In March of that year, he underwent surgery on his elbow
   which kept him out of action for two months.

   In 1998, the year in which he reached Wimbledon's semi-finals for the
   first time, he was ranked as one of the top 10 ATP players. In 1999,
   Henman married his long-term girlfriend, TV producer Lucy Heald.

   "Tiger Tim" - as he is known to the British tabloids and Wimbledon
   diehards (many of whom assemble on Henman Hill, unofficially named for
   their hero) - has come close to reaching the final on a number of
   occasions, bowing out during the semi-final in 1998, 1999, 2001 (when
   just two points from victory at one point) and 2002. In 2000 he reached
   the fourth round and in 1996, 1997, 2003 and 2004 he was ousted during
   the quarter-finals.

   One of the tournaments he has been most successful in is Queen's Club.
   He reached the final in 1999, where he lost to Pete Sampras, and went
   on to reach the final again in 2001 and 2002, where both times he lost
   to Lleyton Hewitt.

   2001 was Tim's best Wimbledon year. He beat Roger Federer in 4 sets
   during the quarterfinal and gained a lot of confidence coming into the
   semis since the latter just took out defending champion Pete Sampras.
   Tim faced three-time finalist Goran Ivanišević, who was likewise
   seeking his first Wimbledon victory. Goran took the first set 7-5 after
   breaking Tim's serve with a return winner. Henman took the second after
   a tight tiebreak that seemed Ivanišević's way from the start. The
   latter gave in at the third, losing 0-6. The odds were for Henman then
   on, but rain came early in the fourth set that suspended the match and
   enabled his opponent to recover. When play resumed, the set went on
   until Goran took the tiebreak. Rain came again in the middle of the
   fifth set. Henman netted a handful of easy volleys during one of his
   service games, giving Ivanišević the break. There was no looking back.
   Ivanišević won the decider 6-3 and went on to win the title.

   In 2003 he finally took his first ATP Masters Series title, winning in
   Paris against Andrei Pavel. Better still, he beat Roger Federer and
   Andy Roddick on his way to the final.

   Until 2004, Henman had never progressed beyond the fourth round of any
   grand slam except Wimbledon. However, he finally won a fourth round
   match at the French Open at the 2004 championships. His run finally
   came to an end in the semifinals, where he was beaten by tournament
   favorite and runner-up Guillermo Coria after winning the first set, the
   first that the Argentine had lost during the championships. Henman then
   continued his form and reached the quaterfinals of Wimbledon. Later
   that year, he added another grand slam semifinal appearence a few
   months later, at the US Open, losing to eventual champion Roger
   Federer. Finally, at the end of year he qualified for the year-end
   Tennis Masters Cup.

   .

   In the 2004 Summer Olympics tennis event, Henman was seeded fourth and
   expected to do well, but lost in the first round.

   In 2005, he lost in straight sets to Nikolay Davydenko in the third
   round of the Australian Open. This was considered a great
   disappointment, given his improved results at Grand Slams in the
   previous year. He went out in the second round at both the French Open
   and Wimbledon. In France, he lost in four sets to Luis Horna. At
   Wimbledon, he lost in five sets to Dmitry Tursunov after being 2-1 up;
   he narrowly won his first round match also in five sets, having been
   2-0 down. At the US Open he lost in straight sets in the first round to
   Fernando Verdasco.

   Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against Lleyton Hewitt on
   March 25th 2006, with a 7-6 6-3 victory at the Nasdaq-100 event in
   Miami. The outcome was totally unexpected, but the Australian #1 didn't
   look very good during the entire match. However, 3 months later at 2006
   The Stella Artois Championships Jun 12-Jun 18, Henman lost to Lleyton
   Hewitt 3-6, 6-3, 2-6 in the semifinals and also lost to Roger Federer
   at Wimbledon 2006 in the 2nd round.

   Henman has recently stated in the media that he has no plans to retire
   in the near future, although he has yet to reach a Grand Slam final and
   his results in recent years have shown a reversal seeing him slip down
   the rankings to 62 leading to him being unseeded at Wimbledon for the
   first time in a number of years. At the 2006 Wimbledon championships,
   he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 4-6, 0-6,
   2-6, after a five-set victory over Robin Soderling of Sweden in the
   first round. Of late Henman has experienced improved results with his
   world ranking rising to 39. However, he continues to suffer from injury
   problems.

   Henman was created an OBE in the 2003 New Year's Honours List.

   In late 2006, Henman finally reached his first final since 2004 (
   Indian Wells) at the AIG Open, losing to Roger Federer 3-6 3-6.

   Henman was forced to withdraw from the Australian open in 2007 because
   of a hamstring injury. He returned in time to enter Masters Series
   Events in Indian Wells Masters and Miami Masters but lost in the first
   round in both of them.

          Series Events - as they are variously referred to, are a group
          of tournaments with more prestige than normal tour events, but
          less importance than the Grand Slams.
