   William ("Willie") Charles Renshaw (born January 3, 1861 in Leamington,
   Warwickshire â€“ died August 12, 1904 in Swanage, Dorset) was one of the
   greatest British male tennis players of all time.

   He won fourteen Wimbledon titles: seven in singles (an all-time record
   he now shares with Pete Sampras) and seven in doubles, partnering with
   his twin brother Ernest Renshaw. In 1983, Renshaw was elected into the
   International Tennis Hall of Fame.
