The Beatles discography

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Musical Recordings and
compositions

   The Beatles released twelve albums (thirteen if The White Album is
   counted twice) in seven years. Their discography is complicated due to
   different U.S. and UK releases, particularly in their early years at
   Capitol.

Historical background

   The first four Beatles vinyl albums differ based on their location of
   release. Those released in the U.S. were of lower sound quality and had
   some of their songs omitted. Additionally, even though the first four
   Beatles albums were originally released as both monaural and stereo
   recordings in the United Kingdom, stereo record players were quite rare
   in the UK at the time. Naturally, then, George Martin and The Beatles
   only spent a lot of time on the mono mixes. Many early songs were later
   remastered by Capitol Records for the U.S. as artificial stereo with
   bass on one side and treble on the other side, with lots of added echo.
   However, this was only done when the stereo mix of the song was not
   available or did not exist, as in the case of She Loves You. The
   Capitol release of Rubber Soul, however, has gained a lot of fans in
   the years since the release of the British albums on CD. The additions
   of "I've Just Seen a Face" and "It's Only Love" from "Help!" and the
   omission of "Drive my Car," "Nowhere Man," "What Goes On," and "If I
   Needed Someone" gives the album a different, folky flavour.

   When it came time to release The Beatles' catalogue on CD, the decision
   was made to use the original British versions of the albums, since
   those were the "way The Beatles originally intended them to be". The
   initial releases of the first four CDs were of the original mono mixes.
   In 2004, Capitol Records released the first four American albums on CD
   as a box set and they represent the current (as of 2006) official
   stereo versions. No official stereo mix of the first four British
   albums had been released on compact disc, but there were plenty of
   "official looking" bootleg CDs in circulation that include the U.S.
   stereo mixes and even bear the " Apple" logo. Martin and The Beatles
   started to spend more time on stereo mixes by 1965. However, many fans
   believe that the mono versions of Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
   Club Band, and the so-called White Album are superior to the stereo
   mixes.

   As of 2006, many Beatles enthusiasts feel that the current EMI CD
   releases of the albums do not do them justice. The music was mastered
   to be played on vinyl, the cutting and playback of which is widely
   believed to add 'warmth' to the recording, and the CDs, produced during
   the early days of the format, do not compensate for the different
   medium. Given how important the sound quality of these albums was not
   only to The Beatles and George Martin, but also from a historical point
   of view, many purists still listen to The Beatles albums only on vinyl.

In Canada

   The division of Capitol Records in Canada released three albums and a
   number of singles in 1963 and 1964 before aligning with the American
   division and releasing the same albums as in the U.S. Unlike the U.S.,
   Capitol of Canada said yes to The Beatles from day one, as many British
   artists had obtained hit records in Canada previously, unlike in the
   USA. The first Canadian release was " Love Me Do" on 1963- 02-04.

     * Twist and Shout, Capitol Canada ( 1964- 02-03)
     * The Beatles' Long Tall Sally, Capitol Canada ( 1964- 05-11)

In the U.S.

   In the United States, as noted above, The Beatles albums were
   rearranged, retitled and remixed. Some of the U.S. releases were nearly
   identical to their UK counterparts, often only varying by one or two
   songs. Most releases contained songs that were also found on other
   records, which made things difficult for the American Beatles fan
   trying to purchase the band's entire catalog. By 1967, all U.S.
   releases matched the UK releases exactly. Some of the U.S. releases
   included:

Singles

          Superscripted numbers indicate the peak position in the charts.
          The UK Singles Chart is compiled solely from sales figures;
          airplay statistics are not used. For this reason the chart
          positions for the UK Singles are indicated per disc, not per
          song.
          The Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S. is compiled from sales
          and airplay statistics, so the individual songs on any given
          disc can be charted separately.
