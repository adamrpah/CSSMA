   As a means of recording the passage of time, the 10th century was that
   century which lasted from 901 to 1000.

Overview

   The tenth century is usually regarded as a low point in European
   history. In China it was also a period of political upheaval. In
   Islamdom, however, it was a cultural zenith, especially in Spain.

   Medievalist and historian of technology Lynn White said that "to the
   modern eye, it is very nearly the darkest of the Dark Ages," but
   concluded that ". . . if it was dark, it was the darkness of the womb."
   Similarly, Helen Waddell wrote that the tenth century was that which
   "in the textbooks disputes with the seventh the bad eminence, the nadir
   of the human intellect." Even in the fifteenth century, Lorenzo Valla
   described it as the Century of Lead and Iron.
