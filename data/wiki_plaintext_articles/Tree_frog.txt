   Tree frogs are frogs of the family Hylidae. There is large variation
   within the tree frogs. Many of the arboreal frogs are green in colour,
   whereas the terrestrial and aquatic species are duller. They mostly
   feed on insects, however some of the larger species can feed on small
   vertebrates. Many of the tree frogs are not arboreal, and can be
   terrestrial or aquatic. The species within the genus Cyclorana are
   burrowing frogs, sometimes spending many years underground.

Types of tree frog

   The European tree frogs such as Hyla arborea are common in the middle
   and south of the continent, and range into Asia and the north of
   Africa. The species become very noisy on the approach of rain, and are
   sometimes kept in confinement as a kind of barometer.

   In North America there are many species of tree frog, including Hyla
   versicolor, a species of grey treefrog, and Hyla cinerea, the green
   tree frog. The spring peeper is also widespread in the eastern United
   States and commonly heard on summer and spring evenings.

   The tree toad is a popular name for several of the Hylidae. Hyla
   versicolor is the changeable tree toad, Trachycephalus lichenatus is
   the lichened, and T. marmoratus the marbled tree toad.
