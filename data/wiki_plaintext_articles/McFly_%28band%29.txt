   McFly are an English pop rock band who were successfully launched into
   the music scene in early 2004 with their number one single, " 5 Colours
   in Her Hair". The band was founded by Tom Fletcher (born July 17, 1985)
   and also consists of Danny Jones (born March 12, 1986), Dougie Poynter
   (born November 30, 1987) and Harry Judd (born December 23, 1985). They
   are signed to the Island Records label and are managed by Prestige
   Management.

   As of December 2006, McFly have had eleven top ten singles, six of
   which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and two number one
   albums, their debut being Room on the 3rd Floor followed by Wonderland.
   Their third album, Motion in the Ocean, was released on November 6,
   2006 and charted at number six. An announcement was made on their
   MySpace page in April 2007 that the band would be releasing a Greatest
   Hits so Far compilation in November 2007, and a fourth studio album in
   March 2008.

History

Early years

   McFly's name was chosen by Fletcher, the band's founding member, based
   on his love for the American science-fiction comedy Back to the Future,
   films and Michael J. Fox's character Marty McFly. Fletcher had
   originally auditioned for Busted, but was rejected. He then started
   writing songs with Busted member James Bourne and was asked to come
   along to film auditions for a new band, V. Jones came along to the
   audition mistaking it for an audition for a Busted-like band. Fletcher
   spoke to Jones afterwards and Jones and Fletcher moved into the
   intercontinental hotel in london for 2 months, and the two began
   writing songs along with Bourne. To complete the band, they held
   auditions at London's Covent Garden for a drummer and a bass player.
   Coincidentally, Poynter and Judd both auditioned on the same day. Thus,
   McFly was formed.

Room on the 3rd Floor

   McFly's early sound was a mixture of pop and punk. Their debut single,
   " 5 Colours in Her Hair", released March 29, 2004, entered the UK
   Singles Chart at number one in April 2004 and stayed there for two
   weeks. In July 2004 their second single, " Obviously", also topped the
   charts. This was followed by the album Room on the 3rd Floor debuting
   at number one in the UK Albums Chart. The album broke records, as McFly
   were the youngest band to have a debut album enter the charts in the
   top position, beating The Beatles. The third single, " That Girl", was
   released on September 6, 2004 and lost the battle for the top spot to
   Brian McFadden's " Real To Me". It went to number three, despite
   topping midweek sales charts. The fourth single, Room on the 3rd Floor
   (the album's title track), was released on November 15, 2004 and made
   number five. The idea for the album name "Room on the Third Floor" came
   from where Danny and Tom wrote most of the songs for the album. They
   wrote them while staying in a room on the third floor. This also gave
   them the idea for the song "Room on the Third Floor"

Wonderland

   In March 2005, McFly released " All About You/You've Got a Friend", a
   double A-side of their sixth and seventh singles and the first release
   from their second album, Wonderland, which features a 60-piece
   orchestra. The single reached number one for a week on March 13, 2005
   and the profits from the single were donated to Comic Relief. The video
   for "You've Got a Friend" was shot in Uganda, Africa, which McFly
   visited for the charity appeal. They completed their first arena tour
   in October 2005. The second single from Wonderland, " I'll Be OK", was
   released in the UK on the 15 August 2005 and scored them their fourth
   UK number one. The album itself was released on 29 August 2005 entering
   at number one. The third single from Wonderland, " I Wanna Hold You",
   was released October 17, giving them their sixth top three single,
   missing out on number one to the Arctic Monkeys. Their fourth single, "
   Ultraviolet/The Ballad of Paul K" was released on 12 December 2005 and
   reached number nine.

Motion in the Ocean

   The first single from Motion in the Ocean was named, " Please, Please",
   released in the UK as a double A-side with the Queen hit " Don't Stop
   Me Now" on July 17, 2006 as the official song for Sport Relief 2006.
   The double A-side reached number one in the UK charts on July 23, 2006
   making it the band's fifth number one single of their career. After
   losing a bet to the owner of G-A-Y, McFly had to appear naked on stage
   as they did in their "Please, Please" video. On 14 September 2006, it
   was confirmed via an email newsletter from McFly's official website,
   that the third album would be called Motion in the Ocean. The album was
   released on November 6, 2006, and reached number 6. The second release
   from the album, " Star Girl" was released on October 23, 2006, to
   promote the album. "Star Girl" reached number one in its first week
   with 54,802 copies sold. The third release from the album, " Sorry's
   Not Good Enough/Friday Night", was released on December 18, 2006, and
   reached number three in the UK singles charts. "Friday Night" is
   featured in the movie Night at the Museum, which was released on
   December 22, 2006, in Canada and the US and December 26, 2006, in the
   UK.. Their next single, Baby's Coming Back/Transylvania, was released
   on the 7th May 2007. The original single release date was due to be
   February 26th, but the band took up the offer to return at that time to
   the town of Kamwokya in Uganda, which they previously visited for Comic
   Relief 2005.

   'Motion In The Ocean, Mcfly's third album will be re-released as double
   disc edition with the new song 'Baby's coming back' and DVD from the

Musical style

   McFly's style has been dubbed by themselves and others in the music
   business as "Nu-Pop" but is possibly more commonly considered pop or
   pop rock. Despite the band's pop image and reputation, there are
   musical differences from other contemporary boybands. Influence is
   apparent from bands such as The Raspberries (particularly Eric
   Carmen-penned material), The Beach Boys, and The Beatles (particularly
   Paul McCartney-penned material). Lyrically, however, their style is
   closer, though not quite similar, to other contemporary guitar pop
   bands such as Busted . McFly are often considered similar in style to
   the now defunct Busted, with whom they shared a record label and were
   generally considered to be friends. Indeed, James Bourne of Busted and
   Son of Dork, has had a hand in writing several of McFly's biggest hits,
   and Tom Fletcher had also written tracks for bands James Bourne has
   been involved with including Busted's hit single 'Crashed the Wedding'.
   However, though similar, Busted evidence greater influence from pop
   punk bands such as Blink 182 and Sum 41 than 1960s rock, in addition to
   their clear pop overtones.

Cover songs

   McFly have recorded and performed a variety of officially released and
   unreleased cover versions of well-known songs.
