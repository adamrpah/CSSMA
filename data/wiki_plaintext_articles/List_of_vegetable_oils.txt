   The list of vegetable oils includes all vegetable oils that are
   extracted from plants by placing the relevant part of the plant under
   pressure, to squeeze the oil out. Although few plants are entirely
   without oil, the oil from a small set of major oil crops complemented
   by a few dozen minor oil crops has become widely used and traded.

   Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in
   water or another solvent, and distilling the oil (known as essential
   oils), or by infusing parts of plants in a base oil (a process known as
   maceration; see list of macerated oils). The distilled essential oils
   often have quite different properties and uses to vegetable oils, and
   are listed in the list of essential oils.

   Vegetable oils can be classified in several ways, for example:
     * By source: most, but not all vegetable oils are extracted from the
       fruits or seeds of plants, and the oils may be classified by
       grouping oils from similar plants, such as "nut oils".
     * By use: oils from plants are used in cooking, for fuel, for
       cosmetics, for medical purposes, and for other industrial purposes.

   The vegetable oils are grouped below in common classes of use.

Edible oils

Major oils

   Sunflowers are the source of Sunflower oil.

   These oils account for a significant fraction of world-wide edible oil
   production. All are also used as fuel oils.
     * Coconut oil, a cooking oil, high in saturated fat, particularly
       used in baking and cosmetics.
     * Corn oil, a common cooking oil with little odour or taste.
     * Cottonseed oil, used in manufacturing potato chips and other snack
       foods. Very low in trans-fats.
     * Canola oil (a variety of rapeseed oil), one of the most widely used
       cooking oils, from a (trademarked) cultivar of rapeseed.
     * Olive oil, used in cooking, cosmetics, soaps, and as a fuel for
       traditional oil lamps.
     * Palm oil, the most widely produced tropical oil. Also used to make
       biofuel.
     * Peanut oil (Ground nut oil), a clear oil used for dressing salads
       and, due to its high smoke point, especially used for frying.
     * Safflower oil, produced for export for over 50 years, first for use
       in paint industry, now mostly as a cooking oil.
     * Sesame oil, cold pressed as light cooking oil, hot pressed for a
       darker and stronger flavor.
     * Soybean oil, produced as a byproduct of processing soy meal.
     * Sunflower oil, a common cooking oil, also used to make biodiesel.

Nut oils

   Nut oils are generally used in cooking, for their flavor. They are also
   quite costly, because of the difficulty of extracting the oil.
     * Almond oil, used as an edible oil, but primarily in the manufacture
       of pharmaceuticals.
     * Cashew oil, somewhat comparable to olive oil. May have value for
       fighting dental cavities.
     * Hazelnut oil, mainly used for its flavor. Also used in skin care,
       because of its slight astringent nature.
     * Macadamia oil, strongly flavored, contains no trans-fats, and a
       good balance of omega-3 and omega-6.
     * Pecan oil, valued as a food oil, but requiring fresh pecans for
       good quality oil.
     * Pistachio oil, strongly flavored oil, particularly for use in
       salads.
     * Walnut oil, used for its flavor, also used by Renaissance painters
       in oil paints.

Food supplements

   A number of oils are used as food supplements, for their nutrient
   content or medical effect.
     * Acai oil, from the fruit of several species of the Açaí Palm
       (Euterpe). Grown in the Amazon region. Similar to grape seed oil.
       Used in cosmetics and as a food supplement.
     * Blackcurrant seed oil, used as a food supplement, because of high
       content of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.
     * Borage seed oil, similar to blackcurrant seed oil, used primarily
       medicinally.
     * Evening primrose oil, used as a food supplement for its purported

Oils used for biofuel

   A number of the oils listed above are used for biofuel (biodiesel and
   Straight Vegetable Oil) in addition to having other uses. A number of
   oils are used only as biofuel.

   Although diesel engines were invented, in part, with vegetable oil in
   mind, diesel fuel is almost exclusively petroleum-based. Rising oil
   prices have made biodiesel more attractive. Vegetable oils are
   evaluated for use as a biofuel based on:
    1. Suitability as a fuel, based on flash point, energy content,
       viscosity, combustion products and other factors
    2. Cost, based in part on yield, effort required to grow and harvest,
       and post-harvest processing cost

Inedible oils used only or primarily as biofuel

   These oils are extracted from plants that are cultivated solely for
   producing oil-based biofuel. These, plus the major oils described
   above, have received much more attention as fuel oils than other plant
   oils.
     * Algae oil, recently developed by MIT scientist Isaac Berzin.
       Byproduct of a smokestack emission reduction system.
     * Copaiba, an oleoresin tapped from species of genus Copaifera. Used
       in Brazil as a major source of biodiesel.
     * Honge oil, pioneered as a biofuel by Udipi Shrinivasa in Bangalore,
       India.
     * Jatropha oil, widely used in India as a fuel oil. Has attracted
       strong proponents for use as a biofuel.
     * Jojoba oil, from the Simmondsia chinensis, a desert shrub.
     * Milk bush, popularized by chemist Melvin Calvin in the 1950s.
       Researched in the 1980s by PetroBras, the Brazilian national
       petroleum company.
     * Petroleum nut oil, from the Petroleum nut native to the
       Philippines. The Philippine government once explored the use of the
       petroleum nut as a biofuel.

Drying oils

   Drying oils are vegetable oils that dry to a hard finish at normal
   temperatures. Such oils are used as the basis of oil paints, and in
   other paint and wood finishing applications. In addition to the oils
   listed here, walnut, sunflower and safflower oil are also considered to
   be drying oils.
     * Dammar oil, from the Canarium strictum, used in paint as a drying
       agent. Can also be used as in oil lamps.

       sebiferum. Used as a drying agent in paints and varnishes.
     * Tung oil, used in wood finishing.

       industrial coatings.
