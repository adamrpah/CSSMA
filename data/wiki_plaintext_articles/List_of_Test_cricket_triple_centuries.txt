   Australian Donald Bradman is one of only two players in the history of
   cricket to have scored 300 or more runs in a single Test match innings
   on more than one occasion. The other is Brian Lara of the West Indies.

   This list of Test cricket triple centuries shows all instances where a
   batsman has scored 300 runs or more in a single innings in Test
   cricket, a feat achieved on 21 occasions by 19 different batsmen from
   six of the ten Test-cricket playing nations. No player from Bangladesh,
   New Zealand, South Africa or Zimbabwe has ever scored 300, although
   Martin Crowe of New Zealand was once dismissed for 299 in a match
   against Sri Lanka in 1991.

   The first Test triple century was achieved by Andy Sandham of England
   against West Indies in 1930, and the most recent was scored by Mahela
   Jayawardene of Sri Lanka against South Africa in 2006. The probability
   of a batsman scoring a Test triple century is comparable to that of a
   bowler taking a Test hat-trick.

   Brian Lara of the West Indies and Donald Bradman of Australia are the
   only batsmen to reach 300 more than once. Bradman also scored 299 not
   out against South Africa in 1932. Lara's 400 not out against England in
   2004, his second Test triple-century, is the highest score in Test
   cricket and the only instance of a Test quadruple century.
