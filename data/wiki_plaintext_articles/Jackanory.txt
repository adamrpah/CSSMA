Jackanory

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Television

   Jackanory is a long-running BBC children's television series that was
   designed to stimulate an interest in reading. It began on 13 December
   1965, the first story being the fairy-tale Cap o' Rushes read by Lee
   Montague, it was believed that the last ever episode was on 24 March
   1996, clocking up around 3,500 episodes in that time, but the series
   returned on 27 November 2006.

   The show's format, which hardly varied over the decades, involved an
   actor reading from famous children's novels or folk tales while seated
   in an armchair, although later episodes took the radical step of
   allowing the presenters to stand up. From time to time the scene being
   read would be illustrated by a specially-commissioned still drawing,
   often by Quentin Blake. Usually a single book would occupy five daily
   fifteen-minute episodes, from Monday to Friday. A few Jackanory stories
   took the form of a play rather than stories being read, in a series of
   30-minute fully-cast and costumed dramas entitled Jackanory Playhouse.
   These included a dramatisation by Philip Glassborow of the comical A A
   Milne story, "The Princess Who Couldn't Laugh."

Origin of title

   The show's title comes from an old English nursery rhyme:

          I'll tell you a story
          about Jack-a-nory;
          and now my story's begun.
          I'll tell you another
          'bout Jack and his brother;
          and now my story is done.

Revival

   In November 2006 Jackanory returned with comedian John Sessions as the
   revived programme's first narrator reading The Lord of the Rings parody
   Muddle Earth, written by Chris Riddell and Paul Stewart. The second
   narrator was Sir Ben Kingsley, reading The Magician of Samarkand by
   Alan Temperley. They were broadcast in three 15 minute slots on CBBC
   and BBC One and later repeated entire on BBC One on consecutive Sundays
   The readings of Muddle Earth were heavily accompanied by animation and
   featured actors speaking lines, leading to criticism that the spirit of
   the original programme, a single voice telling a tale with minimum
   distraction, had been lost. (The Magician of Samarkand was a similar
   production, although without the actors speaking lines.)

   Rather than a series of books taking a particular time slot
   consecutively for a number of weeks in the year, it is envisaged that
   new readings will be dropped into the schedule as specials from time to
   time at irregular intervals.

   CBeebies will run a series of Jackanory Juniors daily .
