   Tropical Storm Harvey was a strong tropical storm over the western
   Atlantic Ocean during August in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.
   Harvey was the eighth named storm of the record-breaking season.

   Tropical Storm Harvey formed from a tropical wave to the southwest of
   Bermuda on August 2 and passed close to Bermuda on August 4, bringing
   heavy rain to the island. After it moved east away from Bermuda, Harvey
   reached its peak strength before the storm turned to the northeast.
   Harvey became a strong extratropical storm on August 8 and the system
   survived for a few more days in the central Atlantic.

Storm history

   Storm path

   A tropical wave left the African coast on July 22 and crossed over the
   Atlantic without any development occurring. When the wave approached
   the Leeward Islands on July 28, the National Hurricane Centre monitored
   the system closely for any possible development, which did not occur at
   that time. By August 2, conditions had become more favorable and
   Tropical Depression Eight formed about 350 miles (595 km) southwest of
   Bermuda. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey the
   next day. High initial levels of wind shear gave Harvey some
   subtropical characteristics and also caused the official forecasts to
   underestimate the future strength of the storm.

   Harvey passed 45 miles (75 km) south of Bermuda early on August 4, with
   winds of 60 mph (90 km/h), before shedding its subtropical
   characteristics to become a "fully tropical" storm. As it moved
   northeast away from the island, the storm strengthened further to its
   peak with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Unexpectedly, increased wind
   shear did not cause Harvey to weaken significantly, although the
   storm's motion did become erratic. Harvey became a strong extratropical
   storm during the night on August 8 and survived another few days before
   dissipating northwest of the Azores on August 14.

Impact

   As Tropical Storm Harvey approached Bermuda a tropical storm warning
   was issued late on August 2 and due to the outside possibility of
   further strengthening to hurricane strength a hurricane watch was
   issued 24 hours later. As the storm moved away from Bermuda on August
   4, first the hurricane watch and then the tropical storm warning were
   cancelled.

   Harvey brought heavy rain to Bermuda, with just over 5 inches (130 mm)
   reported at Bermuda International Airport and caused some flooding of
   roads. In addition, there was a report of sustained winds of
   approximately 45 mph (75 km/h) on the island. The storm was not
   responsible for any fatalities or damages on the island.

Naming and Records

   When Tropical Storm Harvey formed on August 3, it was the earliest ever
   in a season that the eighth tropical storm formed, beating the previous
   record held by Hurricane Eight of the 1936 season by 12 days. This was
   the fourth time that the name Harvey had been used to name a tropical
   cyclone in the Atlantic and the sixth time worldwide. Due to the lack
   of any major effects from Tropical Storm Harvey, the name was not
   retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on the
   list of names for the 2011 Season.
