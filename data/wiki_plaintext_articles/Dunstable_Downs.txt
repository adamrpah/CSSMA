   Dunstable Downs are part of the Chiltern Hills, in southern
   Bedfordshire in England. They are a chalk escarpment forming the
   north-eastern reaches of the Chilterns. At 243 m (797 ft), Dunstable
   Downs are the highest point of Bedfordshire.

   Because of its elevation, Dunstable Downs hosted a station in the
   shutter telegraph chain which connected the Admiralty in London to its
   naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth during the years 1808 to
   1814.

   Whipsnade Zoo has cut an enormous lion shape into the chalk into the
   side of one of the hills. The lion can be seen from the Aylesbury to
   Dunstable road.

   The downs are used by gliders, kite fliers, hang gliders and
   paragliders in the area because of their height. The London Gliding
   Club is based at the foot of the downs.

   Much of the downs are managed by the National Trust as part of the
   Dunstable Downs, Countryside Centre & Whipsnade Estate property, and
   the downs are also home to a wide variety of wildlife including many
   rare wild flowers, such as the Bee Orchid, and different butterfly
   species, like the Marbled White and the Chalkhill Blue.
