   Darmstadtium ( IPA: /ˌdɑːmˈʃtatiəm/), formerly called ununnilium ( IPA:
   /ˌjuːnuːˈnɪliəm/, symbol Uun) or eka-platinum, is a chemical element
   with the symbol Ds and atomic number 110. It is one of the so-called
   super-heavy atoms. This synthetic element quickly decays: its isotopes
   of mass 267 to 273 have half-lives measured in microseconds. Heavier
   isotopes, of mass 279 and 281, have been subsequently synthesized and
   are more stable, with half-lives of 180 milliseconds and 11.1 seconds,
   respectively.

History

   Ds was first generated on November 9, 1994 at the Gesellschaft für
   Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany by a team headed by
   Dr. Jorge Rigol. Only a few atoms of it were prepared by nuclear
   fusion, involving bombarding a lead target with nickel:

          {208 \atop 82}\mathrm{Pb}+{62 \atop
          28}\mathrm{Ni}\quad\rightarrow\quad{269 \atop 110}\mathrm{Ds}+{1
          \atop 0}\mathrm{n} \;

   The element was named after the place of its discovery, Darmstadt (the
   GSI is located in Wixhausen, a northern portion of the city). The new
   name was given to it by the IUPAC on August 16, 2003.

Trivia

   Some suggested (for fun) the name policium for the new element, because
   110 is the emergency telephone number for the German police.
