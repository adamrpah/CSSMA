   Seaborgium ( IPA: /ˌsiːˈbɔː(r)giəm/), also called eka-tungsten, is a
   chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Sg and
   atomic number 106. Seaborgium is a synthetic element whose most stable
   isotope ^271Sg has a half-life of 2.4 minutes. Its chemistry resembles
   that of tungsten.

History

   Element 106 was discovered almost simultaneously by two different
   laboratories. In June 1974, an American research team led by Albert
   Ghiorso at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at the University of
   California, Berkeley reported creating an isotope with mass number 263
   and a half-life of 1.0 s, and in September 1974, a Soviet team led by
   G. N. Flerov at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna
   reported producing an isotope with mass number 259 and a half-life of
   0.48 s,

   Because their work was independently confirmed first, the Americans
   suggested the name seaborgium to honour the American chemist Glenn T.
   Seaborg credited as a member of the American team along with Ghiorso,
   J.M. Nitschke, J.R. Alonso, C.T. Alonso, M. Nurmia, E. Kenneth Hulet,
   and R.W. Lougheed in recognition of his participation in the discovery
   of several other actinides. The name selected by the team became
   controversial. An international committee decided in 1992 that the
   Berkeley and Dubna laboratories should share credit for the discovery.

   An element naming controversy erupted and as a result IUPAC adopted
   unnilhexium ( IPA: /ˌjuːnɪlˈhɛksiəm/, symbol Unh) as a temporary,
   systematic element name. In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that
   element 106 be named rutherfordium and adopted a rule that no element
   can be named after a living person. This ruling was fiercely objected
   to by the American Chemical Society. Critics pointed out that a
   precedent had been set in the naming of einsteinium during Albert
   Einstein's life. In 1997, as part of a compromise involving elements
   104 to 108, the name seaborgium for element 106 was recognized
   internationally.

Isotopes

   There are 12 known isotopes of Seaborgium, the longest-lived of which
   is ^271Sg which decays through alpha decay and spontaneous fission. It
   has a half-life of 2.4 minutes. The shortest-lived isotope is ^258Sg
   which also decays through alpha decay and spontaneous fission. It has a
   half-life of 2.9 ms.
