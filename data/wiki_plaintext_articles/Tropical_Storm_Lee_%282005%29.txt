   Part of the
   2005 Atlantic hurricane season

   Tropical Storm Lee was a weak storm in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane
   season that briefly reached tropical storm strength late in August over
   the central Atlantic. It was the twelfth named storm of the season and
   spent much of its lifespan as a tropical depression or as a remnant
   low.

   Tropical Storm Lee initially formed east of the Lesser Antilles as a
   tropical depression on August 28, before degenerating into a remnant
   low the next day. The low moved north and briefly achieved tropical
   storm status on August 31, as it moved around a non-tropical system,
   the presence of which complicated forecasts. Tropical Storm Lee
   degenerated back into a remnant low on September 2 and was then
   absorbed by a cold front. During its brief existence Tropical Storm Lee
   never threatened any land.

Storm history

   Storm path

   A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 24. It
   developed into an area of low pressure area as it crossed the Atlantic,
   and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on August 28 while 960
   mi (1550  km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Because of northeasterly
   shear, the centre of the circulation was removed from the convection,
   and the depression degenerated into a remnant low late on August 29.
   Many of the models had indicated that this was likely, but the National
   Hurricane Centre (NHC) instead chose to forecast slight strengthening.

   The remnant low moved northwards, then turned to the northeast due to
   the effects of a non-tropical system. As it moved to the northeast, the
   activity in the remnant low increased again and the depression
   regenerated on August 31. That afternoon, the depression strengthened
   further into Tropical Storm Lee, reaching its peak intensity with winds
   of 40 mph (65 km/h), in between Bermuda and the Azores. As quoted by
   NHC forecaster Dr. Lixion Avila, "There is an uncertainty in the
   intensity of the tropical cyclone at this time". This uncertainty was
   shown by the NHC operationally downgrading the storm to a depression
   after just 6 hours, when in post-season analysis it was found to have
   lasted twice as long. Lee weakened again into a tropical depression as
   it continued to move around the non-tropical low to its west. The
   presence of this low made Lee difficult to forecast, and as the two
   systems began to merge on September 1, it resulted in uncertainty
   relating to what degree the system remained tropical. Later that day,
   shear again removed the convection of the depression, and Lee became a
   remnant low which survived until September 4 when it was absorbed by a
   cold front.

Impact

   Tropical Storm Lee did not affect any land areas and there were no
   reports of damage or fatalities. Because Lee stayed well out to sea, no
   warnings or watches were issued.

Naming and records

   When Tropical Storm Lee was formed on August 31, it was the second
   earliest occurrence in a season for the development of the 12th named
   tropical storm, 2 days after the record held by Hurricane Luis of the
   1995 season. This made it one of the few storms of the 2005 Atlantic
   hurricane season to not hold a record for the earliest formation of the
   nth storm. Additionally, while this was the first use of Lee to name an
   Atlantic storm, following the retirement of Hurricane Lenny in 1999,
   Lee had previously been used to name 3 storms in the Western Pacific
   Ocean. Due to the lack of any effects from Tropical Storm Lee, the name
   was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on
   the list of names for the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season.
