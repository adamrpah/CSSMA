   2003 Atlantic hurricane season

   Tropical Storm Larry was the twelfth tropical storm in the 2003
   Atlantic hurricane season. It was one of eight storms to impact Mexico
   between the Atlantic Ocean in the season, a near-record. Larry formed
   in early October from an extratropical storm in the Bay of Campeche,
   and reached a peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h). Due to weak steering
   currents, the storm southward, resulting the storm to hit the Tabasco
   coastline, the first Tabascan landfall since Tropical Storm Brenda in
   1973.

   Larry drifted across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, dropping heavy
   rainfall of over nine inches in places. The rainfall led to flooding
   and mudslides, causing damage to thousands of houses. The flooding
   killed five people and resulted in $53.6 million (2003 USD, $59 million
   2005 USD) in damage. Larry was one of three tropical cyclones to hit
   Mexico in a short period of time, including Tropical Depression Nora
   and Tropical Storm Olaf in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

Storm history

   Storm path

   A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 17. It moved
   across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and
   remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on
   September 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper level
   anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper level outflow and for deep
   convection to develop. On the 27th, a low pressure area developed while
   the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the Yucatán
   Peninsula. The system continued to organize, and nearly developed into
   a tropical depression before moving ashore on the Yucatan Peninsula on
   September 29.

   Dry air and land weakened the tropical wave, and when the area entered
   the Bay of Campeche, it merged with a stationary frontal boundary.
   Cool, dry air around the system caused the system to develop a cold
   core, and the area organized into an extratropical low on September 30.
   A large high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico forced
   the system southward, where deep convection developed significant
   convection. The system developed a warm core, and on October 1 the
   storm organized into Tropical Storm Larry while located 300 miles
   east-southeast of Tampico, Mexico.

   Weak steering currents allowed for Larry to drift westward at 2 mph
   while marginally favorable conditions allowed the storm to strengthen
   to a peak of 65 mph on October 3. A mid-level ridge forced the storm
   more to the south-southeast, where after remaining a 60 mph storm for
   three days, Larry made landfall on Paraíso in the Mexican province of
   Tabasco on October 5. It steadily weakened over land, and degenerated
   into a remnant low on October 6 while mid-way through the Isthmus of
   Tehuantepec. The remnant low turned to the southwest, and reached the
   eastern Pacific Ocean on the 7th. The remnants of Larry re-organized in
   the eastern Pacific, with the National Hurricane Centre indicating for
   the possibility of redevelopment into a tropical depression on October
   9. However, the convection diminished, and further development was no
   longer anticipated.

Preparations

   Due to its erratic motion, the Mexican government issued a Tropical
   Storm Warning and a Hurricane Watch early in Larry's lifetime from Vera
   Cruz to Campeche. The watches and warnings were extended westward to
   Tuxpan on the 4th and extended eastward to Cuidad del Carmen on the
   5th. Due to the threat of the storm, officials closed three Pemex oil
   ports. The company used its reserves to make sure profits weren't
   disrupted. In addition, the storm closed shipping ports in Dos Bocas in
   Tabasco, Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz, and Cayo Arcas in Campeche. The
   Mexican government placed six coastal states on maximum alert, while
   authorities set up 75 evacuation shelters for around 1,500 people.
   Because of the storm, the government declared much of eastern Mexico as
   a state of emergency.

Impact

   Tropical Storm Larry was one of eight storms to hit Mexico from either
   the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, the highest since the record
   of nine in 1971. The National Hurricane Centre expected the storm to
   produce a storm surge of 3 to 5 feet, with high waves on top, though no
   official surge readings were reported. The highest recorded winds on
   land were 59 mph (95 km/h) in El Alacrán in Tabasco. The worst of
   Larry's effects came from its rainfall, peaking at 24.77 inches
   (629.2 mm) in Upper Juarez in southeastern Mexico. The highest 24 hour
   rainfall total was 9.6 inches (245.5 mm) in Tortuguero, Chiapas in 24
   hours, while several other locations reported over 4 inches in 24
   hours.

   The flooding damaged more than 21,000 houses across Mexico, in
   combination with the damage from Eastern Pacific Hurricanes Nora and
   Olaf. Damage was greatest around the Chipas capital of Tuxtla
   Gutiérrez, where over nine thousand houses were affected. The rainfall
   caused mudslides across the country, hospitalizing two individuals in
   central Hidalgo. The flooding also caused severe crop damage along
   Larry's path. Strong wind gusts caused outages to telephone and power
   services. In all, Larry caused 5 deaths and $53.6 million in damage
   (2003 USD, $59 million 2005 USD).

   In El Salvador, rainfall from the remnants of Larry, combined with
   previous rainfall, caused mudslides and flooding, forcing several
   thousand people to evacuate in San Salvador. The flooding destroyed or
   damaged hundreds of houses.

Aftermath

   Tropical Storm Larry hit Mexico at around the same time as two other
   tropical storms. The Mexican Red Cross provided aid for 6,587 families
   throughout the country, while the International Federation of Red Cross
   and Red Crescent Societies launched an international appeal for aid.
   The appeal raised $284,472.8 (2003 USD). The Mexican Red Cross
   distributed 4,000 food and hygiene packets to various places, and
   delivered 2,750 family packets and over 4,300 mattresses to citizens in
   Chiapas. 5,000 school kits were distributed, as well. A total of 38,750
   people benefited from the operation.

   The name Larry was not retired and is scheduled to be used next during
   the 2009 season.
