Theatre in the round

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Theatre

   Theatre-in-the-round or arena theatre is any theatre space in which the
   audience surrounds the stage area. In 1947, Margo Jones established
   America's first professional theatre-in-the-round company when she
   opened her Theatre ’47 in Dallas.

   As outlined by Margo Jones, her theatre-in-the-round concept requires
   no stage curtain, little scenery and allows the audience to sit on
   three sides of the stage. That stage design was used by directors in
   later years for such well-known shows as the original stage production
   of Man of La Mancha and all plays staged at the ANTA Washington Square
   Theatre (demolished in the late 1960s), including Arthur Miller's
   autobiographical After the Fall. Such theaters had previously existed
   in colleges but not in professional spaces.

   The stage itself in this arrangement is typically round, square, or
   triangular, with actors entering and exiting through the audience from
   different directions or from below the stage. Such a space is usually
   configured with the stage on an even level with or lowered below the
   audience in a "pit" or "arena" formation. This configuration lends
   itself to high-energy productions, and is especially favored by
   producers of classical theatre. Theatre-in-the-round was common in
   ancient theatre, particularly that of Greece and Rome but was not
   widely explored again until the latter half of the 20th Century; it has
   continued as a creative alternative to the more common Proscenium
   format.

   Theatre-in-the-round presents problems since actors at all times have
   their back facing some members of the audience. However, it also allows
   for interesting and realistic staging. The configuration is also
   commonly employed when theatrical performances are presented in
   non-traditional spaces such as restaurants, public areas such as fairs
   or festivals, or street theatre. Special consideration needs to be
   taken in regard to the set design, so as not to obscure any audience
   member's view of the performance.

   The innovations of Margo Jones were an obvious influence on Albert
   McCleery when he created his Cameo Theatre for television in 1950.
   Continuing until 1955, McCleery offered dramas seen against pure black
   backgrounds instead of walls of a set. This enabled cameras in the
   darkness to pick up shots from any position.

   When an arena staging was conceived for the progressive-rock group Yes
   by their tour manager Jim Halley in the mid 1970s, it prompted a
   redesign of rock concerts and venue seating arrangements.
