Emirate

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Politics and government

   Etymologically an emirate or amirate (Arabic: إمارة‎ translit: ,
   plural: إمارات Imarat) is the quality, dignity, office or territorial
   competence of any Emir (prince, governor etc.).

As monarchies

   Generally speaking, an emirate designates a political territory that is
   ruled by a dynastic Islamic Monarch styled emir (see that article). As
   most emirates have either disappeared, been integrated in a larger
   modern state or changed their rulers' styles, e.g. to Malik (Arabic for
   King) or Sultan, such true emirate-states have become rare.

   An example of this use persists in the United Arab Emirates, a federal
   nation that comprises seven federal emirates, each administered by a
   hereditary emir, these seven forming the electoral college for the
   federation's President and PM.

As provinces

   Furthermore, in Arabic (usually styled Sheikh) of the royal family, as
   in Saudi Arabian governorates.
