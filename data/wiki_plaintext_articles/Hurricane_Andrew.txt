   Hurricane Andrew was the second most destructive hurricane in U.S.
   history, and the final of three Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall
   in the United States in the 20th century. Striking as the first named
   storm of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season in August 1992, Andrew
   caused damage in the northwestern Bahamas, southern Florida south of
   Miami, and south-central Louisiana. Andrew's damage cost totaled $26
   billion in 1992 ($45 billion in 2005 US dollars), mostly in south
   Florida. The storm caused 65 deaths. With a central pressure ranking as
   the fourth lowest in U.S. landfall records, Andrew remained the most
   devastating natural disaster in U.S. history until it was surpassed by
   Hurricane Katrina in the 2005 season.

Storm history

   Storm path

   Andrew started modestly as a tropical wave that emerged from the west
   coast of Africa on August 14, and passed south of the Cape Verde
   islands. The wave spawned a tropical depression on August 16, which
   became Tropical Storm Andrew the next day.

   Further development was slow, as the west-northwestward moving Andrew
   encountered an unfavorable upper-level trough. Indeed, the storm almost
   dissipated on August 20 due to vertical wind shear. By August 21,
   Andrew was midway between Bermuda and Puerto Rico and then began
   turning westward into a more favorable environment. Rapid strengthening
   occurred, with Andrew reaching hurricane strength (sustained winds
   greater than 74 mph) on the 22nd and Category 5 status on the
   Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on the 23rd, peaking with 175 mph (280
   km/h) winds and a minimum pressure of 922 mbar ( hPa). The storm was
   extremely small, however, with gale-force (35 mph, 55 km/h) winds
   extending outwards only 90 miles (150 km) from the centre.

   Andrew made landfall twice while moving through the Bahamas, crossing
   Eleuthera with 160 mph (260 km/h) winds and passing through the Berry
   Islands at Great Harbour Cay with sustained winds of 150 mph (240
   km/h). The storm weakened after its second landfall, maintaining strong
   winds but with the pressure rising to 937 mbar. While crossing the Gulf
   Stream, however, Andrew quickly regained its strength, and briefly
   regained Category 5 status as it made landfall over south Florida on
   August 24 with 165 mph (265 km/h) winds and pressure of 922 mbar (hPa).

   The hurricane continued westward into the Gulf of Mexico as a Category
   4 hurricane, where it gradually turned northward. This motion brought
   Andrew to the central Louisiana coast (near Morgan City) on August 26
   as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds near 115mph. Andrew then
   turned northeastward, eventually merging with a frontal system over the
   mid-Atlantic states on August 28.

Statistics

   Reports from private barometers helped establish that Andrew's central
   pressure at landfall in Homestead, Florida, was 27.23 inches (922 hPa),
   which at the time made it the third most intense hurricane on record to
   hit the United States (it has since fallen to fourth, as of 2005
   Katrina).

   Andrew's peak winds in south Florida were not directly measured due to
   destruction of the measuring instruments. An automated station at Fowey
   Rocks reported 142 mph (228 km/h) sustained winds with gusts to 200 mph
   (321 km/h) (measured 144 ft (43.9 m) above the ground), and higher
   values may have occurred after the station was damaged and stopped
   reporting. A meteorologist living about a mile from the shoreline
   recorded a gust of 212 mph (341 km/h) before his instruments were
   destroyed.

   The National Hurricane Centre had a peak gust of 164 mph (272 km/h)
   (measured 130 ft (39.6 m) above the ground) just before the hurricane
   crippled its measuring devices, while a 177 mph (285 km/h) gust was
   measured at a private home. In 2002, as part of an ongoing review of
   historical hurricane records, National Hurricane Centre experts
   concluded that Andrew briefly had sustained winds of 165 mph (265 km/h)
   during and before landfall (Andrew had originally been classified as a
   Category 4 storm at landfall) . High gusts occurred in other locations
   throughout the state of Florida with 163 mph at Turkey Point power
   plant, and 160 mph at Turkey Point nuclear power plant, and 115 mph at
   Miami International Airport, with lower gusts throughout the state.

   Additionally, Berwick, Louisiana, reported 96 mph (154 km/h) sustained
   winds with gusts to 120 mph (193 km/h). The highest gust of 173 mph
   occurred in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana.

Records

   Andrew was only the third Category 5 hurricane to hit the United
   States, the previous ones being Hurricane Camille (which hit
   Mississippi and Louisiana in August 1969) and the Labor Day Hurricane
   of 1935 (which struck the Florida Keys in September 1935). No Category
   5 hurricane in the Atlantic has struck the United States(or anywhere
   else) at that intensity since.

Preparations

   10 to 14 ft storm surge, with locally 18 ft, was predicted prior to
   impact in the Bahamas. 5 to 8 inches of rain was also predicted.
   Evacuations were also ordered by emergency management officials, and
   residents throughout the region of Bahamas and Florida were warned to
   take precautions to protect life and property at 5 PM local time. By 11
   PM local time, residents were warned that precautions to protect life
   and property should have been completed. 7 to 10 foot storm surge was
   predicted for Eastern Florida, and the Florida Keys and 7 to 11 foot
   storm surge was predicted for Western Florida was predicted after the
   storm exitted Florida. Some isolated tornadoes were also predicted for
   South and Central Florida for August 23 and August 24. The National
   Guard was deployed to Florida to prevent looting. At least 1500 troops
   were deployed to the area.

   Sandbag walls were created in the South Bell Telephone Building in New
   Orleans. Sandbag walls were also created in the French Quarter section
   of New Orleans. Floodgates were also closed throughout New Orleans
   Levees. Sandbags for the public ran out, due to the protection of major
   areas. Planes headed to and from New Orleans were canceled.

   As with most high-intensity storms (Categories 4 and 5), the worst
   damage from Andrew is thought to have occurred not from straight-line
   winds but from vortices, or "miniwhirls" (something like embedded
   tornadoes). This was the conclusion of Tetsuya Theodore Fujita, a
   University of Chicago meteorologist who devised the Fujita scale for
   measuring the strength of tornadoes, after he surveyed Andrew's
   destruction in the Homestead area. There were thousands of these
   vortexes in Andrew; many of them could be traced for several miles, as
   they usually destroyed every building in their paths.

   Looting was also attempted in Florida after the storm left. At least
   100 people attempted to do so in a shopping mall south of Miami.
   However 600 National Guard troops in the region stopped their attempted
   theft.

   Andrew produced a 17 ft (5.2 m) storm surge near the landfall point in
   Florida, while storm tides of at least eight ft (2.4 m) inundated
   portions of the Louisiana coast. Andrew also produced a killer tornado
   in southeastern Louisiana. The F3 tornado hit LaPlace and stayed on
   ground until Reserve, St. John the Baptist Parish. The tornado caused
   two deaths.

   Andrew was responsible for 23 deaths in the United States and three
   more in the Bahamas. The hurricane caused $26.5 billion ( 1992 USD) in
   damage in the United States, of which $1 billion occurred in Louisiana
   and the rest in south Florida. Unlike most hurricanes, the vast
   majority of the damage in Florida was due to the winds. The
   agricultural loss in Florida was $1.04 billion alone. Damage in the
   Bahamas was estimated at $250 million.

   In Dade County 90% of homes had major roof damage. 117,000 were
   destroyed or had major damage.

   The Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station was hit directly by Andrew.
   Over $90 million of damage was done, largely to a water tank and to a
   smokestack of one of the fossil-fueled units on-site, but the
   containment buildings were undamaged. The nuclear plant was built to
   withstand winds of up to 235 mph.

   Massive damage caused by Andrew at Homestead Air Force Base, very near
   the point of landfall on the South Florida coast, led to the closing of
   the base as a full active-duty base. It was later partly rebuilt and
   operates today as a U.S. Air Reserve base. The aircraft and squadron
   were relocated to Aviano AFB in Italy.

   Power lines bringing electric power to the Florida Keys were destroyed,
   leaving residents without power. However water was maintained, although
   it had to be boiled.

   There was also moderate damage to the coral reef areas offshore of
   Florida down to depths of 75 feet.

Louisiana

   About 152,000 electricity customers lost their power due to the impact
   of Andrew. Four people were also killed, as a result of Andrew.

   Damage was done to soy bean, corn, and sugar cane crops. The damage
   estimated done to the sugar cane was $200 million.

   A Coast Guard helicopter had to rescue 4 people and 2 dogs from a
   disabled 65 foot fishing boat, 50 miles south of Houma.

   Andrew's catastrophic damage spawned many rumors, including claims that
   hundreds or even thousands of migrant farm workers in south Dade County
   (now Miami-Dade County) were killed and their deaths were not reported
   in official accounts. An investigation by the Miami Herald found no
   basis for such rumors. These rumors were probably based on the 1928
   Okeechobee Hurricane, when the deaths of migrant workers initially went
   uncounted, and were still debated at the time of Andrew.

   The slow response of federal aid to storm victims in southern Florida
   led Dade County emergency management director Kate Hale to famously
   exclaim at a nationally televised news conference, "Where in the hell
   is the cavalry on this one? They keep saying we're going to get
   supplies. For God's sake, where are they?" Almost immediately,
   President George H. W. Bush promised, "Help is on the way," and mobile
   kitchens and tents began pouring in.

   Insurance claims in the wake of the extreme damage left by Andrew led
   to the bankruptcy and closure of 11 insurance agencies and drained an
   excessive amount of equity from 30 more. Nearly one million residences
   were no longer eligible for coverage by any insurance agency. This led
   the Florida Legislature to create new agencies (the Joint Underwriting
   Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association and the
   Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund) to restore adequate insurance
   coverage.

   Homeowners and officials criticized developers and contractors for
   inadequate building practices and poor building codes. An inquiry after
   the storm concluded that there were probably construction flaws in some
   buildings, and that the state of Florida did enforce some strict
   building codes since 1986, but they were either overlooked or ignored.
   However, the evidence was not sufficient enough to issue criminal
   charges for neglect.

   The effects of Hurricane Andrew on Florida wetlands were considerable.
   In the Florida Everglades, 25% (700,000 acres) of the trees in the
   everglades were knocked down by the storm. However, new trees and
   vegetation grew 20 days after the storms passing. Damage to marine life
   was moderate as the storm increased the turbidity and lowered the
   oxygen level in the water, threatening many fish and other marine
   wildlife. In addition, the storm killed 182 million fish in the basin,
   causing $160 million dollars (1992 USD) in lost value. In the decade
   after the storm, Hurricane Andrew may have contributed to the massive
   and sudden housing boom in Broward County, Florida. Located just north
   of Miami-Dade County, residents who had lost their homes migrated to
   western sections of the county that were just starting to be developed.
   The result was record growth in places like Miramar, Pembroke Pines and
   Weston. Two of these three cities have been listed in the top ten
   Fastest Growing Cities Within The United States within the past
   fourteen years .

Louisiana

   In Louisiana, the hurricane knocked down 80 percent of the trees in
   part of the Atchafalaya River Basin near the coast. Offshore, the storm
   killed 9.4 million fish, causing $7.8 million dollars (1992 USD) in
   lost value, and damaged large area of marshland along the Louisiana
   coast.

   About 6,200 people had to be housed in 36 seperate shelters, according
   to the American Red Cross. The Salvation Army sent in 37 mobile food
   storage faculities, that served 40,000 meals, to help those who could
   get little or no food.

   Federal aid, from the Pentagon, sent in four 750,000 kilowatt
   generators, 2,500 cots, and 30,000 MRE's, or prepackaged meals, to
   Louisiana. About 1,279 National Guard were deployed to Louisiana, to do
   various duties, from cooking to patrolling.

   Sheriefs along the coast of Louisiana imposed a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6
   a.m. local time. Alcohol sales were also banned immediately after the
   storm.

Retirement

   The name Andrew was retired in the spring of 1993 and will never again
   be used for an Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with Alex in the
   1998 season.
