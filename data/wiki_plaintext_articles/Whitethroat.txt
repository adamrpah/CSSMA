   The Whitethroat, Sylvia communis, is a common and widespread Old World
   warbler which breeds throughout Europe and across much of temperate
   western Asia.

   This small passerine bird is strongly migratory, and winters in
   tropical Africa, Arabia and India.

   This is a bird of open country and cultivation, with bushes for
   nesting. The nest is built in low shrub or brambles, and 3-7 eggs are
   laid.

   Although most warblers have the sexes identical, several Sylvia species
   have distinct male and female plumages. This is a small warbler, mainly
   brown above and buff below. The wings are chestnut. The adult male has
   a grey head and a white throat. The female lacks the grey head, and the
   throat is duller. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous, but will
   also take berries and other soft fruit.

   The Whitethroat's song is fast and scratchy, with a scolding tone.
