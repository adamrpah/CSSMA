   Hurricane Phillippe was a short-lived hurricane that formed over the
   Atlantic in September during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.
   Philippe was the sixteenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the
   season.

   Hurricane Philippe initially formed to the east of the Lesser Antilles
   on September 17 and moved to the north strengthening as it did so.
   Philippe became a hurricane on September 18 and stayed as such for two
   days before increasing wind shear from a non-tropical system took its
   toll on September 20 and weakened Philippe into a tropical storm.
   Philippe continued to weaken as it looped around this low and was
   absorbed by it on September 23.

Storm history

   Storm path

   On September 9 a tropical wave moved off the African coast and moved
   west into the Atlantic. It started to become more organized on
   September 13 and the National Hurricane Centre began to watch it
   closely for further development. Tropical Depression Seventeen formed
   from the wave on September 17 when it was 350 miles (560 km) east of
   Barbados. The depression strengthened further to become Tropical Storm
   Philippe that evening, and the official forecasts correctly indicated
   that Philippe would move northwards and not approach the Lesser
   Antilles despite climatology suggesting an impact on the islands.

   Philippe continued to steadily strengthen, becoming a hurricane late on
   September 18 as it traveled north in a low-shear environment and some
   models suggested that this trend would continue and Philippe would go
   on to become a major hurricane. However Philippe began to encounter
   higher wind shear from a non-tropical low, the development of which
   partly resulted from Hurricane Rita's outflow. As a result of this
   shear Philippe's winds only managed to reach a peak of 80 mph (130
   km/h) before Philippe weakened back into a tropical storm on September
   20.

   Philippe moved farther north skirting the low and Philippe continued to
   weaken gradually. The official forecast did not predict this, primarily
   as a result of some models indicating a reintensification to hurricane
   status. Philippe began to loop around the centre of the non-tropical
   system, weakening as it did so. As Philippe turned towards Bermuda it
   weakened into a tropical depression on September 22. The depression
   degenerated into a remnant low the next day and this remnant continued
   to loop cyclonically and could be tracked for a further day or two
   within the circulation of the non-tropical system.

Impact

   A tropical storm warning was issued for Bermuda on September 23 but
   proved redundant when Philippe dissipated well to the south of the
   island. Despite forming fairly close to the Lesser Antilles, no
   warnings were issued as the official forecast correctly foresaw that
   Philippe would stay well to the east.

   Hurricane Philippe never affected any land areas and no damage or
   fatalities were reported.

Naming and records

   When Tropical Storm Philippe formed on September 17, it was the
   earliest ever in the season that the sixteenth storm formed, beating
   the previous record held by Storm 16 of the 1933 season by 10 days.
   Philippe was only the third Atlantic storm to be named with the letter
   ' P'; the other two were Pablo in 1995 and Peter in 2003. Due to the
   lack of any effects from Hurricane Philippe, the name was not retired
   by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on the list of
   names for the 2011 season.
