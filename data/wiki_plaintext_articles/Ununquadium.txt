   Ununquadium ( IPA: /ˌjuːˌnʌnˈkwɒdiəm/), or eka- lead, is the temporary
   name of a radioactive chemical element in the periodic table that has
   the temporary symbol Uuq and has the atomic number 114.

History

   The discovery of ununquadium in December 1998 was reported in January
   1999 by scientists at Dubna ( Joint Institute for Nuclear Research) in
   Russia. The same team produced another isotope of Uuq three months
   later and confirmed the synthesis in 2004 and 2006.

   In 2004 in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research the synthesis of
   this element was confirmed by another method (the chemical identifying
   on final products of decay of element).

   Ununquadium is a temporary IUPAC systematic element name. Some have
   termed it eka-lead, as its properties are conjectured to be similar to
   those of lead. It is expected to be a soft, dense metal that tarnishes
   in air, with a melting point around 200 degrees Celsius.

Synthesis

   Ununquadium can be synthesized by bombarding plutonium 244 targets with
   calcium 48 heavy ion beams.

Synthesis of isotope 298

   Manufacturing Ununquadium-298 would be very difficult, because nuclei
   summing to 114 protons and 184 neutrons are not available in weighable
   quantities.

   However it may be possible to generate the isotope 298 of Element 114,
   if nuclear transfer reactions can be achieved. One of these reactions
   may be: ^204Hg + ^136Xe → ^298Unq + ^40Ca + 2n

Stable ununquadium

   Ununquadium does not occur naturally on the earth—it is entirely
   synthesized in laboratories. All isotopes of ununquadium synthesized so
   far are neutron-poor. This means that they contain significantly-fewer
   neutrons than 184, which is a hypothetical "magic number" of neutrons
   for greater stability (isotope Uuq-298). Neutron-poor also indicates
   that the isotopes decay either by spontaneous fission, or by one of the
   two processes that convert a proton into a neutron, yielding element
   113.
