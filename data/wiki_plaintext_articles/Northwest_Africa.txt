Northwest Africa

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: African Geography

   Northwest Africa or Northwestern Africa is a variably defined region of
   the African continent. The term is commonly used in various
   disciplines: geopolitics, archaeology, anthropology, and genetics.
   Incorporating cardinal directions, the term is preferred over use of
   Maghreb and similar terms possibly due to the cultural underpinnings of
   those terms.

   The countries and territories in Northwestern Africa include:
     * Algeria
     * Libya
     * Morocco
     * Mauritania
     * Tunisia
     * Western Sahara

   Maghreb, Barbary, and Tamazgha are more or less synonymous with
   Northwestern Africa.
