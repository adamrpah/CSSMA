   The Mistle Thrush (Turdus viscivorus) is a common member of the thrush
   family Turdidae.

   It is found in open woods and cultivated land over all of Europe and
   much of Asia. Many northern birds move south during the winter. The
   Mistle Thrush averages about 27 cm long, larger than the similar Song
   Thrush. The sexes are similar, with plain greyish brown backs and
   neatly round-spotted underparts. The breast has much less buff than the
   Song Thrush.

   It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms, and
   berries. A Mistle Thrush will defend a berry-bearing tree against other
   thrushes in winter. Migrating birds sometimes form small flocks.

   They nest in trees, laying several eggs in a neat cup-shaped nest lined
   with grass.

   The male sings its loud melodious song from a tree, rooftop or other
   elevated perch, often during bad weather or at night, and starting
   relatively early in the spring â€” hence the Mistle Thrush's old name of
   "Stormcock". The song is like a harder and simpler version of the
   Blackbird's. The alarm call is said to sound like a football rattle (a
   form of musical ratchet) or machine gun.
