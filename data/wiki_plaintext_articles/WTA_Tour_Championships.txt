WTA Tour Championships

   The WTA Tour Championships is a tennis tournament played annually at
   the end of the season for the top-ranked players on the Women's Tennis
   Association (WTA) tour.

   The championships were held for the first time in 1972 at Boca Raton,
   Florida (USA). From 1972- 1986, the event was held in March. The WTA
   then decided to adopt a January-to-November playing season, and so the
   event was switched to being held at the end of each year. Because of
   this changeover, two championships were held in 1986. From 1979- 2000,
   the event was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The event
   then briefly moved to Germany ( 2001). More recently, it has been held
   in Los Angeles, California ( 2002- 2005). The 2006 edition was held in
   Madrid, Spain, the site of the 2007 tournament as well.

   From 1972- 1994, the event was known as the Virginia Slims
   Championships. Since then it has been officially known by the names of
   other sponsors (it was called the Chase Championships for a few years
   in the late-1990s), but is more commonly referred to as the "WTA Tour
   Championships".

   From 1984- 1998, the final of the championships was a best-of-five-set
   match – making it the only tournament on the women's tour to have a
   best-of-five-set match at any round of the competition. In 1999, the
   final was reverted to being a best-of-three-set match.

   The WTA Tour Championships are generally considered to be the fifth
   most prestigious event on the women's tour after the four Grand Slam
   tournaments.
