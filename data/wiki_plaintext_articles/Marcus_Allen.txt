   Marcus LeMarr Allen (born March 26, 1960 in San Diego, California) is a
   former American football player, and until recently affiliated with CBS
   as a game analyst. As a professional, Allen ran for 12,243 yards and
   caught 587 passes for 5,411 yards during his career for both the Los
   Angeles Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs from 1982 to 1997. He scored
   145 touchdowns including a then league record 123 rushing touchdowns
   and was elected to six Pro Bowls when he retired. He was also a fairly
   good passer for a running back, completing 12 of 27 passes for 285
   yards and 6 touchdowns, with only 1 interception. Allen was the first
   player ever to gain more than 10,000 rushing yards and 5,000 receiving
   yards during his career.

   Allen is considered as one of the greatest goal line and short-yardage
   runners in National Football League history. ^He was inducted into the
   College Football Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame
   in 2003. He is the older brother of Damon Allen, who plays in the
   Canadian Football League.

High school career

   He played football at Lincoln Senior High School in San Diego where he
   played the quarterback and defensive back positions.

College career

   Allen played running back at the University of Southern California from
   1978-1981. He spent his first 2 seasons at USC as a backup to Heisman
   Trophy winning running back Charles White. In 1980, he became a starter
   and rushed for 1,563 yards, the second most in the nation that year.
   Then in 1981, Allen had one of the most spectacular seasons in NCAA
   history. He rushed for 2,342 yards, becoming the frist player in NCAA
   history to rush for over 2,000 yards in one season.^ He also gained a
   total of 2,683 offensive yards, led the nation in scoring, and won the
   Heisman Trophy, the Maxwell Trophy, and Walter Camp Award and was also
   the Pac-10 player of the year ^. Allen shares the NCAA record for most
   200-yard rushing games with Ricky Williams and Ron Dayne, with twelve
   games reaching the bicentennial mark.

   USC has retired his jersey number (#33), and coach John Robinson called
   Allen "The greatest player I ever saw" ^.

   While being interviewed by Byron Allen, Ronnie Lott said that he and
   Marcus Allen would not have graduated from college without cheating
   with the help of Byron Allen

NFL career

   Allen was drafted as the tenth overall pick on the first round of the
   1982 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Raiders. In his rookie season in
   1982, he rushed for 697 yards as he led the Raiders to the best record
   in the AFC with a strike-shortned 8-1 record and was elected as NFL
   Offensive Rookie of the Year. The Raiders would lose to the New York
   Jets in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.

   The next season, Marcus rushed for over 1,000 yards for the first time,
   he would do that again in 1984 and 1985. That season, he rushed for
   1,759 yards and scored 11 touchdowns on 380 carries as he led the
   Raiders to a 12-4 record and the AFC West Title and was named the NFL
   MVP. During that time, he also caught 60 or more receptions for 3 years
   running (1983-85).

   Allen is best remembered for his heroics in Super Bowl XVIII. He ran
   for 191 yards, caught 2 passes for 18 yards, and scored 2 touchdowns in
   the Raiders 38-9 victory over the Washington Redskins. This included a
   74-yard touchdown run, a record that was the longest run in Super Bowl
   history, until Super Bowl XL when it was broken by Willie Parker, by a
   single yard.

   After a stormy relationship with Al Davis including missing most of the
   1989 season with a knee injury, he left Los Angeles to join the Kansas
   City Chiefs in 1993, that year he rushed for only 764 yards, but scored
   12 touchdowns leading the AFC^ , as he and Joe Montana led the Chiefs
   to the AFC Championship Game and was named the NFL Comeback Player of
   the Year that season. Allen went on to play for the Chiefs for four
   more seasons, leading the team in rushing every year but his last.
   Allen's main contribution to the Chiefs was his leadership abilities.
   The Chiefs won more games than any other NFL team during his tenure in
   Kansas City. Allen made many contributions to charitable causes off the
   field in Kansas City. He also hosted his own talk show on Sunday
   mornings before Chiefs games. Allen retired after 1997 season. In 1999,
   he was ranked number 72 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest
   Football Players.

   In August 2005, Allen and CBS Sports parted ways. The network began to
   diminish Allen's role over the last few years. Allen currently works
   for the NFL Network.
