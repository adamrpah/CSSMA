   Strontium ( IPA: /ˈstrɒntiəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic
   table that has the symbol Sr and the atomic number 38. An alkaline
   earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white or yellowish metallic
   element that is highly reactive chemically. The metal turns yellow when
   exposed to air. It occurs naturally in the minerals celestite and
   strontianite. The ^90Sr isotope is present in radioactive fallout and
   has a half-life of 28.90 years.

Notable characteristics

   Due to its extreme reactivity to air, this element occurs naturally
   only in compounds with other elements, as in the minerals strontianite
   and celestite.

   Strontium is a bright silvery metal that is softer than calcium and
   even more reactive in water, which strontium decomposes on contact to
   produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It burns in air to
   produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but since it does
   not react with nitrogen below 380°C it will only form the oxide
   spontaneously at room temperature. It should be kept under kerosene to
   prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a
   yellowish colour with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered
   strontium metal will ignite spontaneously in air. Volatile strontium
   salts impart a crimson colour to flames, and these salts are used in
   pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Natural strontium is a
   mixture of four stable isotopes.

Applications

   At present the primary use for strontium is in glass for colour
   television cathode ray tubes.

   Other commercial uses:
     * Production of ferrite magnets and refining zinc.
     * Strontium titanate has an extremely high refractive index and an
       optical dispersion greater than that of diamond, making it useful
       in a variety of optics applications.
     * Strontium titanate has been cut into gemstones, in particular for
       its use as diamond simulant. However, it is very soft and easily
       scratches so it is rarely used.
     * Strontium is also used in fireworks for red colour.
     * Strontium aluminate is used as a bright phosphor with long
       persistence of phosphorescence.
     * Strontium chloride is sometimes used in toothpastes for sensitive
       teeth. One popular brand includes 10% strontium chloride
       hexahydrate by weight.
     * Strontium oxide is sometimes used to improve the quality of some
       pottery glazes.
     * ^89Sr is the active ingredient in Metastron, a radiopharmaceutical
       used for bone pain secondary to metastatic prostate cancer. The
       strontium acts like calcium and is preferentially incorporated into
       bone at sites of increased osteogenesis. This localization focuses
       the radiation exposure on the cancerous lesion.
     * ^90Sr has been used as a power source for RTGs. ^90Sr produces
       about 0.93 watts of heat per gram (it is lower for the grade of
       ^90Sr used in RTGs, which is strontium fluoride). However, ^90Sr
       has a lifetime approximately 3 times shorter and has a lower
       density than ^238Pu, another RTG fuel. The main advantage of ^90Sr
       is that it is cheaper than ^238Pu and is found in nuclear waste.
     * ^90Sr is also used in cancer therapy. Its beta emission and long
       half-life is ideal for superficial radiotherapy.
     * Strontium is also commonly used in aerosol paint, such as the
       Spanish Montana (Montana Hardcore). This is one of the most likely
       sources of exposure to the public.

History

   The mineral strontianite is named after the Scottish village of
   Strontian having been discovered in the lead mines there in 1787 - see
   Murray (1977). Adair Crawford recognized it as differing from other
   barium minerals in 1790. Strontium itself was discovered in 1798 and
   metallic strontium was first isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 using
   electrolysis.

   Strontium was among the radioactive materials released by the 1957
   Windscale fire.

Occurrence

   Strontium commonly occurs in nature, the 15th most abundant element on
   earth, averaging 0.034% of all igneous rock and is found chiefly as the
   form of the sulfate mineral celestite (SrSO[4]) and the carbonate
   strontianite (SrCO[3]). Of the two, celestite occurs much more
   frequently in sedimentary deposits of sufficient size to make
   development of mining facilities attractive. Strontianite would be the
   more useful of the two common minerals because strontium is used most
   often in the carbonate form, but few deposits have been discovered that
   are suitable for development. The metal can be prepared by electrolysis
   of melted strontium chloride mixed with potassium chloride:

   Sr^2+ + 2 e^- → Sr
   2 Cl^- → Cl[2 (g)] + 2 e^-

   Alternatively it is made by reducing strontium oxide with aluminium in
   a vacuum at a temperature at which strontium distills off. Three
   allotropes of the metal exist, with transition points at 235 and 540
   °C. Strontium metal (98% pure) in January 1990 cost about $5/oz. The
   largest commercially exploited deposits are found in England.

Isotopes

   The alkali earth metal strontium has four stable, naturally occurring
   isotopes: ^84Sr (0.56%), ^86Sr (9.86%), ^87Sr (7.0%) and ^88Sr
   (82.58%). Only ^87Sr is radiogenic; it is produced by decay from the
   radioactive alkali metal ^87Rb, which has a half-life of 4.88 × 10^10
   years. Thus, there are two sources of ^87Sr in any material: that
   formed during primordial nucleo-synthesis along with ^84Sr, ^86Sr and
   ^88Sr, as well as that formed by radioactive decay of ^87Rb. The ratio
   ^87Sr/^86Sr is the parameter typically reported in geologic
   investigations; ratios in minerals and rocks have values ranging from
   about 0.7 to greater than 4.0. Because strontium has an atomic radius
   similar to that of calcium, it readily substitutes for Ca in minerals.

   Sixteen unstable isotopes are known to exist. Of greatest importance is
   ^90Sr with a half-life of 28.78 years. It is a by-product of nuclear
   fission which is found in nuclear fallout and presents a health problem
   since it substitutes for calcium in bone, preventing expulsion from the
   body. This isotope is one of the best long-lived high-energy beta
   emitters known, and is used in SNAP ( Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary
   Power) devices. These devices hold promise for use in spacecraft,
   remote weather stations, navigational buoys, etc, where a lightweight,
   long-lived, nuclear-electric power source is required. The 1986
   Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated a vast area with ^90Sr.

Precautions

   In its pure form strontium is extremely reactive with air and
   spontaneously combusts. It is therefore considered to be a fire hazard.

Effect on the human body

   The human body absorbs strontium as if it were calcium. Due to the
   elements being sufficiently similar chemically, the stable forms of
   strontium do not pose a significant health threat, but the radioactive
   ^90Sr can lead to various bone disorders and diseases, including bone
   cancer. The strontium unit is used in measuring radioactivity from
   absorbed ^90Sr.

   An experimental drug made by combining strontium with ranelic acid has
   aided in bone growth, boosted bone density and lessened fractures.
   (El-Hajj, 2004) Women receiving the drug showed a 6.8% increase in bone
   density. Women receiving a placebo had a 1.3% decrease. (Meunier et.
   al, 2004). Half the increase in bone density (measured by x-ray
   densitometry) is attributed to the higher atomic weight of Sr compared
   with calcium, whereas the other half is assumed to be a true increase
   in bone mineral content. Strontium ranelate is registered for treatment
   of osteoporosis in Europe at a dose of 2 grams daily.

   Several naturally occurring strontium compounds have additionally been
   found to enhance bone growth and density and lessen the incidence of
   fractures, and efficacy of treatment has not been shown to vary
   significantly between various strontium compounds. These compounds
   include strontium lactate (McCaslin et. al, Mayo Clin.
   1959;34(13):329-34), strontium citrate (Wright et. al, Tahoma Clin.),
   strontium carbonate and strontium gluconate (Skoryna et. al, 1984).
