   This is an alphabetical list of countries of the world, including both
   internationally recognized and generally unrecognized independent
   states, inhabited dependent territories, as well as areas of special
   sovereignty. It covers all areas under the jurisdiction of the listed
   countries, namely territory, territorial waters (including internal
   waters and contiguous zone), exclusive economic zone, continental
   shelf, and airspace. For a list of independent states only, see the
   list of sovereign states.

   The names of countries in the list are given in English and include
   both an English version of the short official names (e.g. Afghanistan)
   and an English version of the (longer) official names (e.g. Islamic
   Republic of Afghanistan). The listing of any name in this article is
   not meant to imply an official position in any naming dispute.
