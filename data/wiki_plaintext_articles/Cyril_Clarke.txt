   Sir Cyril Astley Clarke ( 22 August 1907– 21 November 2000) was a
   British physician, lepidopterist and geneticist.

   Cyril Clarke's school education was at Wyggestson Grammar School in
   Leicester and Oundle School near Peterborough. His interest in
   butterflies and moths began at school. His studied natural science at
   Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge University and then medicine at
   Guy's Hospital, London. During the Second World War he worked as a
   medic in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.

   Clarke is well known for his work on Rh disease of the newborn. He
   helped to developed the technique of giving Rh-negative women
   inter-muscular injections of anti-RhD antibodies during pregnancy to
   prevent Rh disease in their newborn babies. This was one of the major
   advances in preventive medicine in the second half of the 20th century.

   Clarke answered an advert in an insect magazine for swallowtail
   butterfly pupae that had been placed by Philip Sheppard. They met and
   began working together in their common interest of lepidoptery. From
   1959 they started running a moth trap in Caldy Common near West Kirby,
   Wirral, England. They studied the peppered moth, the scarlet tiger moth
   and swallowtail butterfly. They published papers on the genetics of
   lepidopera and also on Rh disease. Clarke continued research in his
   retirement and in 1988 he rediscovered a Scarlet Tiger Moth colony on
   the Wirral Way, West Kirby, that had been started in 1961 by Philip
   Sheppard. The colony was useful for study of the genetics of changes in
   populations.

   He was married Frieda (or Féo) in 1934. Lady Féo Clarke died in 1998.
   Cyril Clark died in 2000. They had three sons.
