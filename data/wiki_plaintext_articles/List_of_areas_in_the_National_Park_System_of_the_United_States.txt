   National Park Service logo

   The National Park System of the United States is the collection of
   physical properties owned or administered by the National Park Service.
   This includes all areas designated National Parks and most National
   Monuments, as well as several other types of protected areas of the
   United States.

   As of 2006, there are 390 " units" of the National Park System.
   However, this number is somewhat misleading. For example: Denali
   National Park and Preserve is counted as two units, whereas Fort
   Moultrie National Monument is not counted as a unit because it is
   considered a feature of Fort Sumter National Monument.

   In addition to areas of the National Park System, the National Park
   Service also provides technical and financial assistance to several
   "affiliated areas" authorized by Congress. Affiliated areas are marked
   on the lists below.

   The National Register of Historic Places is administered by the Park
   Service (with nearly 79,000 entries) and automatically includes all
   National Park System areas designated due to their historic
   significance. This includes all National Historical Parks/Historic
   Sites, National Battlefields/Military Parks, National Memorials, and
   some National Monuments.

   Delaware is the only state without a unit of the park system. Units are
   also found in Washington, D.C., Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin
   Islands, and Puerto Rico.

   Nearly all units managed by the National Park Service participate in
   the national park passport stamps program.
