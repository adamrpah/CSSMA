   The FIFA World Cup, sometimes called the Football World Cup or the
   Soccer World Cup, but usually referred to simply as the World Cup, is
   an international football (soccer) competition contested by the men's
   national football teams of the member nations of Fédération
   Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global
   governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years
   since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to
   World War II.

   The tournament's final phase, often called the World Cup Finals, is the
   most widely-viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 1.1
   billion people watching the 2002 tournament final. The current format
   of the Finals involves thirty-two national teams competing at venues
   within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. To
   determine the participating teams, qualifying rounds take place over
   the three years preceding the Finals.

   In the eighteen tournaments held, only seven nations have won the
   title. Brazil is the most successful World Cup team, having won the
   tournament five times. The current Cup holder, Italy, follows with four
   titles, while Germany holds three. The other former champions are
   Uruguay and Argentina with two titles each, and England and France with
   one title each.

   The most recent World Cup Finals were held between June 9 and July 9,
   2006 in Germany, where Italy was crowned champions after beating France
   in the final, winning the penalty shootout 5-3 after the match finished
   1-1 after extra time. The next World Cup Finals will be held in 2010 in
   South Africa.

   Since 1991, FIFA has also organized the FIFA Women's World Cup every
   four years.

History

Previous international competitions

   The first international football match was played in 1872 between
   Scotland and England. At this stage the sport was rarely played outside
   Great Britain and Ireland. As football began to increase in popularity
   in other parts of the world at the turn of the century, it was held as
   a demonstration sport (with no medals awarded) at the 1900 and 1904
   Summer Olympics, and at the 1906 Intercalated Games; football became an
   official competition at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Planned by The
   Football Association, the event was for amateur players only and was
   regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great
   Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team) won
   the event in both 1908 and 1912.

   After FIFA was founded in 1904, there was an attempt made by FIFA to
   arrange an international football tournament between nations outside of
   the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early
   days for international football, and the official history of FIFA
   describes the competition as having been a failure.

   With the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur
   teams, Sir Thomas Lipton organized the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy
   tournament in Turin in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship
   between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations,
   each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is
   sometimes described as The First World Cup, and featured the most
   prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and
   Switzerland, but The Football Association of England refused to be
   associated with the competition and declined the offer to send
   professional team. Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from
   County Durham to represent England instead. West Auckland won the
   tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title, and
   were given the trophy to keep forever, as per the rules of the
   competition.

   In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a "world
   football championship for amateurs", and took responsibility for
   managing the event. This paved the way for the world's first
   intercontinental football competition, at the 1920 Summer Olympics,
   contested by Egypt (who were knocked out in their first match) and
   thirteen European teams. The gold medals were won by Belgium. Uruguay
   then won the Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928. In 1928
   FIFA made the decision to stage their own international tournament
   outside of the Olympics. With Uruguay now two-time official football
   world champions (as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era) and
   to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named
   Uruguay as the host country.

   The 1932 Summer Olympics, held in Los Angeles, did not plan to include
   football as part of the schedule due to the low popularity of football
   in the United States, as American football had been growing in
   popularity. FIFA and the IOC also disagreed over the status of amateur
   players, and so football was dropped from the Games. FIFA president
   Jules Rimet thus planned the inaugural World Cup tournament to be held
   in Uruguay in 1930. The national associations of selected nations were
   invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the
   competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for
   European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team
   until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually
   persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make
   the trip. In total 13 nations took part — seven from South America,
   four from Europe and two from North America.

   The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won
   by France and the USA, who beat Mexico 4-1 and Belgium 3-0,
   respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by Lucien
   Laurent of France. In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4-2 in
   front of a crowd of 93,000 people in Montevideo, and became the first
   nation to win a World Cup.

Growth

   The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties
   of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were
   willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 and 1938 tournaments, with
   Brazil the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and
   1946 competitions were cancelled due to World War II and its aftermath.

   The 1950 World Cup was the first to include British participants.
   British teams withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness
   to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as
   a protest against a foreign influence to football, but rejoined in 1946
   following FIFA's invitation. The tournament also saw the return of 1930
   champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups.
   Uruguay won the tournament again.

   In the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams competed for each
   finals tournament, except in 1938 and 1950 when teams withdrew after
   qualifying, leaving them with 15 and 13 teams respectively. Most of the
   participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small
   minority from North America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. These teams were
   usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until
   1978, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance
   out of the first round were: United States, semi-finalists in 1930;
   Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in
   1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.

   The finals were expanded to 24 teams in 1982, then to 32 in 1998,
   allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part.
   The one exception is Oceania, who have never had a guaranteed spot in
   the finals. In recent years, teams from these regions have enjoyed more
   success, and those who have reached the knockout stage include: Mexico,
   quarterfinalists in 1986 and reaching the knockout rounds in 1994,
   1998, 2002 and 2006; Morocco, reaching the knockout rounds in 1986;
   Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; Costa Rica, reaching the knockout
   rounds in 1990; Nigeria, reaching the knockout rounds in 1994 and 1998;
   Saudi Arabia, reaching the knockout rounds in 1994; United States,
   reaching the knockout rounds in 1994 and quarter-finalists in 2002;
   South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal,
   quarter-finalists in 2002; Japan, reaching the knockout rounds in 2002;
   and Australia and Ghana, both reaching the knockout rounds in 2006.
   However, European and South American teams have remained the stronger
   forces. For example, the quarter-finalists in 2006 were all from Europe
   or South America.

   198 nations attempted to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and all
   but three of the 207 FIFA member nations have previously entered the
   competition, with Comoros, East Timor and Bhutan the only current
   members not yet to have entered (Comoros and East Timor were not FIFA
   members at the time of the qualifying draw for the 2006 tournament, and
   so have not yet had an opportunity to take part).

   An equivalent tournament for women's football, the FIFA Women's World
   Cup, was first held in 1991 in the People's Republic of China.

Trophy

   From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded to the World Cup
   winner. It was originally simply known as the World Cup or Coupe du
   Monde, but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet
   who set up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory in the
   tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the
   trophy was stolen in 1983, and has never been recovered, apparently
   melted down by the thieves.

   After 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, was
   designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven different countries,
   valued the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the
   Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is 36 cm high, made
   of solid 18- carat gold and weighs 6175 grammes. The base contains two
   layers of semi-precious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy
   bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since
   1974. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: "The lines spring
   out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the
   world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the
   sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of
   victory."

   This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently,
   irrespective of how many World Cups they win. World Cup winners retain
   the trophy until the next tournament and are awarded a gold-plated
   replica rather than the solid gold original. Argentina, Germany (as
   West Germany), Italy and Brazil have all won the second trophy twice,
   while France have won it once. It will not be retired until the name
   plaque has been entirely filled with the names of winning nations in
   2038.

Format

Qualification

   Since the second World Cup in 1934, qualifying tournaments have been
   held to thin the field for the final tournament. They are held within
   the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America
   and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, Europe), overseen by their
   respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number
   of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand,
   generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams,
   but also subject to lobbying from the confederations.

   The qualification process can start as early as almost three years
   before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The
   formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations.
   Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental
   play-offs. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the
   fifth-placed team from the South American zone entered a play-off to
   decide which team would qualify for the 2006 World Cup. From the 1938
   World Cup onwards, host nations have received an automatic berth in the
   finals. This right also used to be granted to the defending champion,
   but from the 2006 finals onwards, this entitlement has been withdrawn,
   requiring the champions to qualify as well.

Final tournament

   The current finals tournament features 32 national teams competing over
   a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: a group stage
   followed by a knockout stage.

   In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams
   each. The finals draw, held six months before the tournament in the
   host nation, determines the groups. Eight teams are seeded (including
   the hosts, with the other teams selected using a formula based on both
   the FIFA World Rankings and performances in recent World Cups) and
   drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different
   "pots", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot
   are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since 1998, constraints have
   been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two
   European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.

   Each group plays a round-robin tournament, guaranteeing that every team
   will play at least three matches. The last round of matches of each
   group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among the
   teams. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage.
   Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, three
   points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss
   (prior to this, winners received two points rather than three). If two
   or more teams end up with the same number of points, tiebreakers are
   used: first is goal difference, then total goals scored, then
   head-to-head results, and finally drawing of lots (i.e. determining
   team positions at random).

   The knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams
   play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty
   shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the
   "round of 16" (or the second round) in which the winner of each group
   plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the
   quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by
   the losing semi-finalists), and the final.

Selection of hosts

   Early World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's
   congress. The choice of location was highly controversial, given the
   three-week boat journey between South America and Europe, the two
   centres of strength in football. The decision to hold the first World
   Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations
   competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The
   decision to hold the second of these, the 1938 FIFA World Cup, in
   France was controversial, as the American countries had been led to
   understand that the World Cup would rotate between the two continents.
   Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the tournament.

   After the 1958 FIFA World Cup, to avoid any future boycotts or
   controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the
   Americas and Europe, which continued until the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The
   2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by Japan and South Korea, was the
   first one held in Asia (and the only tournament with multiple hosts),
   and in 2010, South Africa will become the first African nation to host
   the World Cup.

   The host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's executive committee.
   This is done under a single transferable vote system. The decision is
   currently made six years in advance of the tournament. For the 2010 and
   2014 World Cups, the hosting of the final tournaments was rotated
   between its constituent confederations, and only countries from the
   chosen confederation may bid on the tournament.

   After the 2010 FIFA World Cup was allocated to Africa, the 2014 FIFA
   World Cup was allocated to South America in 2003, which will be the
   first held in South America since 1978. This allowed the ten member
   nations of CONMEBOL to bid as host, but in 2004, the CONMEBOL
   associations voted unanimously to adopt Brazil as their sole candidate,
   creating the odd situation where the 2014 World Cup host was
   unofficially determined. However, it is not yet certain that Brazil
   will be able to host the competition, given the current status of their
   stadiums. There has been discussion of a proposed bid by Chile and
   Argentina to co-host the tournament as did Korea/Japan in 2002, and
   Colombia has also recently suggested they will bid to host the 2014
   World Cup. Otherwise, the tournament may be moved to another continent.
   Recently, FIFA president Sepp Blatter indicated that "Brazil is likely
   to be the host", but also said that "I can't guarantee that Brazil will
   be the host, but the ball is on Brazil's court now."." The final
   decision is expected to be made in 2008.

   The 2018 FIFA World Cup has not been allocated to any continent; in
   fact, the policy of continental rotation may not continue beyond 2014.
   Countries which have expressed an interest in hosting the 2018 World
   Cup include Australia, England, Mexico, Spain and Portugal. The Benelux
   countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) are planning a
   joint bid for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, after Belgium and the
   Netherlands successfully co-hosted the 2000 UEFA European Football
   Championship.

   Map of countries' best results

   In all, 78 nations have qualified at least once for the World Cup
   Finals. Of these, only eleven have made it to the final match, and only
   seven have won. The seven national teams that have won the World Cup
   have added stars to the crest, located on their shirt, with each star
   representing a World Cup victory.

   With five titles, Brazil is the most successful World Cup team and also
   the only nation to have participated in every World Cup Finals so far.
   Italy follows with four titles, including the most recent one in 2006.
   Brazil and Italy are also the only nations to have won consecutive
   titles, each winning their first two titles back-to-back (Italy: 1934
   and 1938; Brazil: 1958 and 1962). In 1970 and 1994, Brazil and Italy
   were finalists, each having a chance to become the first team to win a
   third title (and allowing them to keep the Jules Rimet trophy
   permanently) and a fourth title respectively. Brazil won both matches,
   and added a record fifth title in 2002.

   Brazil and Germany are the only two teams ever to appear in three
   consecutive World Cup final matches (1994, 1998, 2002 and 1982, 1986,
   1990, respectively). Brazil won two out of the three (1994, 2002) and
   Germany won only one (1990; all three appearances as West Germany). Of
   the eighteen World Cup final matches, only twice have the same two
   teams contested the match. Brazil and Italy played in 1970 and 1994,
   and West Germany and Argentina in 1986 and 1990. Every final match has
   also featured one of Brazil, Italy, Germany, and Argentina.

   Below is a list of the 24 teams that have finished in the top four in a
   World Cup. Germany lead all nations with 11 top four finishes. Brazil
   and Germany are tied for most appearances in the final match with seven
   each.

Performances by host nations

   Six of the seven champions have won one of their titles while playing
   in their own homeland, the exception being Brazil, who lost the
   deciding match (known as Maracanazo) when they hosted the 1950
   tournament.

   England ( 1966) and France ( 1998) won their only titles while playing
   as host nations. Uruguay ( 1930), Italy ( 1934) and Argentina ( 1978)
   won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again,
   while Germany ( 1974) won their second cup title on home soil.

   Other nations have also been successful during their spell as hosts.
   Sweden (runners-up in 1958), Chile (third place in 1962), South Korea
   (fourth place in 2002), Mexico (quarterfinals in 1970 and 1986) and
   Japan (second round in 2002) all have their best results when serving
   as hosts. In fact, all host nations have progressed at least beyond the
   first round. The success of the host in the Cup is a major reason why
   nations actively lobby to be selected as hosts, as they seek to gain
   the advantage of a supportive crowd.

Best performances by continental zones

   To date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by European
   and South American teams. The two continents have won nine titles
   apiece. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever
   reached the semi-finals of the competition: the USA (in 1930) and South
   Korea (in 2002). African teams have had some success of late but have
   never reached the semi-finals. Oceania have only been represented in
   the World Cup three times, and only once did a Oceanian team reached
   the second round.

   Interestingly, all World Cups won by European teams have taken place in
   Europe. The only non-European team to win in Europe is Brazil in 1958.
   Only twice had consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same
   continent - when Italy and Brazil successfully defended their titles in
   1938 and 1962 respectively.
   Confederation (continent) Best performance
   UEFA (Europe) 9 titles, won by Italy (4), Germany (3), England (1), and
   France (1)
   CONMEBOL (South America) 9 titles, won by Brazil (5), Argentina (2),
   and Uruguay (2)
   CONCACAF (North, Central America and the Caribbean) Semifinal ( USA,
   1930)
   AFC (Asia) Fourth place ( South Korea, 2002)
   CAF (Africa) Quarterfinal ( Cameroon, 1990; Senegal, 2002)
   OFC (Oceania) Second Round ( Australia, 2006)

Awards

   At the end of each World Cup finals tournament, awards are presented to
   the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team
   positions in the tournament. There are currently six awards:
     * The adidas Golden Shoe for the top goalscorer (formerly called the
       Golden Shoe, or sometimes, the Golden Boot, first awarded in 1930);
     * The adidas Golden Ball for the best player (formerly called the
       Golden Ball, first awarded in 1982);
     * The Yashin Award for the best goalkeeper (first awarded in 1994);
     * The FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the team with the best record of fair
       play (first awarded in 1978);
     * The Most Entertaining Team award for the team that has entertained
       the public the most during the World Cup, as determined by a poll
       of the general public (first awarded in 1994);
     * The Gillette Best Young Player award for the best player at most 21
       years of age at the start of the calendar year (first awarded in
       2006).

   An All-Star Team comprising of the best players of the tournament is
   also announced for each tournament since 1998.
