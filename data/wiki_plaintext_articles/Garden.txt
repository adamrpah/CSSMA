   A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the
   display, cultivation, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of
   nature. The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials.
   The most common form is known as a residential garden. Western gardens
   are almost universally based around plants. Zoos, which display wild
   animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological
   gardens. Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen
   gardens, use plants sparsely or not at all. Food-producing gardens are
   distinguished from farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive
   methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby rather than produce
   for sale). The gardening article discusses the differences and
   similarities between gardens and farms in greater detail.

   Gardening is the activity of growing and maintaining the garden. This
   work is done by an amateur or professional gardener. A gardener might
   also work in a non-garden setting, such as a park, a roadside
   embankment, or other public space. Landscape architecture is a related
   professional activity with landscape architects tending to specialise
   in design for public and corporate clients.

Garden planning and design

   Garden planning and garden design may be undertaken by a professional.
   A landscape architect is a professional who can plan and realise
   outdoor spaces. A garden designer is usually trained to plan and
   realise residential gardens.

   The planner must give consideration to many factors:
     * Purpose
     * Existing conditions
     * Financial constraints
     * Maintenance implications
