   The Harley-Davidson Motor Company ( NYSE: HOG) is an American
   manufacturer of motorcycles based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United
   States. It is one of the two remaining American mass-producers of
   motorcycles (along with Victory Motorcycles). The company emphasizes
   heavy bikes designed for cruising and known for their distinctive
   exhaust note.

   Harley-Davidson motorcycles (popularly known as "Harleys") are
   distinctive in both design and sound. Harley-Davidson motorcycles
   attract a loyal following (in marketing terms, the owners form a brand
   community).

   The Motor Company supplies many domestic police forces with their
   motorcycle fleets. Harleys are especially noted for the tradition of
   heavy customization that gave rise to the chopper-style of motorcycle.
   It also licenses its logo, which is a profitable side business ($41
   million of revenue in 2004, or almost 5% of net income).

   Since 1998 Harley-Davidson has also owned Buell Motorcycle Company.

The Harley-Davidson V-twin engine

   The classic Harley-Davidson engines are two- cylinder, V-twin engines
   with the pistons placed at a 45 degree angle. The crankshaft has a
   single pin, and both pistons are connected to this pin through their
   connecting rods. This design causes the pistons to fire at uneven
   intervals.

   On the V-twin, the sequence is as follows:
    1. the first piston fires (this is the 0° position)
    2. the other piston fires at 315° into the stroke
    3. there is a 405° gap (as both cylinders go through their exhaust
       stroke) until the first piston fires again

   This design, which is covered under several United States patents,
   gives the Harley-Davidson V-twin its unique "potato-potato" sound.

   On 1 February 1994, the company filed a trademark application for the
   distinctive sound of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine: "The mark
   consists of the exhaust sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by
   V-twin, common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use".
   Nine of Harley-Davidson's competitors filed comments opposing the
   application, arguing that cruiser-style motorcycles of various brands
   use a single-crankpin V-twin engine which produce a similar sound.
   These objections were followed by litigation. After six years,
   Harley-Davidson withdrew their trademark application.

Model designations

   Harley model designations are a sequence of letters and numbers,
   combined in limited ways. The sequences can be long, as in the 2006
   model designation FLHTCUSE.

   The first letter may be one of the following:

          E, F, J, U, V (Big Twin), D, G, R, W (Small Twin), X
          (Sportster), or V (VRSC)

   Letters are appended singly or in pairs, as follows:

          B (Belt Drive), C (Classic or Custom), D (Dyna Glide), DG (Disk
          Glide), E (Electric start), F (Fat Boy (1990-present) or
          Foot-shift (1972 and prior)), H (High compression), L (Hydra
          Glide forks), LR (Low Rider), P (Police), R (Race or
          Rubber-mount), S (Sport or Springer), SB (Single belt final
          drive), ST ( Softail), T (Touring), WG (Wide Glide), I (Fuel
          injection), SE (Screamin’ Eagle), U (Ultra)

   Custom Vehicle Operations models can also have a number (2,3,4) added.

   Note that these conventions for model designations are broken regularly
   by the company.

Model families

   Modern Harley-branded motorcycles fall into one of six model families:
   Touring, Softail, Dyna, FXR, Sportster, and VRSC (or V-Rod). Model
   families are primarily distinguished by the model frame. Some are also
   distinguished by engine, suspension, and other characteristics.

Touring

   The touring family, also known as "dressers", includes three Road King
   models, and five Glide models offered in various trim. The Road Kings
   have a "retro cruiser" appearance and most models are equipped with a
   large clear windshield. Road Kings are reminiscent of big-twin models
   from the 1940s and '50s. Glides can be identified by their full front
   fairings. Most Glides sport a unique fairing referred to as the
   "Batwing" due to its unmistakeable shape. Touring models are
   distinguishable by their large luggage, rear coil-over air suspension
   and are the only models to offer full fairings with Radios/CBs.

Softail

   These big-twin motorcycles capitalize on Harley's strong value on
   tradition. With the rear-wheel suspension invisible on the bottom of
   the frame, they are visibly similar to the "hardtail" choppers popular
   in the 1960s and '70s, as well as from their own earlier history. In
   keeping with that tradition, Harley offers Softail models with
   "springer" front ends and "heritage" styling that incorporate design
   cues from throughout their history.

Dyna

   Dyna motorcycles feature big-twin engines and traditional styling. They
   can be distinguished from the Softail by the traditional coil-over
   suspension that connects the swingarm to the frame, and from the
   Sportster by their larger engines. On these models, the transmission
   also houses the engine's oil reservoir.

   In 2007, Harley-Davidson released a line-up of five Dyna models: Super
   Glide, Super Glide Custom, Street Bob, Low Rider, and Wide Glide.

FXR

   The FXR frame was effectively replaced by the Dyna frame in 1995, but
   was revived in special limited editions in 1999 and 2000.

Sportster

   Introduced in 1957, the Sportster is the longest-running model family
   in the Harley-Davidson lineup. They were conceived as racing
   motorcycles, and were popular on dirt and flat-track race courses
   through the 1960s and '70s. Smaller and lighter than the other Harley
   models, they make use of 883 or 1200cc engines and, though often
   modified, remain similar in appearance to their racing ancestors.

   In 2007, Harley Davidson celebrated the 50th anniversary of the
   Sportster and produced a collectors' edition called the XL50 1200
   Custom, of which only 2000 were made for sale world wide. Each
   motorcycle is individually numbered and the colors came in two versions
   (Mirage Pearl Orange and Vivid Black).

VRSC

   Introduced in 2001, the VRSC family bears little resemblance to
   Harley's more traditional lineup. Competing against Japanese and
   American musclebikes, the "V-Rod" makes use of a new Porsche-designed
   engine that, for the first time in Harley history, incorporates fuel
   injection, overhead cams, and liquid cooling. It is visually
   distinctive, easily identified by the hydroformed frame members that
   support the round-topped fuel tank. Based on the VR-1000 racing
   motorcycle, it continues to be a platform around which Harley-Davidson
   builds drag-racing competition machines.

History

Company founding

   The company considers 1903 to be its year of founding, though the
   Harley-Davidson enterprise could be considered to have started in 1901
   when William S. Harley, age 21, drew up plans for a small engine that
   displaced 7.07 cubic inches (116 cc) and had four-inch flywheels. The
   engine was designed for use in a regular pedal-bicycle frame.

   Over the next two years Harley and his boyhood friend Arthur Davidson
   labored on their motor-bicycle using the northside machine shop of
   their friend Henry Melk. It was finished in 1903 with the help of
   Arthur's brother, Walter Davidson. Upon completion the boys found their
   power-cycle unable to conquer Milwaukee's modest hills without pedal
   assistance. Will Harley and the Davidsons quickly wrote off their first
   motor-bicycle as a valuable learning experiment.

   Work was immediately begun on a new and improved machine. This first
   "real" Harley-Davidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of 24.74 cubic
   inches (405 cc) with 9-3/4 inch flywheels weighing 28 pounds. The
   machine's advanced loop-frame was similar to the 1903 Milwaukee Merkel
   motorcycle. They also got help with their new engine from outboard
   motor pioneer Ole Evinrude. Elder brother William A. Davidson also lent
   a hand.

   The prototype of the new improved loop-frame model was assembled in a
   10 by 15 foot (3 by 5 meter) shed in the Davidson family backyard. The
   machine was functional by 8 September 1904 when it was entered in a
   Milwaukee motorcycle race, the first known appearance of a
   Harley-Davidson motorcycle.

   In January 1905 small advertisements were placed in the "Automobile and
   Cycle Trade Journal" that offered bare Harley-Davidson engines to the
   do-it-yourself trade. By April, complete motorcycles were in production
   on a very limited basis. In 1905 no more than a dozen machines were
   built in the backyard shed. (Some years later the original shed was
   taken to the Juneau Avenue factory where it would stand for many
   decades as a tribute to the Motor Company's humble origins.
   Unfortunately, the first shed was accidentally destroyed by contractors
   in the early 1970s during a clean-up of the factory yard.)

   In 1906 Harley and the Davidsons built their first factory on Chestnut
   Street (later Juneau Avenue). This location remains the Motor Company's
   corporate headquarters today. The first Juneau Avenue plant was a
   modest 40 by 60 foot single-story wooden structure. That year around 50
   motorcycles were produced.

   In 1907 William S. Harley graduated from the University of
   Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in mechanical engineering. That year
   additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with
   facings and additions of Milwaukee pale yellow ("cream") brick. With
   the new facilities production increased to 150 motorcycles in 1907.
   That September a milestone was reached when the fledgling company was
   officially incorporated. They also began selling their motorcycles to
   police departments around this time, a tradition that continues today.

   Production in 1905 and 1906 were all single-cylinder models with 26.84
   cubic inch (440 cc) engines but as early as February of 1907 a
   prototype model with a 45-degree V-Twin engine was displayed at the
   Chicago Automobile Show. Although shown and advertised, very few dual
   cylinder V-Twin models were built between 1907 and 1910. These first
   V-Twins displaced 53.68 cubic inches (880 cc) and produced about 7
   horsepower (5 kW). This gave about double the hill-climbing power of
   the first singles. Top speed was about 60 mph (97 km/h). Production
   jumped from 450 motorcycles in 1908 to 1,149 machines in 1909.

   The success of Harley-Davidson (along with Indian's success) had
   attracted many imitators. By 1911 some 150 makes of motorcycles had
   already been built in the United States -- although just a handful
   would survive the 1910s.

   In 1911 an improved V-Twin model with mechanically operated intake
   valves was introduced. (Earlier V-Twins had used "automatic" intake
   valves that opened by engine vacuum). Displacing 49.48 cubic inches
   (810 cc), the 1911 V-Twin was actually smaller than earlier twins, but
   gave better performance. After 1913 the majority of bikes produced by
   Harley-Davidson would be V-Twin models.

   By 1913 the yellow brick factory had been demolished and on the site a
   new 5-story structure of reinforced concrete and red brick had been
   built. Begun in 1910, the red brick factory with its many additions
   would take up two blocks along Juneau Avenue and around the corner on
   38th Street. Despite the competition, Harley-Davidson was already
   pulling ahead of Indian and would dominate motorcycle racing after
   1914. Production that year swelled to 16,284 machines.

World War I

   In 1917, the United States was drawn into World War I and the military
   demanded motorcycles for the war effort. Harleys had already been used
   by the military in border skirmishes with Pancho Villa but World War I
   was the first time the motorcycle had been adopted for combat service.
   Harley-Davidson provided over 20,000 machines to the military forces
   during World War I.

   By 1920, Harley-Davidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the
   world. Their motorcycles were sold by dealers in 67 countries.
   Production was 28,189 machines.

   In 1921, a milestone was reached in motorcycle racing. A
   Harley-Davidson machine was the very first to win a race at an average
   speed of over 100 mph (160 km/h).

   During the 1920s, several improvements were put in place, such as a new
   74 cubic inch (1.2 L) V-Twin, introduced in 1922, and the gas tank
   still seen today, called a "Teardrop" tank, in 1925. A front brake was
   added in 1928.

World War II

   One of only two American cycle manufacturers to survive the Great
   Depression, Harley-Davidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles
   for the US Army in World War II and resumed civilian production
   afterwards, producing a range of large V-twin motorcycles that were
   successful both on racetracks and for private buyers.

   Harley Davidson, on the eve World War II, was already supplying the
   Army with a military-specific version of its 45" WLD line, called the
   WLA. (The A in this case stood for "Army".) Upon the outbreak of war,
   the company, along with other manufacturing enterprises, shifted to war
   work. Over 90,000 military motorcycles, mostly WLAs and WLCs (the
   Canadian version) would be produced, many to be provided to allies.
   Shipments to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease program numbered at
   least 30,000. The WLAs produced during all years of war production
   would, unusually, have 1942 serial numbers. Production of the WLA
   stopped at the end of the war, though it would resume production from
   1949 to 1952 due to the Korean War.

   The U.S. Army also asked Harley-Davidson to produce a new motorcycle
   with many of the features of BMW's side-valve and shaft-driven R71.
   Harley largely copied the BMW engine and drive train and produced the
   shaft-driven 750cc 1942 Harley-Davidson XA. Due to the superior cooling
   of an opposed twin, Harley's XA cylinder heads ran 100° cooler than its
   V-twins'. The XA never entered full production: the motorcycle by that
   time had been eclipsed by the Jeep as the Army's general purpose
   vehicle, and the WLA—already in production—was sufficient for its
   limited police, escort, and courier roles. Only 1,000 were made and the
   XA never went into full production. It remains the only shaft-driven
   Harley Davidson ever made.

   As part of war reparations, Harley-Davidson acquired the design of a
   small German motorcycle, the DKW RT125 which they adapted and marketed
   as the "Hummer" from 1948 to 1966 (in in the UK, BSA took the same
   design as the foundation of their BSA Bantam).

Tarnished reputation

   In 1952, following their application to the US Tariff Commission for a
   40% tax on imported motorcycles, Harley-Davidson is charged with
   restrictive practices.

   In 1969, American Machinery and Foundry (AMF) bought the company,
   streamlined production, and slashed the workforce. This tactic resulted
   in a labor strike and a lower quality of bikes. The company also ceased
   to be an innovator in the motorcycle industry, with a design that
   remained basically unchanged for many years. The bikes were expensive
   and inferior in performance, handling, and quality to Japanese
   motorcycles. Sales declined, quality plummeted, and the company almost
   went bankrupt. The venerable name of "Harley-Davidson" was mocked as
   "Hardly Ableson", and the nickname "Hog" became pejorative.

Leadership regained

   In 1981, AMF sold the company to a group of thirteen investors led by
   Vaughn Beals and Willie G. Davidson for $80 million. Inventory was
   strictly controlled using the Just In Time system.

   Rather than trying to match the Japanese, this new management
   deliberately exploited the "retro" appeal of the machines, building
   motorcycles that deliberately adopted the look and feel of their
   earlier machines and the subsequent customizations of owners of that
   era. Many components such as brakes, forks, shocks, carburetors,
   electrics and wheels were outsourced from foreign manufacturers and
   quality increased, technical improvements were made, and buyers slowly
   returned. To remain profitable Harley continues to increase the amount
   of overseas made parts it uses, while being careful not to harm its
   valuable "American Made" image.

   The " Sturgis" model, boasting a dual belt-drive, was introduced. By
   1990, with the introduction of the "Fat Boy", Harley once again became
   the sales leader in the heavyweight (over 750 cc) market. There was a
   controversy that the Fat Boy model was allegedly inspired by the name
   of the bombs ( Fat Man and Little Boy) that were dropped on Nagasaki
   and Hiroshima. The company vehemently denies this and claims it is
   coincidence.

   In 1999, Ford Motor Company added a Harley-Davidson edition to the Ford
   F-Series F-150 line, complete with the Harley-Davidson logo. This truck
   was an extended-cab for model year 1999. In 2000, Ford changed the
   truck to a crew cab and in 2002 added a super-charged engine (5.4L)
   which continued until 2003. In 2004, the Ford/Harley was changed to a
   Super-Duty, which continues through 2006. Ford will again produced a
   Harley-Davidson Edition F-150 for their 2006 model-year, as well.

   Building started on $75 million 130,000 square-foot (12,000 m^2)
   Harley-Davidson Museum in the Menomonee Valley on June 1, 2006. It is
   expected to open in 2008 and will house the company's vast collection
   of historic motorcycles and corporate archives, along with a
   restaurant, café and meeting space.

Origin of Hog nickname

   Beginning in 1920 a team that consistently won races had a hog, a pig,
   as their mascot. Following a win, they would put the pig (a real one)
   on the back of their Harley and take a victory lap. A photo of the pig
   is also on their website. In 1983, an organization was formed, taking
   advantage of the long-standing nickname by turning "hog" into the
   acronym H.O.G., for Harley Owners Group.

   Harley-Davidson attempted to trademark "hog," but in 1999 ultimately
   lost the case, with the appellate panel ruling that "hog" had become a
   generic term for large motorcycles, and is therefore unprotectable as a
   trademark.

   On August 15th 2006 Harley Davidson Inc. had its NYSE ticker changed
   from HDI to HOG.

Events

   In 2003, Harley-Davidson Company celebrated its 100th birthday. On
   Labor Day weekend the city of Milwaukee hosted the largest
   Harley-Davidson event, and possibly the largest motorcycle event, in
   history.

   The Harley-Davidson Riders Club of Gt Britain
   www.harley-davidson-hangout.com (est 1949) was the first British riders
   club (as opposed to motorcycle club and organised national rallies and
   ride-outs from the outset. The 1982 rally began a popular run of
   events, probably due to the good fortune of having William G. Davidson
   attending his first rally outside the USA, in Great Britain. He is
   thought to have been more than curious to discover how the secret
   "Evolution Motor" had found its world exclusive on the cover of the
   spring edition of the HDRCGB magazine, the "Harleyquin", but having a
   forgiving nature, Willie G. returned in 1984, along with Vaughn Beals
   and Len Thomson to officially show off the Evolution engine by bringing
   a test ride fleet to the second Brighton Super Rally. The demonstration
   rides were the first at any European Rally, and it was following Willie
   G's visit to this event that HOG came into being in the USA, so perhaps
   a seed had been sown.

   Harley-Davidson established the Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.) in 1983 in
   response to a growing desire by a new breed of Harley riders for an
   organized way to share their passion and show their pride. By 1985, 49
   local chapters existed, with a membership of 60,000.

   Rapid growth continued into the 1990s, and in 1991 H.O.G. officially
   went international, with the first official European H.O.G. Rally in
   Cheltenham, England. Worldwide membership numbered 151,600, with 685
   local chapters.

   As the 90s continued, H.O.G. spread into Asia, including new chapters
   in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. By 1999, worldwide membership
   had reached half a million, and the number of local chapters totaled
   1,157. Today, more than one million members make H.O.G. the largest
   factory-sponsored motorcycle organization in the world.

   H.O.G. benefits include organized group rides, exclusive products and
   product discounts, insurance premium discounts, and the Hog Tales
   newsletter.

   Famous owners of Harley-Davidsons include singer Elvis Presley,
   comedian Jay Leno and professional wrestler The Undertaker Here is a

Harley Davidson in popular culture
