   Suriname, officially the Republiek Suriname, is a country in northern
   South America. Other common names are Surinam or Sranang. It was
   formerly known as Nederlands Guyana, Netherlands Guiana or Dutch
   Guiana. It lies in between French Guiana to the east and Guyana to the
   west. The southern border is shared with Brazil and the northern border
   is the Atlantic coast. The most southern parts of the borders with
   Guyana and French Guiana are disputed (upper Corantijn and Marowijne
   rivers—the map shows the Guyana and French Guiana versions of the
   border).

   Suriname is the least populated independent country in South America.
   It is also the smallest nation in area on the continent.

History

   Native Americans of the Arawak and Carib tribes were the first to
   inhabit Suriname in 3000 BC. In the 17th century, there were several
   attempts by the Dutch and English to colonize Suriname, with the Dutch
   eventually gaining stable control. The Netherlands, and therefore
   Suriname, had a system of slave labour, with slaves mostly of African
   decent. The treatment of these slaves was bad, and many slaves escaped
   to the jungle. These Maroons (also known as "Djukas" or "Bakabusi
   Nengre") often returned to attack the plantations. Slave labour was
   only abolished in 1863, making it the last European country to do so.
   However, slaves were not released until 1873. After that, labourers
   were imported from the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia). In 1954
   Suriname gained self-government, with the Netherlands retaining control
   of defence and foreign affairs. In 1973, the local government, led by
   the NPK (a largely Creole party) started negotiations with the Dutch
   government about independence, which was granted at 25 November 1975.
   The first President of the country was Johan Ferrier, with Henck Arron
   (leader of the Surinam National Party) as Prime Minister. Roughly a
   third of the population emigrated to the Netherlands, fearing that the
   new country would not be able to survive. A series of military coups in
   1980 lead to the breakdown in Dutch-Suriname relations, but elections
   were held and a new constitution written in 1987. A coup in 1990
   interrupted this, but elections were held again in 1991. With
   democracy, the Dutch government resumed aid. Since 1990, the four-party
   New Front coalition, led by Ronald Venetiaan has held government. In
   recent years, developing the economy has been one of the most difficult
   issues for Suriname.

   Suriname has recently sent their army into Nickerie to prevent the
   possible crossing over of Guyanese due to fears of election violence.
   However, the Guyana elections on August 28, 2006 were quite peaceful
   and free from violence.

Administrative divisions

   Suriname is divided into ten districts:
    1. Brokopondo
    2. Commewijne
    3. Coronie
    4. Marowijne
    5. Nickerie
    6. Para
    7. Paramaribo
    8. Saramacca
    9. Sipaliwini
   10. Wanica

   Suriname is further subdivided into 62 resorts.

Geography

   Suriname is the smallest independent country in South America. Situated
   on the Guiana Shield, the country can be divided into two main
   geographic regions. The northern, lowland coastal area (roughly above
   the line Albina-Paranam-Wageningen) has been cultivated, and most of
   the population lives here. The southern part consists of tropical
   rainforest and sparsely inhabited savanna along the border with Brazil,
   covering about 80% of Suriname's land surface.

   There are two main mountain ranges in Suriname: the Bakhuis Mountains
   and the Van Asch Van Wijck Mountains. Julianatop is the highest
   mountain in the country at 1,286 metres (4,219 ft) above sea level.
   Other mountains include Tafelberg (1,026  m; 3,366  ft), Mount
   Kasikasima (718 m; 2,356 ft), Goliathberg (358 m; 1,174 ft) and
   Voltzberg (240 m; 787 ft).

   Lying near the equator, Suriname has a tropical climate, and
   temperatures do not vary a lot throughout the year. The year has two
   wet seasons, from December to early February and from late April to
   mid-August.

   Located in the northeast portion of the country is the W.J. van
   Blommestein Meer, one of the largest reservoir lakes in the world. It
   was created in 1964 by the Afobakka dam (Brokopondo project), built to
   provide hydro power for the bauxite industry (which consumes about 75%
   of the output) and for domestic consumption.

   In the upper Coppename River watershed, the Central Suriname Nature
   Reserve is a UNESCO World Heritage Site cited for its unspoiled
   rainforest biodiversity. There are many national parks in the country:
   Galibi National Reserve, Coppename Manding National Park and Wia Wia NR
   along the coast, Brownsberg NR, Raleighvallen/Voltzeberg NR, Tafelberg
   NR and Eilerts de Haan NP in the centre and the Sipaliwani NR on the
   Brazilian border. In all, 12% of the country's land area are national
   parks and lakes.

Economy

   The economy of Suriname is dominated by the bauxite industry, which
   accounts for more than 15% of GDP and 70% of export earnings. Other
   main export products include sugar, and Suriname has some oil and gold
   reserves. About a quarter of the people work in the agricultural
   sector. The Surinamese economy is very dependent on other countries,
   with its main trade partners being the Netherlands, the United States
   and countries in the Caribbean.

   After assuming power in the fall of 1996, the Wijdenbosch government
   ended the structural adjustment program of the previous government,
   claiming it was unfair to the poorer elements of society. Tax revenues
   fell as old taxes lapsed and the government failed to implement new tax
   alternatives. By the end of 1997, the allocation of new Dutch
   development funds was frozen as Surinamese Government relations with
   the Netherlands deteriorated. Economic growth slowed in 1998, with
   decline in the mining, construction, and utility sectors. Rampant
   government expenditures, poor tax collection, a bloated civil service,
   and reduced foreign aid in 1999 contributed to the fiscal deficit,
   estimated at 11% of GDP. The government sought to cover this deficit
   through monetary expansion, which led to a dramatic increase in
   inflation and exchange rate depreciation.

Demographics

   Suriname's population of 438,144 (July 2005 est.) is made up of several
   distinct ethnic groups. East Indians (known locally as Hindoestanen or
   Hindus) form the largest group at 37% of the population. They are
   descendants of 19th century immigrants from India. They are from the
   Indian states of Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh, in Northern India,
   along the Nepalese border. The Creoles, mixed white and black, form
   about 31%, while the Javanese ("imported" from the former Dutch East
   Indies) make up 15%. Maroons (descendants of escaped African slaves)
   make up 10% and are divided into five main groups: Aucans, Kwinti,
   Matawi, Paramaccans and Saramaccans. Amerindians form 3% of the
   population (some say as low as 1%), the main groups being the Akuriyo,
   Arawak, Carib/ Kaliña, Trío and Wayana. The remainder is formed by
   Chinese, Europeans, and Brazilian immigrant workers that have arrived
   in Suriname in recent times. A small Jewish community composed of about
   200 people, descendants of Sephardim who had earlier fled from Iberia
   to the Netherlands, also inhabits the country, mostly in Paramaribo;
   they have been supplied with the requirements for Passover by the World
   Jewish Congress since the 1980s. They previously operated an autonomous
   region of Suriname called the " Jodensavanne", which in the mid-17th
   century was one of the largest Jewish communities in the Western
   Hemisphere.

   Because of the great number of ethnic groups in the country, there is
   no one main religion. Most of the Hindustani are Hindu, but Islam and
   Christianity are also practised by them. Christianity, both in the form
   of Roman Catholicism and variations of Protestantism, is dominant among
   Creoles and Maroons.

   Dutch is the official language of Suriname. The Surinamese also speak
   their own languages: Sranang Tongo (also known as Surinaams). This is
   an English creole with a large influence from Dutch and several other
   languages, including SPanish, Portuguese, West African languages and
   several indigenous languages. Also, the original Carib and Arawak
   Amerindians of Suriname speak their own languages, as do the Maroons;
   Aucan (n'Djuka or Ndjukas) and Saramaccan. The second largest language
   of the nation is Sarnami Hindustani, a form of Bihari, which is a
   dialect of modern India's Hindi language. Additionally, English and
   Spanish are also widely used, especially at tourist-oriented facilities
   or shops.

   The vast majority of people (about 90%) live in Paramaribo or on the
   coast. There is also a significant Surinamese population in the
   Netherlands. In 2004 there were 321,000 Surinamese people living in the
   Netherlands, which is about 2% of the total population of the
   Netherlands (compared to 449 000 in Suriname).
