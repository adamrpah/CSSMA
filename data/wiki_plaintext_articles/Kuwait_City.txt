   Kuwait City (Arabic: مدينة الكويت, transliteration: Madīnat al-Kūwait),
   is the capital city of Kuwait. It has an estimated population of 32,500
   (2005 estimate) within city limits and 2.38 million in the metropolitan
   area. Located at the heart of the country on the shore of the Persian
   Gulf, and containing Kuwait's parliament ( Majlis Al-Umma), most
   governmental offices, the headquarters of most Kuwaiti corporations and
   banks, it is the indisputable political, cultural and economical centre
   of the emirate.

   Kuwait City's trade and transportation needs are served by Kuwait
   International Airport, Mina Al-Shuwaik (Shuwaik Port) and Mina
   al-Ahmadi (Ahmadi Port) 50 kilometers to the south, on the Persian Gulf
   coast.

   Kuwait City is located at 29°22'11" North, 47°58'42" East (29.369722,
   47.978333) .

History

   The city was invaded and seized by Iraqi forces in the 1990 Gulf War.
   Under Iraqi occupation it was renamed "Al Kadhima" (apparently an older
   name for the town^1) in order to erase Kuwaiti identity. It returned to
   its original name once Iraqi troops were expelled.

   During the invasion, the city was extensively bombed and damaged.
   Buildings were fired upon, set alight, and demolished; roads and
   bridges links were the targets of explosives, and landmarks were
   defaced. The Kuwait National Museum, for example, which once held an
   extensive, comprehensive, and beautiful collection of artwork, was
   looted and then torched. The Kuwait Towers, the symbols of the country,
   were the targets of Saddam Hussein, who aimed to demolish them. Only
   minor damage was done to the Towers, and they are still the nation's
   symbol.

   After the invasion, foreign investors and the Kuwaiti government were
   actively involved in modernizing the city and transforming it into a
   world-class, state-of-the-art business hub. Today, virtually all traces
   of the invasion have been cleared, and construction cranes dot the
   skyline. Many new hotels, including an exclusive Four Seasons and
   InterContinental, are now under construction, indicating the recent
   economic growth spur. The city contains many new buildings and shopping
   malls with modern designs. Some tourists are already present in the
   city, most of them looking for a relaxing beach getaway.
