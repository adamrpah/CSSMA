   The Redwing (Turdus iliacus) is a member of the thrush family Turdidae.

   It breeds in conifer and birch forest and tundra in northern Europe and
   Asia. It is strongly migratory, with many northern birds moving south
   during the winter. It is a very rare breeder in Great Britain and
   Ireland, but winters in large numbers in these countries.

   Redwings nest in shrubs or on the ground, laying several eggs in a neat
   nest. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks,
   often with fieldfares.
   Redwings often construct their nests on the ground.

   Redwings often construct their nests on the ground.

   The Redwing is similar in size to the Song Thrush. It is omnivorous,
   eating a wide range of insects and earthworms in summer, and berries in
   winter.

   The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and streaked white
   underparts. The most striking identification features are the red
   flanks and underwing, and the white stripe above the eye.

   The male has a varied short song, and a whistling flight call.
