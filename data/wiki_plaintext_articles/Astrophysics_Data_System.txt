Astrophysics Data System

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Space (Astronomy)

   The NASA Astrophysics Data System (usually referred to as ADS) is an
   online database of over 5,000,000 astronomy and physics papers from
   both peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed sources. Abstracts are
   available for free online for all articles, and full scanned articles
   are available in GIF and PDF format for older articles. New articles
   have links to electronic versions hosted at the journal's webpage, but
   these are typically available only by subscription (which most
   astronomy research facilities have).

   ADS is an extremely powerful research tool, and has had a significant
   impact on the efficiency of astronomical research since it was launched
   in 1992. Literature searches which previously would have taken days or
   weeks can now be carried out in seconds, via the sophisticated ADS
   search engine, which is custom-built for astronomical needs. Studies
   have found that the benefit to astronomy of the ADS is equivalent to
   several hundred million US dollars annually, and the system is
   estimated to have tripled the readership of astronomical journals.

   Use of ADS is almost universal among astronomers worldwide, and
   therefore ADS usage statistics can be used to analyse global trends in
   astronomical research. They have revealed that the amount of research
   an astronomer carries out is related to the GDP per capita of the
   country in which they are based and that the number of astronomers in a
   country is proportional to the GDP of that country, so the amount of
   research done in a country is proportional to the square of its GDP
   divided by its population.

History

   For many years, a growing problem in astronomical research was that the
   rising number of papers published in the major astronomical journals
   was increasing steadily, meaning astronomers were able to read less and
   less of the latest research findings. During the 1980s, astronomers saw
   that the nascent technologies which formed the basis of the Internet
   could eventually be used to build an electronic indexing system of
   astronomical research papers which would allow astronomers to keep
   abreast of a much greater range of research.

   The first suggestion of a database of journal paper abstracts was made
   at a conference on Astronomy from Large Data-bases held in Garching bei
   MÃ¼nchen in 1987. Initial development of an electronic system for
   accessing astrophysical abstracts took place during the following two
   years, and in 1991 discussions took place on how to integrate ADS with
   the SIMBAD database, which contains all available catalogue
   designations for objects outside the solar system, to create a system
   where astronomers could search for all the papers written about a given
   object.

   An initial version of ADS, with a database consisting of 40 papers, was
   created as a proof of concept in 1988, and the ADS database was
   successfully connected with the SIMBAD database in the summer of 1993.
   This is believed to have been the first use of the Internet to allow
   simultaneous querying of transatlantic scientific databases. Until
   1994, the service was available via proprietary network software, but
   was transferred to the nascent World Wide Web early that year. The
   number of users of the service quadrupled in the five weeks following
   the introduction of the ADS web-based service.

   At first, the journal articles available via ADS were scanned bitmaps
   created from the paper journals, but from 1995 onwards, the
   Astrophysical Journal began to publish an on-line edition, soon
   followed by the other main journals such as Astronomy and Astrophysics
   and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. ADS provided
   links to these electronic editions from their first appearance. Since
   about 1995, the number of ADS users has doubled roughly every two
   years. ADS now has agreements with almost all astronomical journals,
   who supply abstracts, and scanned articles from as far back as the
   early 19th century are available via the service, which now contains
   over five million documents. The service is now distributed worldwide,
   with twelve mirror sites in twelve countries on five continents, with
   the database synchronised by means of weekly updates using rsync, a
   mirroring utility which allows updates to only the portions of the
   database which have changed. All updates are triggered centrally, but
   they initiate scripts at the mirror sites which 'pull' updated data
   from the main ADS servers.

Data in the system

   1284 papers about M101 are available through ADS, from as long ago as
   1850.

   1284 papers about M101 are available through ADS, from as long ago as
   1850.

   Papers are indexed within the database by their bibliographic record,
   containing the details of the journal they were published in and
   various associated metadata, such as author lists, references and
   citations. Originally this data was stored in ASCII format, but
   eventually the limitations of this encouraged the database maintainers
   to migrate all records to an XML (Extensible Markup Language) format in
   2000. Bibliographic records are now stored as an XML element, with
   sub-elements for the various metadata.

   Since the advent of online editions of journals, abstracts are loaded
   into the ADS on or before the publication date of articles, with the
   full journal text available to subscribers. Older articles have been
   scanned, and an abstract is created using optical character recognition
   software. Scanned articles from before about 1995 are usually available
   for free, by agreement with the journal publishers.

   Scanned articles are stored in TIFF format, at both medium and high
   resolution. The TIFF files are converted on demand into GIF files for
   on-screen viewing, and PDF or PostScript files for printing. The
   generated files are then cached to eliminate needlessly frequent
   regenerations for popular articles. As of 2000, ADS contained 250 GB of
   scans, which consisted of 1,128,955 article pages comprising 138,789
   articles. By 2005 this had grown to 650 GB, and is expected to grow
   further, to about 900 GB by 2007.

   The database initially contained only astronomical references, but has
   now grown to incorporate four database, covering astronomy,
   instrumentation and geophysics references as well as preprints of
   astronomical papers. The astronomy database is by far the most advanced
   and its use accounts for about 85% of the total ADS usage. Articles are
   assigned to the different databases according to the subject rather
   than the journal they are published in, so that articles from any one
   journal might appear in all three subject databases. The separation of
   the databases allows searching in each discipline to be tailored, so
   that words can automatically be given different weight functions in
   different database searches, depending on how common they are in the
   relevant field.

   Data in the preprint archive is updated daily from the arXiv, the main
   repository of physics and astronomy preprints. The advent of preprint
   servers has, like ADS, had a significant impact on the rate of
   astronomical research, as papers are often made available from preprint
   servers weeks or months before they are published in the journals. The
   incorporation of preprints from the arXiv into ADS means that the
   search engine can return the most current research available, with the
   caveat that preprints may not have been peer reviewed or proofread to
   the required standard for publication in the main journals. ADS's
   database links preprints with subsequently published articles wherever
   possible, so that citation and reference searches will return links to
   the journal article where the preprint was cited.

Software and hardware

   The software which runs the system was written specifically for it,
   allowing for extensive customisation to astronomical needs which would
   not have been possible with general purpose database software. The
   scripts are designed to be as platform independent as possible, given
   the need to facilitate mirroring on different systems around the world,
   although the growing dominance of Linux as the operating system of
   choice within astronomy has led to increasing optimisation of the
   scripts for installation on this platform.

   The main ADS server is located at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for
   Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is a single PC with two
   3.6 GHz CPUs and 6 GB of RAM, running the Fedora Core Linux
   distribution. Mirrors are located in Argentina, Brazil, China, Chile,
   France, Germany, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United
   Kingdom.

Indexing

   ADS currently receive abstracts or tables of contents from almost two
   hundred journal sources. The service may receive data referring to the
   same article from multiple sources, and creates one bibliographic
   reference based on the most accurate data from each source. The common
   use of TeX and LaTeX by almost all scientific journals greatly
   facilitates the incorporation of bibliographic data into the system in
   a standardised format, and importing HTML-coded web-based articles is
   also simple. ADS utilises Perl scripts for importing, processing and
   standardising bibliographic data.

   The apparently mundane task of converting author names into a standard
   Surname, Initial format is actually one of the more difficult to
   automate, due to the wide variety of naming conventions around the
   world and the possibility that a given name such as Davis could be a
   first name, middle name or surname. The accurate conversion of names
   requires a detailed knowledge of the names of authors active in
   astronomy, and ADS maintains an extensive database of author names,
   which is also used in searching the database (see below).

   For electronic articles, a list of the references given at the end of
   the article is easily extracted. For scanned articles, reference
   extraction relies on OCR. The reference database can then be 'inverted'
   to list the citations for each paper in the database. Citation lists
   have been used in the past to identify popular articles missing from
   the database; mostly these were from before 1975 and have now been
   added to the system.

Coverage

   The database now contains over four million articles. In the cases of
   the major journals of astronomy ( Astrophysical Journal, Astronomical
   Journal, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Publications of the Astronomical
   Society of the Pacific and the Monthly Notices of the Royal
   Astronomical Society), coverage is complete, with all issues indexed
   from number 1 to the present. These journals account for about
   two-thirds of the papers in the database, with the rest consisting of
   papers published in over 100 other journals from around the world.

   While the database contains the complete contents of all the major
   journals and many minor ones as well, its coverage of references and
   citations is much less complete. References in and citations of
   articles in the major journals are fairly complete, but references such
   as 'private communication', 'in press' or 'in preparation' cannot be
   matched, and author errors in reference listings also introduce
   potential errors. Astronomical papers may cite and be cited by articles
   in journals which fall outside the scope of ADS, such as chemistry,
   maths or biology journals.

Search engine

   Since its inception, the ADS has developed a highly sophisticated
   search engine to query the abstract and object databases. The search
   engine is tailor-made for searching astronomical abstracts, and the
   engine and its user interface assume that the user is well-versed in
   astronomy and able to interpret search results which are designed to
   return more than just the most relevant papers. The database can be
   queried for author names, astronomical object names, title words, and
   words in the abstract text, and results can be filtered according to a
   number of criteria. It works by first gathering synonyms and
   simplifying search terms as described above, and then generating an
   'inverted file', which is a list of all the documents matching each
   search term. The user-selected logic and filters are then applied to
   this inverted list to generate the final search results.

Author name queries

   The system indexes author names by surname and initials, and accounts
   for the possible variations in spelling of names using a list of
   variations. This is common in the case of names including accents such
   as umlauts and transliterations from Arabic or Cyrillic script. An
   example of an entry in the author synonym list is:

          AFANASJEV, V
          AFANASâEV, V
          AFANASâIEV, V
          AFANASEV, V
          AFANASYEV, V
          AFANSâIEV, V
          AFANSEV, V

Object name searches

   The capability to search for papers on specific astronomical objects is
   one of ADS' most powerful tools. The system uses data from the SIMBAD,
   the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database, the International Astronomical
   Union Circulars and the Lunar and Planetary Institute to identify
   papers referring to a given object, and can also search by object
   position, listing papers which concern objects within a 10 arcminute
   radius of a given Right Ascension and Declination. These databases
   combine the many catalogue designations an object might have, so that a
   search for the Pleiades will also find papers which list the famous
   open cluster in Taurus under any of its other catalogue designations or
   popular names, such as M45, the Seven Sisters or Melotte 22.

Title and abstract searches

   The search engine first filters search terms in several ways. An M
   followed by a space or hyphen has the space or hyphen removed, so that
   searching for Messier catalogue objects is simplified and a user input
   of M45, M 45 or M-45 all result in the same query being executed;
   similarly, NGC designations and common search terms such as Shoemaker
   Levy and T Tauri are stripped of spaces. Unimportant words such as AT,
   OR and TO are stripped out, although in some cases case sensitivity is
   maintained, so that while and is ignored, And is converted to '
   Andromedae', and Her is converted to ' Herculis' while her is ignored.

Synonym replacement

   Once search terms have been pre-processed, the database is queried with
   the revised search term, as well as synonyms for it. As well as simple
   synonym replacement such as searching for both plural and singular
   forms, ADS also searches for a large number of specifically
   astronomical synonyms. For example, spectrograph and spectroscope have
   basically the same meaning, and in an astronomical context metallicity
   and abundance are also synonymous. ADS' synonym list was created
   manually, by grouping the list of words in the database according to
   similar meanings.

   As well as English language synonyms, ADS also searches for English
   translations of foreign search terms and vice versa, so that a search
   for the French word soleil retrieves references to Sun, and papers in
   languages other than English can be returned by English search terms.

   Synonym replacement can be disabled if required, so that a rare term
   which is a synonym of a much more common term (such as ' dateline'
   rather than ' date') can be searched for specifically.

Selection logic

   The search engine allows selection logic both within fields and between
   fields. Search terms in each field can be combined with OR, AND, simple
   logic or Boolean logic, and the user can specify which fields must be
   matched in the search results. This allows very complex searches to be
   built up; for example, the user could search for papers concerning NGC
   6543 OR NGC 7009, with the paper titles containing (radius OR velocity)
   AND NOT (abundance OR temperature).

Result filtering

   Search results can be filtered according to a number of criteria,
   including specifying a range of years such as '1945 to 1975', '2000 to
   the present day' or 'before 1900', and what type of journal the article
   appears in â non-peer reviewed articles such as conference proceedings
   can be excluded or specifically searched for, or specific journals can
   be included in or excluded from the search.

Search results

   Although it was conceived as a means of accessing abstracts and papers,
   ADS today provides a substantial amount of ancillary information along
   with search results. For each abstract returned, links are provided to
   other papers in the database which are referenced, and which cite the
   paper, and a link is provided to a preprint, where one exists. The
   system also generates a link to 'also-read' articles â that is, those
   which been most commonly accessed by those reading the article. In this
   way, an ADS user can determine which papers are of most interest to
   astronomers who are interested in the subject of a given paper.

   Also returned are links to the SIMBAD and/or NASA Extragalactic
   Database object name databases, via which a user can quickly find out
   basic observational data about the objects analysed in a paper, and
   find further papers on those objects.

Impact on astronomy

   ADS is an almost universally used research tool among astronomers, and
   its impact on astronomical research is considerable. Several studies
   have estimated quantitatively how much more efficient ADS has made
   astronomy; one estimated that ADS increased the efficiency of
   astronomical research by 333 full-time equivalent research years per
   year, and another found that in 2002 its effect was equivalent to 736
   full-time researchers, or all the astronomical research done in France.
   ADS has allowed literature searches that would previously have taken
   days or weeks to carry out to be completed in seconds, and it is
   estimated that ADS has increased the readership and use of the
   astronomical literature by a factor of about three since its inception.

   In monetary terms, this increase in efficiency represents a
   considerable amount. There are about 12,000 active astronomical
   researchers worldwide, so ADS is the equivalent of about 5% of the
   working population of astronomers. The global astronomical research
   budget is estimated at between 4,000 and 5,000 million USD, so the
   value of ADS to astronomy would be about 200â250 million USD annually.
   Its operating budget is a small fraction of this amount.

   The great importance of ADS to astronomers has been recognised by the
   United Nations, the General Assembly of which has commended ADS on its
   work and success, particularly noting its importance to astronomers in
   the developing world, in reports of the United Nations Committee on the
   Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. A 2002 report by a visiting committee to
   the Centre for Astrophysics, meanwhile, said that the service had
   'revolutionized the use of the astronomical literature', and was
   'probably the most valuable single contribution to astronomy research
   that the CfA has made in its lifetime'.

Sociological studies using ADS

   Because it is used almost universally by astronomers, ADS can reveal
   much about how astronomical research is distributed around the world.
   Most users of the system will reach from institutes of higher
   education, whose IP address can easily be used to determine the user's
   geographical location. Studies reveal that the highest per-capita users
   of ADS are France and Netherlands-based astronomers, and while more
   developed countries (measured by GDP per capita) use the system more
   than less developed countries; the relationship between GDP per capita
   and ADS use is not linear. The range of ADS uses per capita far exceeds
   the range of GDPs per capita, and basic research carried out in a
   country, as measured by ADS usage, has been found to be proportional to
   the square of the country's GDP divided by its population.

   ADS usage statistics also suggest that astronomers in more developed
   countries tend to be more productive than those in less developed
   countries. The amount of basic research carried out is proportional to
   the number of astronomers in a country multiplied by the GDP per
   capita. Statistics also imply that astronomers in European cultures
   carry out about three times as much research as those in Asian
   cultures, perhaps implying cultural differences in the importance
   attached to astronomical research.

   ADS has also been used to show that the fraction of single-author
   astronomy papers has decreased substantially since 1975 and that
   astronomical papers with more than 50 authors have become more common
   since 1990.
