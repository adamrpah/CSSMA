   Kites are raptors with long wings and weak legs which spend a great
   deal of time soaring. In general they feed on carrion but may also take
   live prey.

   They are birds of prey which along with hawks, eagles, Old World
   vultures and many others are in the family Accipitridae.

   Together with less closely related groups such as New World vultures
   and Osprey, they make up the diurnal bird of prey order Falconiformes.
