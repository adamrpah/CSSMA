   The M-10001 at Green River, Wyoming in 1937. The locomotive has been
   lengthened and given a 1,200 hp (890 kW) engine by this point; also, a
   more slanting pilot has been fitted and the paint scheme has been
   altered.

   The Union Pacific Railroad's M-10001 was a diesel-electric streamliner
   train built in late 1934 by Pullman-Standard with an engine from
   General Motors' Electro-Motive Division and General Electric generator
   and traction motors. It was the UP's second streamliner after the
   pioneering M-10000, the first equipped with a diesel engine and was a
   much larger train than its three-car predecessor. All cars were
   articulatedâ€” trucks were shared between each car. It was delivered on
   October 2, 1934 and was used for display, test and record-setting runs
   for the next two months before being returned to Pullman-Standard for
   an increase in its power and capacity, following which it was placed
   into service as the City of Portland train.

Record-setting run

   On October 22, 1934, the M-10001, still in its original 900 hp (670 kW)
   incarnation, set an as-yet unbroken record from coast to coast of the
   United States, running from Oakland Pier to Grand Central Terminal in
   57 hours. When placed into service as the City of Portland, the train
   reduced the Chicago, Illinois to Portland, Oregon schedule from 58
   hours to 40 hours without any upgrades to track or other facilities.

Technical details

   When built, the M-10001 was a fully articulated six-car train, 376 ft
   (115 m) in length, comprising a 48 ft (15 m) turret-cab power car, a
   Railway Post Office/baggage car, three Pullman sleeping cars, and a
   rounded-tail coach/buffet/observation car. It was powered by a 900 hp
   (670 kW) V12 version of the Winton 201-A engine, driving the first two
   trucks of the train.

   The rebuild lengthened the entire train to 455 feet (139 m) and seven
   cars. The power car had 12 ft (3.7 m) added to accommodate a larger,
   1,000 hp (750 kW) V16 Winton diesel engine. The RPO/baggage car was
   lengthened by eight feet (2.4 m) to take a steam generator for train
   heating, and was followed by the addition of a diner/lounge car.

   Both the 900 hp and 1,200 hp (670 and 890 kW) Winton diesels were the
   first of that type to be installed in a production train.

Service life

   The rebuilt train was re-delivered on May 23, 1935 and after some test
   runs was dedicated as the first City of Portland on June 5 at the
   Portland Rose Festival, entering service between Portland, Oregon and
   Chicago the following day. It remained in that service until June 1939,
   when it was replaced in service by the M-10002 trainset, reassigned
   from the City of Los Angeles. In December, the diesel engine,
   generator, trucks, and the steam generator from the RPO/baggage car
   were removed and installed in a new carbody to become the third power
   unit on the CD-07 set for the City of Denver, along with the former
   M-10003's two power cars. The remainder of the train was stored until
   August 13, 1941 when it was sold for scrap.
