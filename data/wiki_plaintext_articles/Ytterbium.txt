   Ytterbium ( IPA: /ɪˈtɛː(r)biəm/) is a chemical element in the periodic
   table that has the symbol Yb and atomic number 70. A soft silvery
   metallic element, ytterbium is a rare earth of the lanthanide series
   and is found in the minerals gadolinite, monazite, and xenotime. The
   element is sometimes associated with yttrium or other related elements
   and is used in certain steels. Natural ytterbium is a mix of seven
   stable isotopes.

Notable characteristics

   Ytterbium is a soft, malleable and rather ductile element that exhibits
   a bright silvery luster. A rare earth element, it is easily attacked
   and dissolved by mineral acids, slowly reacts with water, and oxidizes
   in air.

   Ytterbium has three allotropes which are called alpha, beta and gamma
   and whose transformation points are at −13 ° C and 795 °C. The beta
   form exists at room temperature and has a face-centered crystal
   structure while the high-temperature gamma form has a body-centered
   crystal structure.

   Normally, the beta form has a metallic-like electrical conductivity,
   but becomes a semiconductor when exposed to around 16,000 atm (1.6
   GPa). Its electrical resistance is tenfold larger at about 39,000 atm
   (3.9 GPa) but then dramatically drops to around 10% of its room
   temperature resistivity value at 40,000 atm (4 GPa).

Applications

   One ytterbium isotope has been used as a radiation source substitute
   for a portable X-ray machine when electricity was not available. Its
   metal could also be used to help improve the grain refinement,
   strength, and other mechanical properties of stainless steel. Some
   ytterbium alloys have been used in dentistry. There are few other uses
   of this element, e.g. in the form of ions in active laser media.

   The price for Ytterbium is $875(U.S. Dollars)for 1kg

History

   Ytterbium was discovered by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de
   Marignac in 1878. Marignac found a new component in the earth then
   known as erbia and named it ytterbia (after Ytterby, the Swedish town
   where he found the new erbia component). He suspected that ytterbia was
   a compound of a new element he called ytterbium.

   In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain separated Marignac's
   ytterbia into two components, neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia
   would later become known as the element ytterbium and lutecia would
   later be known as the element lutetium. Auer von Welsbach independently
   isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time but called
   them aldebaranium and cassiopeium.

   The chemical and physical properties of ytterbium could not be
   determined until 1953 when the first nearly pure ytterbium was
   produced.

Occurrence

   Ytterbium is found with other rare earth elements in several rare
   minerals. It is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand
   (~0.03% ytterbium). The element is also found in euxenite and xenotime.
   Ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths but
   ion-exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the late
   20th century have simplified separation. Known compounds of ytterbium
   are rare—they haven't been well characterized yet.

Isotopes

   Naturally occurring ytterbium is composed of 7 stable isotopes, Yb-168,
   Yb-170, Yb-171, Yb-172, Yb-173, Yb-174, and Yb-176, with Yb-174 being
   the most abundant (31.8% natural abundance). 22 radioisotopes have been
   characterized, with the most stable being Yb-169 with a half-life of
   32.026 days, Yb-175 with a half-life of 4.185 days, and Yb-166 with a
   half life of 56.7 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have
   half-lifes that are less than 2 hours, and the majority of these have
   half lifes that are less than 20 minutes. This element also has 6 meta
   states, with the most stable being Yb-169m (t[½] 46 seconds).

   The isotopes of ytterbium range in atomic weight from 150.955 u
   (Yb-151) to 179.952 u (Yb-180). The primary decay mode before the most
   abundant stable isotope, Yb-174 is electron capture, and the primary
   mode after is beta emission. The primary decay products before Yb-174
   are element 69 (thulium) isotopes, and the primary products after are
   element 71 (lutetium) isotopes. Of interest to modern quantum optics,
   the different ytterbium isotopes follow either Bose-Einstein statistics
   or Fermi-Dirac statistics, leading to interesting behaviour in optical
   lattices.

Precautions

   Although ytterbium is fairly stable, it nevertheless should be stored
   in closed containers to protect it from air and moisture. All compounds
   of ytterbium should be treated as highly toxic although initial studies
   appear to indicate that the danger is limited. Ytterbium compounds are,
   however, known to cause skin and eye irritation and may be teratogenic.
   Metallic ytterbium dust poses a fire and explosion hazard.
