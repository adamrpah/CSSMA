   The genus Saxicola, the stonechats or chats, is a genus of 14 species
   of small passerine birds restricted to the Old World. They are
   insectivores of open scrubland and grassland with scattered small
   shrubs.

   Genetic evidence presented in the recent monograph by Urquhart & Bowley
   2002 strongly supports the splitting of the Common Stonechat (Saxicola
   torquata sensu lato) into three species, African Stonechat (S.
   torquata), European Stonechat (S. rubicola) and Asian Stonechat (S.
   maura). This treatment is likely to become standard in the future.

   Species list, following Urquhart & Bowley 2002:
     * Whinchat, Saxicola rubetra
     * Stoliczka's Bushchat or White-browed Bushchat, Saxicola
       macrorhyncha
     * Hodgson's Bushchat or White-throated Bushchat, Saxicola insignis
     * Fuerteventura Chat or Canary Island Stonechat, Saxicola dacotiae
     * European Stonechat, Saxicola rubicola (previously S. torquata
       rubicola)
     * Siberian Stonechat or Asian Stonechat, Saxicola maura (previously
       S. torquata maura)
     * African Stonechat, Saxicola torquata
