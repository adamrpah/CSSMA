   The Thrushes, family Turdidae, are a group of passerine birds that
   occur mainly but not exclusively in the Old World.

   They are plump, soft plumaged, small to medium sized insectivores or
   sometimes omnivores, often feeding on the ground. Many have attractive
   songs.

   The taxonomic treatment of this large family has varied significantly
   in recent years. Traditionally it included the small Old World species,
   like the Nightingale and European Robin in the subfamily Saxicolini,
   ever so often either that group or the whole family is placed in the
   Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.

   This article follows Handbook of the Birds of the World with edits from
   Clement & Hathaway, Thrushes (2000), and retains the large thrushes in
   Turdidae.
