   Martina Navratilova (born October 18, 1956, in Prague, Czechoslovakia)
   is a former World No. 1 woman tennis player. Billie Jean King said
   about Navratilova in 2006, "She's the greatest singles, doubles and
   mixed doubles player who's ever lived." Tennis writer Steve Flink, in
   his book The Greatest Tennis Matches of the Twentieth Century, named
   her as the second best female player of the 20th century, directly
   behind Steffi Graf. As a serve and volley player, her best surface was
   grass, although she did capture at least two Grand Slam singles titles
   on each surface and won a career Grand Slam in singles, women's
   doubles, and mixed doubles.

   Originally from Czechoslovakia, she defected to the United States in
   1975 and became a U.S. citizen in 1981. During her career, she won 18
   Grand Slam singles titles and 41 Grand Slam doubles titles (31 women's
   doubles and 10 mixed doubles). She won the women's singles title at
   Wimbledon a record 9 times.

Tennis career

   Navratilova was born Martina Šubertová in 1956. Her parents divorced
   when she was three, and in 1962 her mother Jana married Miroslav
   Navrátil, who became her first tennis coach. Martina then took the name
   of her stepfather (adding the feminine suffix "ová"), thus becoming
   Martina Navrátilová ( IPA: [ˈmarcɪna ˈnavra:cɪlova:] ).

   In 1972 at the age of 15, Navratilova won the Czech republic national
   tennis championship. In 1973, aged 16, she turned professional. She won
   her first professional singles title in Orlando, Florida in 1974.

   A left-handed serve-and-volleyer with superb volleying skills,
   Navratilova raised the women’s game to new levels with her power and
   aggression. She struggled with her weight in the early years of her
   career and was at one point unflatteringly labelled the “Great Wide
   Hope” by journalist Bud Collins. Her determination, however, to reach
   the top of the game saw her embark on a punishing routine to get
   herself into shape, assisted by basketball's Nancy Lieberman.
   Eventually, extreme levels of fitness and conditioning were hallmarks
   of her game. She also was quick to adopt graphite racquet technology.

   Navratilova was a finalist at two Grand Slam singles tournaments in
   1975. She lost in the final of the Australian Open to Evonne Goolagong
   Cawley and in the final of the French Open to Chris Evert. After losing
   to Evert in the semifinals of that year's U.S. Open, the 18-year-old
   Navratilova went to the offices of the Immigration and Naturalization
   Service in New York City and informed them that she wished to defect
   from Communist Czechoslovakia. Within a month, she received a green
   card.

   Navratilova won her first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon in
   1978, where she defeated Evert in three sets in the final and captured
   the World No. 1 ranking for the first time. She beat Evert in the final
   again to successfully defend her Wimbledon title in 1979.

   In 1981, Navratilova won her third Grand Slam singles title by
   defeating Evert in the final of the Australian Open. Navratilova also
   reached the final of the U.S. Open, where she lost a third set tiebreak
   to Tracy Austin. Navratilova won both Wimbledon and the French Open in
   1982.

   Following adoption of Lieberman's exercise plan and using graphite
   racquets, Navratilova became the most dominant player in women's
   tennis. After losing in the fourth round of the first Grand Slam event
   of 1983 - the French Open - she captured the year's three remaining
   Grand Slam titles (the Australian Open was held in December at that
   time). Navratilova’s loss at the French Open was her only singles
   defeat during that year, during which she established an 86-1 record.
   Her winning percentage was the best ever for a professional tennis
   player. During 1982, 1983, and 1984, Navratilova lost a total of only
   six singles matches.

   Navratilova won the 1984 French Open, enabling her to hold all four
   Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously. Her accomplishment was
   declared a "Grand Slam" by Philippe Chatrier, who was the president of
   the International Tennis Federation. Many tennis observers, however,
   insisted that it was not a true Grand Slam because the titles had not
   been won in a single calendar year.

   Navratilova extended her Grand Slam singles tournament winning streak
   to a record-equalling six following wins at Wimbledon and the U.S.
   Open. She entered the 1984 Australian Open with a chance of winning all
   four titles in the same year. In the semifinals, however, Helena Suková
   ended Navratilova's 74-match winning streak (a record for a
   professional) 1-6, 6-3, 7-5.

   The left-handed Navratilova succeeded in winning all four Grand Slam
   women’s doubles titles in 1984, partnering right-handed Pam Shriver, a
   tall and talented player whose most noted stroke was a slice forehand,
   a virtually unheard of shot in the game today. This was part of a
   record 109-match winning streak that the pair achieved between 1983 and
   1985. (Navratilova was ranked the World No. 1 doubles player for a
   period of over three years in the 1980s.)

   In the three years from 1985 to 1987, Navratilova reached the women’s
   singles final at all 11 Grand Slam tournaments held during those years,
   winning six of them (and extending her run of triumphs at Wimbledon to
   a record six consecutive).

   A new threat to the 30-year old Navratilova's dominance, in the form of
   17-year old German player Steffi Graf, emerged on the scene in 1987
   when she beat Navratilova in the final of the French Open, whipping
   forehands and sliced backhand passing shots out of Navratilova’s reach.
   Navratilova beat Graf in the 1987 Wimbledon and U.S. Open finals (and
   at the U.S. Open became only the third player in the Open Era to win
   the women’s singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles at the same
   event). But Graf's consistent play throughout 1987 allowed her to
   obtain the World No. 1 before the end of the year. (Graf eventually
   broke Navratilova's records of 156 consecutive weeks and 331 total
   weeks as the World No. 1 singles player but never came close to
   breaking Navratilova's record 167 singles titles as Graf topped out at
   107.) In 1988, Graf won all four Grand Slam singles titles, beating
   Navratilova 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 in the Wimbledon final along the way. In
   1989, Graf and Navratilova met in the finals of both Wimbledon and the
   U.S. Open, with Graf winning both encounters in three sets. Despite the
   significant age difference between the two players, Navratilova won 9
   of the 18 career singles matches with Graf and 5 of the 9 Grand Slam
   singles matches with her.

   Navratilova's final Grand Slam singles triumph was in 1990. Graf lost
   in the Wimbledon semifinals that year to Zina Garrison. In the final,
   the 33-year old Navratilova swept Garrison 6-4, 6-1 to claim a
   record-breaking ninth Wimbledon singles crown. Though that was her last
   Grand Slam singles title, Navratilova made two further major finals in
   the years that followed. In 1991, she lost in the U.S. Open final to
   the new World No. 1 Monica Seles, after defeating Graf in a semifinal.
   And then in 1994, at the age of 37, Navratilova reached the Wimbledon
   final, where she lost in three sets to Conchita Martinez. Soon after,
   she retired from the singles tour. She was inducted into the
   International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2000.

   In 2000, Navratilova returned to the tour to play doubles events, while
   rarely also playing singles. In her first singles performance in eight
   years, at Eastbourne in 2002, she beat world number 22 Tatiana Panova
   and lost in the next round to Daniela Hantuchova in three sets. In
   2003, she won the mixed doubles titles at both the Australian Open and
   Wimbledon, partnering Leander Paes. This made her the oldest ever Grand
   Slam champion (aged 46 years, 8 months). The Australian Open victory
   made her only the third player in history to complete a “boxed set” of
   Grand Slam titles by winning the women’s singles, women’s doubles, and
   mixed doubles at all four slams. The Wimbledon win allowed her to equal
   Billie Jean King’s record of 20 Wimbledon titles (in singles women's
   doubles, and mixed doubles combined) and extended her overall number of
   Grand Slam titles to 58 (second only to Margaret Court, who won 62).
   Despite being criticized for receiving a wildcard, Navratilova
   decisively won a singles match in straight sets at the first round of
   Wimbledon in 2004, aged 47 years and 8 months, to make her the oldest
   player to win a professional singles match in the open era. She also
   won the first set of her second round match, but lost the match (to
   Gisela Dulko), and later noted that the angle of the sun, as the
   evening match progressed, made it very difficult to serve and volley.

   Over the course of her career, Navratilova won 167 top-level singles
   titles (more than any other player in the Open Era) and 177 doubles
   titles. Her most recent title in women's doubles (a Tier I event) came
   on August 21, 2006, at the Rogers Cup in Montreal, Canada, where she
   won the women's doubles event partnering Nadia Petrova. Navratilova won
   18 Grand Slam singles titles during her career: 9 at Wimbledon, 4 at
   the U.S. Open, 3 at the Australian Open, and 2 at the French Open. Her
   overall record in 67 Grand Slam events was 306-49 .862 (120-14 at
   Wimbledon, 89-17 at the U.S. Open, 51-11 at the French Open, and 46-7
   at the Australian Open).

   On July 5, 2006, Navratilova announced that Wimbledon 2006 would be her
   last and by the end of the 2006 season, she would retire from doubles
   play. On July 6, 2006, Navratilova played her last ever match at
   Wimbledon, losing in the mixed doubles to the titleists, Israel's Andy
   Ram and Russia's Vera Zvonareva, in the third round. Earlier on the
   same day, Navratilova lost her women's doubles quarterfinal match
   against Chinese fourth seeds Zi Yan and Jie Zheng, also the titleists.
   Navratilova capped off her career by winning the mixed doubles title at
   the 2006 U.S. Open with Bob Bryan, her 41st Grand Slam doubles title
   (31 in women's doubles and 10 in mixed doubles) and 177th overall. The
   only Grand Slam mixed doubles title that eluded her since her return
   was the French Open.

Personal life

   In the 1980s, Navratilova came out as bisexual. She later clarified
   that she was a lesbian. In an interview with Gaysports.com, she said,
   "It was a little difficult because I had previously been with a guy.
   But once I had a lesbian experience I realized that although I liked
   guys and still do like guys emotionally I could only be attached to
   women."

   In her autobiography, Being Myself, Navratilova says that she had
   romantic crushes on teachers of both sexes and, later, felt strongly
   attracted to other female tennis players. But she did not realize that
   these attractions had a sexual dimension until she was 18 years old,
   when she had her first gay relationship.

   However, her parents — especially her father — were disturbed by the
   news of her sexual orientation, which her father characterized as a
   "sickness." During one of the many arguments that followed
   Navratilova's coming out, her father said that he would have preferred
   for her to have been a prostitute. Navratilova said she feared her
   sexual orientation might disrupt her application for American
   citizenship following her defection from Czechoslovakia, a country in
   which, she points out, "gays were sent to insane asylums and lesbians
   never came out of the closet."

   In 1981, shortly after being granted U.S. citizenship, Navratilova came
   out publicly about her sexual orientation. From 1983 to 1991,
   Navratilova had a long-term relationship with partner Judy Nelson.
   Their split in 1991 included a much-publicized legal wrangle.
   Navratilova was featured in a WITA (Women's International Tennis
   Association) calendar, shot by Jean Renard with her Wimbledon trophies
   and Nelson's children in the background.

   Navratilova also made a humorous guest appearance on the gay-themed NBC
   sitcom Will & Grace in a 2000 episode in which a flashback revealed
   that she had been a heterosexual until a 1985 relationship with Karen
   Walker turned her gay .

   Navratilova released an autobiography, simply entitled "Martina", in
   1985 and also co-wrote three mystery novels in the 1990s.

Activism and politics

   Navratilova and Mark Tewksbury read the Declaration of Montreal at the
   opening ceremonies of the World Outgames.

   opening ceremonies of the World Outgames.

   When not playing tennis, Navratilova is involved with various charities
   that benefit animal rights, underprivileged children, and gay rights.
   She filed a lawsuit against Amendment 2, a 1992 ballot proposition in
   Colorado designed to deny legal benefits to gays and lesbians. In the
   same year, she spoke before the National March on Washington for Gay
   and Lesbian Rights.

   In 2000, she was the recipient of National Equality Award from the
   Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian
   activist/lobbying group.

   A vegetarian, Navratilova has appeared in ad campaigns for People for
   the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In an April 2006 interview, she said
   she had recently begun eating fish again because she found it hard to
   get enough protein while on the road.

   She has also spoken out on a number of volatile political issues,
   including tort/litigation reform, but perhaps her most consistent theme
   - aside from gay and lesbian rights - has been her unstinting
   opposition to Communism, and unrepentant opposition to the former
   Eastern Bloc power structure that she believes compelled her to flee
   her native Czechoslovakia.

   For example, on a recent segment of the Leonard Lopate Show-in which
   she was promoting her new fitness training book-she denounced the
   Soviet Union's control over Czechoslovakia, maintaining that she
   refuses to speak Russian to this day because of the Soviet Union's
   former hegemony over Eastern Europe. When questioned by the host about
   her fellow Czechs' reaction to her defection she averred that they
   welcomed it, and that their hostility was directed towards the
   Communist regime in power, not her.

   "Whenever I hear some say, 'Oh, Communism isn't bad,' I say, 'Why don't
   you live in in a Communist country if you think it's so great?'" .

   Navratilova was a guest on CNN's Connie Chung Tonight show on July 17,
   2002. During the show, Chung quoted a German newspaper which quoted
   Navratilova as saying:

          "The most absurd part of my escape from the unjust system is
          that I have exchanged one system that suppresses free opinion
          for another. The Republicans in the U.S. manipulate public
          opinion and sweep controversial issues under the table. It's
          depressing. Decisions in America are based solely on the
          question of how much money will come out of it and not on the
          questions of how much health, morals or environment suffer as a
          result."

   Navratilova said that the remarks were in reference to what she
   perceived as a trend of centralization of government power and a loss
   of personal freedom. In the discussion that followed, Chung questioned,
   "Can I be honest with you? I can tell you that when I read this, I have
   to tell you that I thought it was un-American, unpatriotic. I wanted to
   say, go back to Czechoslovakia. You know, if you don't like it here,
   this a country that gave you so much, gave you the freedom to do what
   you want."

   Navratilova responded, "And I'm giving it back. This is why I speak
   out. When I see something that I don't like, I'm going to speak out
   because you can do that here. And again, I feel there are too many
   things happening that are taking our rights away." She went on to say
   that athletes have a responsibility to speak out when things aren't
   right.

Trivia

     * The character Martina Zoana Mel Navratilova from the anime series
       Slayers was named after her.
     * When Navratilova celebrated her 50th birthday on October 12, 2006,
       she received a birthday cake made at Charm City Cakes by a crew led
