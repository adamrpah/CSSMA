   Peter Grimes is an opera by Benjamin Britten, with a libretto adapted
   by Montagu Slater from the Peter Grimes section of George Crabbe's poem
   The Borough.

   It was first performed at Sadler's Wells in London on June 7, 1945,
   conducted by Reginald Goodall. It was the first of Britten's operas to
   be a critical and popular success. It is still widely performed, both
   in the UK and internationally and is considered part of the standard
   repertoire. In addition, the "Four Sea Interludes" were published
   separately and are frequently performed as an orchestral suite.

History

   Britten and his partner Peter Pears read the poem by Crabbe and were
   struck by it. They both had a strong hand in drafting the story, and in
   this process the character of Grimes became far more complex. Rather
   than being the clear-cut villain he is in Crabbe's version, he became a
   victim of both cruel fate and society, while retaining darker aspects
   in his character. It is left to the audience to decide which version is
   more true, and to see how clear-cut or ambiguous the various characters
   are.

   Pears was certainly the intended Peter Grimes, and it is likely that
   Britten wrote the role of Ellen Orford for Joan Cross. The work has
   been called "a powerful allegory of homosexual oppression," but the
   composer's own summation of the work was simpler: "a subject very close
   to my heartâ€”the struggle of the individual against the masses. The more
   vicious the society, the more vicious the individual" (from a 1948
   interview to Time magazine).

   Though in the original version of the libretto Grimes' relations with
   the boys were clearly pederastic, Pears persuaded Slater to cut out
   most of the pederasty from the final version. The opera was
   commissioned by the Koussevitzky Music Foundation and is "dedicated to
   the memory of Natalie Koussevitzky", wife of the Russian-born American
   conductor Serge Koussevitzky.

Setting

   The "Borough," a fictional village, which shares some similarities with
   Crabbe's, and later Britten's, own home Aldeburgh, on England's east
   coast, around 1830.

Synopsis

Prologue

   Peter Grimes is questioned at an inquest over the death of his
   apprentice. The townsfolk, all present, make it clear they think Grimes
   guilty and deserving of punishment. Although the coroner, Mr. Swallow,
   determines the boy's death to be accidental and clears Grimes without a
   proper trial, he advises Grimes not to get another apprentice. As the
   court is cleared, Ellen Orford, the schoolmistress, attempts to comfort
   Grimes as he rages against what he sees as the Borough community's
   unwillingness to give him a true second chance.

Act I

   The chorus, who constitute "the Borough," sing of their weary daily
   round and their relationship with the sea and the seasons. Grimes
   claims to be in desperate need of help to fish, and his friend, the
   apothecary Ned Keene, finds him a new apprentice from the workhouse.
   Nobody will volunteer to fetch the boy, until Ellen (whom Grimes wishes
   to marry) offers.

   When Ellen brings the apprentice to Grimes at the pub that evening, he
   immediately sets off to his hut, despite the fact that the Borough is
   weathering an ominous storm.

Act II

   On Sunday morning while most of the Borough is at church, Ellen talks
   with John, the apprentice. She is horrified when she finds a bruise on
   his neck. When she confronts Grimes about it, he brusquely claims that
   it was an accident. Growing agitated at her mounting concern and
   interference, he strikes her and runs off with the boy. This did not go
   unseen: first Keene, Auntie, and Bob Boles, then the chorus generally
   evolve into a mob to investigate Grimes's hut. As the men march off,
   Ellen, Auntie, and the nieces sing sadly of the relationship of women
   with men.

   At the hut, Grimes accuses the, as always, silent John of "telling
   stories" then becomes lost in his memories of the dead apprentice,
   reliving the boy's death of thirst. When he hears the mob of villagers
   approaching he quickly comes back to reality and gets ready to set out
   to sea: he tells John to be careful climbing down to his boat, but to
   no avail: the boy falls to his death. When the mob reaches the hut
   Grimes is gone, and they find nothing out of order, so disperse.

Act III

   Nighttime in the Borough. While a dance is going on, Mrs. Sedley tries
   to convince the authorities that Grimes is a murderer, but to no avail.
   Ellen and Captain Balstrode confide in each other: Grimes has returned
   after many days at sea, and Balstrode has discovered a jersey washed
   ashore: a jersey that Ellen recognizes as one she had knitted for John.
   Mrs. Sedley overhears this, and with the knowledge that Grimes has
   returned, she is able to instigate another mob. Singing "Him who
   despises us we'll destroy," the villagers go off in search of Grimes.

   While the chorus can be heard searching for him, Grimes appears
   onstage, singing a long monologue: John's death has seemingly pushed
   Grimes, already dangerously unstable, over the edge. Ellen and
   Balstrode find him, and the old captain encourages Grimes to take his
   boat out to sea and sink it. Grimes leaves. The next morning, the
   Borough begins its day anew. There is a report from the coast guard of
   a ship sinking off the coast. This is dismissed by Auntie as "one of
   these rumours."
