   The History of the Royal Australian Navy can be traced back to 1788 and
   the colonisation of Australia by the British. During this period until
   1859 vessels of the Royal Navy made frequent trips to the new colonies.
   In 1859 the Australia Squadron was formed as a separate squadron and
   remained in Australia until 1913. During the period before Federation
   each of the 6 Australian colonies operated their own colonial naval
   force, these amalgamated in 1901 as the Commonwealth Naval Force. The
   Royal Australian Navy (RAN) was established in 1911 and in 1913 the
   fleet steamed through Sydney Heads for the first time.

   The Royal Australian Navy has seen action in every ocean of the world
   during its short life. The navy first saw action in World War I and
   distinguished itself in three oceans. Between the wars the RAN's
   fortunes shifted with the financial situation of Australia,
   experiencing great growth during the 1920s but was forced to shrink in
   the 1930s. Entering World War II the navy was not in the situation it
   was in 1914. During the war the size of the RAN grew to over 300
   vessels of all classes. After World War II the RAN saw action in Korea,
   Vietnam and other smaller conflicts. Today the RAN fields a small but
   modern force, widely regarded as one of the most powerful forces in the
   Asia Pacific Region.

Pre-federation Navies

   From the colonisation of Australia in 1788 until 1859 the blue water
   defence of Australia was provided by detached units of the Royal Navy's
   East Asia Squadron based in Sydney. In 1859 Australia was established
   as a separate Royal Navy squadron, this marked the first occasion the
   Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The
   Australia Squadron remained the primary naval force in Australian
   waters until 1913 when command was transferred to the Royal Australian
   Navy.

   Prior to Federation each self-governing colony in Australia operated
   its own colonial naval force, though Western Australia never operated
   any vessels. The colonial navies usually consisted of gunboats for
   coastal defence of harbours and rivers and naval brigades to man
   vessels and forts. In 1861, the Victorian colonial ship HMVS Victoria
   was deployed to assist the New Zealand colonial government during a
   Maori rebellion. When the Victoria returned to Australia the vessel had
   suffered one fatality and taken part in several minor actions. The
   deployment of Victoria to New Zealand marked the first occasion that an
   Australian warship had been deployed overseas. For the majority of the
   colonial period New South Wales had maintained the most capable naval
   force, but in the years leading up to Federation Victoria became
   regarded as the most powerful of all the colonial navies. After
   Federation all colonial vessels became part of the Commonwealth Naval
   Force.

   After the Federation of Australia in 1901, the Commonwealth Naval
   Forces was formed by amalgamating the six separate colonial navies. The
   Commonwealth government, however, paid for the Royal Navy to continue
   providing blue water defence.

   A growing number of people, among them Captain William Rooke Creswell,
   the director of the Commonwealth Naval Forces, demanded an autonomous
   Australian navy, financed and controlled by Australia. In 1909 Prime
   Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial
   Conference in London, sought the British Government's agreement to end
   the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty
   rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that
   a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin
   was not impressed with the Admiralty and in 1908 invited the Great
   White Fleet to visit Australia, this fired the public enthusiasm for a
   modern navy and lead to the order of two 700 ton River class
   destroyers, a purchase that angered the British. The surge in German
   naval construction in 1909 lead the Admiralty to change their position
   on an Australian Navy. For his work Creswell's name lives on as the
   name of the naval base, HMAS Creswell, the site of the Royal Australian
   Naval College at Jervis Bay.

   The first Australian warship, the destroyer HMAS Parramatta, was
   launched at Govan in Scotland on Wednesday 9 February 1910 and its
   sister ship HMAS Yarra, was launched at Dumbarton in Scotland on
   Saturday 9 April 1910. Both ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy
   on Monday 19 September 1910 and sailed for Australia. They arrived at
   Port Phillip on Saturday December 10, 1910 an event that was marred by
   the death of Engineer Lieutenant W. Robertson, RN. Robertson suffered a
   heart attack 8 miles outside Port Phillip Heads whilst onboard HMAS
   Yarra and drowned.

   In October 1911 King George V fixed his signature to the approval for
   the Royal Australian Navy and the ships now officially received the
   prefix "His Majesty's Australian Ship" (HMAS). The manpower of the
   fleet stood at four hundred officers and men and, for the next two
   years, ships were built for the fledgling navy. On Saturday 4 October
   1913 the first Fleet Review of the Royal Australian Navy took place,
   the battle cruiser HMAS Australia, the cruisers HMAS Melbourne and HMAS
   Sydney, the protected cruiser HMAS Encounter and the torpedo-boat
   destroyers Parramatta, Yarra and Warrego, entered Sydney Harbour.

   In 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, bringing the whole
   British Empire, including Australia, into war. The war was greeted with
   enthusiasm in Australia, and over 200,000 troops were deployed to the
   Middle East for campaigns in Gallipoli, Turkey.

   At the outbreak of war the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) consisted of
   Australia, the light cruisers Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane (Under
   Construction), the Destroyers Parramatta, Yarra and Warrego and the
   submarines AE1 and AE2. With 3 more destroyers under construction. The
   RAN also maintained a small fleet of auxiliary ships. The Royal
   Australian Navy at the start of the war was a formidable force.

   During the Imperial Conference of 1911 it was decided that in the event
   of war the ships of the Royal Australia Navy would be transferred to
   Admiralty control and under the Naval Defence Act of 1912 this power to
   make the transfer was conferred in the Governor General. The RAN would
   become the Australia Squadron of the Royal Navy with all ships and men
   under the direct control of the Admiralty, while the RAN remained
   responsible for the upkeep of the ships and training of men. On 3
   August 1914 the Australian Government sent the following message to the
   Admiralty.

   On the 8th August the British Government telegrammed the Australian
   Government saying that the Admiralty would be grateful if the transfer
   be made immediately if not already done. On the 10th the Governor
   General officially transferred control of the RAN to the Admiralty. The
   Admiralty returned control of the RAN to the Australian Government on
   31 August 1921

   Australian Navy ships first saw action Asian and Pacific theatre
   assisting in the attack on German New Guinea by the Australian Naval
   and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF). In 1884 Germany colonised
   the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups.
   The Germans used the colony as a wireless radio base, Britain required
   the wireless installations to be destroyed because they were used by
   the German East Asia Squadron which threatened merchant shipping in the
   region. The objectives of the force were the German stations at Yap in
   the Caroline Islands, Nauru and at Rabaul, New Britain. On 30 August
   1914 the AN&MEF left Sydney under the protection of the HMAS Australia
   and HMAS Melbourne for Port Moresby where it met the Queensland
   contingent aboard the transport HMAHS Kanowna. The force then sailed
   for German New Guinea on September 7 but the Kanowna was left behind
   when her stokers refused to work. HMAS Sydney and some destroyers met
   the AN&MEF off the eastern tip of New Guinea. Melbourne was detached to
   destroy the wireless station on Nauru, while on September 14, Encounter
   bombarded a ridge near the town, while half a battalion advanced
   towards the town. The only major loss of the campaign was the
   disappearance of the Australian submarine AE1 during a patrol off
   Rabaul on 14 September 1914.

   On 9 November 1914 the German light cruiser SMS Emden attacked the
   critical radio and telegraph station at Direction Island in the Cocos
   (Keeling) Islands. The inhabitants of the island managed to transmit a
   distress signal and Sydney, only 50 miles away, began to steam towards
   the island. The Sydney reached the area in around two hours and was
   engaged by Emden. Sydney which was the larger, faster and better armed
   of the two and eventually overpowered the Emden, with the captain Karl
   von Müller running the ship aground on North Keeling Island to avoid
   sinking, at 11.15am. At first Emden refused to strike its colours,
   Sydney fired on the stationary Emden until it evetually struck its
   colours. The Battle of Cocos was the first ship-against-ship engagement
   for the Royal Australian Navy.

   During the Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign the Australian
   submarine AE2 became the first Allied warship to breach the Turkish
   defences of the Dardanelles. AE2 spent five days in the area and came
   under attack several time but was unable to find any large enemy troop
   transports. On 29 April 1915 she was damaged in an attack by the
   Turkish torpedo-boat Sultan Hisar in Artaki Bay and was scuttled by her
   crew. The wreck of AE2 remained undiscovered until 2 July 1998, 83
   years after she was scuttled.

   Ships of the Royal Australian Navy also assisted the Royal Navy in the
   blockade of the German High Seas Fleet. HMAS Australia was the flagship
   of the 2nd Battle Cruiser Squadron and was to take part in the Battle
   of Jutland. Australia was forced to miss the battle after she collided
   with her sister ship HMS New Zealand on 22 April 1916, Australia did
   not return to service until 9 June 1916. Three vessels of the Royal
   Australian Navy were present during the surrender of the German High
   Seas Fleet; HMAS Australia, Sydney and Melbourne, Australia lead the
   2nd Battle Cruiser Squadron during the surrender. The RAN's only two
   losses during the war were the submarines AE1 and AE2.

The RAN and the 1918-19 Influenza Pandemic

   Between April 1918 and May 1919 the Spanish Flu killed an estimated 25
   million people worldwide, far more than had been killed in four years
   of war. A rigorous quarantine policy was implemented in Australia this
   reduced the immediate impact of the flu, but by the end of 1919 the
   nations death toll stood at more than 11,500.

   When the pandemic struck in 1918 the ships of the Royal Australian Navy
   were dispersed throughout the world, the speed at which the flu spread
   coupled with the cramped mess decks and poorly ventilated living spaces
   on early 20th Century warships created a favorable environment for the
   disease. The pandemic swept through the British Grand Fleet in 1918 and
   the Australian cruisers suffered high casualties, with up to 157
   casualties in one ship alone. Outbreaks in the Mediterranean fleets
   were more severe than those in the Atlantic. HMAS Brisbane recorded 183
   casualties between November and December 1918, of those casualties 2
   men died of pneumonia. The RAN lost a total of 26 men to the disease.
   The saving factor was largely the ready availability of professional
   medical treatment.

   The disease arrived in the South Pacific on the cargo vessel SS Talune
   which sailed from Auckland on 30 October 1918, knowingly carrying sick
   passengers. The Talune stopped in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Nauru, the
   first outbreaks occurred within days of the ships visits. The local
   authorities were generally unprepared for the size of the outbreak and
   the infection spread uncontrollably. The German territory of Samoa was
   the worst affected of the small islands, the New Zealand administration
   carried out no efforts to lessen the outbreak and rejected offers of
   assistance from nearby American Samoa. The New Zealand government
   officially apologised to Samoa in 2002 for their reaction to the
   outbreak. On 29 November 1918 the military governor of Apia requested
   assistance from Wellington; the request was turned down on the grounds
   that all doctors were needed in New Zealand. Australia offered the only
   alternate source of aid.

   The Commonwealth Naval Board were aware of the worsening situation in
   the region, the sloop HMAS Fantome while stationed in Fiji reported its
   first case on 11 November 1918, and soon half her complement was
   affected. On 20 November 1918 the naval board began forming a joint
   relief expedition from available military medical personnel. The
   commanding officer of HMAS Encounter was then ordered to embark the
   expedition in Sydney and sail as soon as possible. Encounter departed
   Sydney on 24 November 1918 ten minutes after completing loading. As a
   precaution all 450 members of the Encounters crew were doubly
   inoculated, the ship had suffered 74 cases earlier in the year at
   Fremantle and the captain did not want a repeat. Encounter arrived in
   Suva on 30 November and took half the available coal and 39 tonnes of
   water. Spanish flu was rampant in Suva and Captain Thring implemented a
   strict quarantine and placed guards on the wharf and all coaling was
   carried out by the crew, coaling was usually carried out by native
   labor. Encounter departed Suva in the evening of the same day and
   arrived off Apia on 3 December. Within six hours the medical landing
   party and their stores were ashore, Encounter departed for the Tongan
   capital of Nuku'alofa immediately arriving their on 5 December. The
   last of the medical staff and supplies were unloaded, Encounter short
   on coal sailed for Suva on 7 December. On arriving in Suva Encounter
   received orders to return to Sydney. She reached Sydney on 17 December
   and was immediately placed in quarantine. The South Pacific aid mission
   is regarded as Australia's first overseas relief expedition and set a
   precedent for future relief mission conducted by the RAN.

Between the wars

   Following the end of World War I the Australian Government believed
   that an immediate evaluation of the RAN was necessary. Australia had
   based its naval policy on the Henderson Recommendations of 1911
   developed by Sir Reginald Henderson. The government sent an invitation
   to Admiral John Jellicoe, he arrived in Australia in May 1919. Jellicoe
   remained in Australia for 3 months and then returned to England via New
   Zealand and Canada. Jellicoe submitted his findings in August 1919,
   titled the Report on the Naval Mission to the Commonwealth. The report
   outlined several policies designed to strengthen British naval strength
   in the Pacific. The report heavily stressed a close relationship
   between the RAN and the Royal Navy. This would be achieved by strict
   adherence to the procedure and method of Administration of the Royal
   Navy. The report also suggested constant officer exchange between the
   two forces. Jellicoe also called for the creation of a large Far East
   Imperial Fleet which would include capital ships and aircraft carriers,
   this force would be mainly based in Singapore. The cost for the
   creation of such a fleet would be divided between Great Britain,
   Australia and New Zealand each contributing 75, 20 and 5% respectively.
   The suggested make up of the RAN would include; 1 aircraft carrier, 2
   battlecruisers, 8 light cruisers, 1 flotilla leader, 12 destroyers, a
   destroyer depot ship, 8 submarines, 1 submarine parent ship and a small
   number of additional auxiliary ships. The annual cost and depreciation
   of the fleet was estimated to be £4,024,600. None of Jellicoe's major
   recommendations were carried out except for the establishment of closer
   ties with Britain. Although some of the minor recommendations were
   implemented.

   With the end of World War I the Australian Government began to worry
   about the threat Japan posed to Australia. Japan had extended its
   empire 3000km to the south bringing it right to Australia's doorstep.
   Japan had continued to build up its naval force and had reached a stage
   where it outgunned to Royal Navy in the Pacific. The RAN and the
   government believed that the possibility of a Japanese invasion was
   highly likely. Admiral Jellicoe in his report believed that the threat
   of a Japanese invasion of Australia would remain as long as the White
   Australia Policy remained in place. Due to the perceived threat and
   bilateral support in Australia for the White Australia Policy the
   Australian Government became a vocal supporter of the continuance of
   the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Australia was joined in its support
   for the alliance by New Zealand but was heavily opposed by Canada,
   Canada believed the alliance hindered the Empires relationship with
   China and the United States. No decision on the alliance as agreed on.
   The discussion was shelved pending the outcome of the Washington Naval
   Treaty. The results of the treaty which allowed the British to retain
   naval supremacy in the Pacific created a sense of security in
   Australia. Many Australian saw the Four Powers Pact as replacing the
   Anglo-Japanese Alliance. This sense of security became known as the Ten
   Year Rule. This lead to defence retrenchments in Australia following
   the international trend and a £500,000 reduction in expenditure. The
   Governor General Henry Forster when opening parliament on 22 June 1922
   was quoted as saying.


   History of the Royal Australian Navy

    In view of the result of attained at the Washington Treaty which, my
   advisors believe, guarantee peace in the Pacific for some time to come,
    it is proposed to reduce the establishment of the navy and army, and
                  postpone the expansion of the air force.

   Between World War I and World War II the Royal Australian Navy suffered
   a severe reduction in men and ships. As a result of the Washington
   Naval Treaty the flagship HMAS Australia was scraped with her main
   armaments and sunk outside Sydney Heads in 1924. In the same year the
   RAN began a five year program of obtaining new ships from Britain - the
   heavy cruisers HMAS Australia and HMAS Canberra and the seaplane
   carrier HMAS Albatross. This purchase was partly paid for by scrapping
   HMAS Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney along with most of the destroyers.
   The Great Depression of 1929 hit the RAN hard and lead to another
   reduction of manpower, the RAN although reduced in size had no problem
   filling its ranks, many men were unemployed and the pay was quite high
   for the period. Strength of the RAN fell to 3117 personnel plus 131
   members of the Naval Auxiliary Services. In 1932 the strength of the
   Reserves stood at 5446. In the early 1930s, lack of funds forced the
   transfer of the Royal Australian Naval College from Jervis Bay to
   Flinders Naval Depot in Victoria. In 1933 the Australian Government
   ordered 3 light cruisers the HMAS Perth, Hobart and Sydney and sold the
   seaplane carrier to fund the Hobart. During this time the RAN also
   purchased destroyers of the V and W class the ships that would come to
   be know as the Scrap Iron Flotilla. With the ever increasing threat of
   Germany and Japan in the late 1930s the RAN was not in the position it
   was at the outbreak of World War I.

World War II

   Australia declared war on Nazi Germany one hour after the United
   Kingdom's declaration of war on 3 September 1939. At the onset of war,
   the Royal Australian Navy numbered two heavy cruisers, HMAS Australian
   and Canberra both carried 8-inch guns and had entered service in the
   1920s - three modern light cruisers HMAS Hobart, Perth and Sydney,
   which mounted 6-inch guns. The older cruiser HMAS Adelaide also
   remained in service. The RAN also possessed 4 sloops, HMAS Parramatta,
   Swan, Warrego and Yarra, though only the Swan and Yarra were
   commissioned. The RAN's destroyer force consisted of five obsolete V
   class destroyers. The RAN also featured a variety of support and
   ancillary craft. Men and vessels of the RAN served in every theatre of
   operations, from the tropical Pacific to the frigid Russian convoys. By
   the end of the war the RAN's combat strength numbered 150 ships with an
   additional 200 auxiliary craft. The RAN reached its peak in June 1945
   when it ranks swelled to 39,650. During the war the RAN lost 19 ships
   and 2,176 men and women died while serving in the RAN, 1,740 of them on
   ships of the RAN.

War in the Mediterranean

   From Mid- 1940 sips of the RAN, at the request of the Admiralty began
   to deploy to the Mediterranean Sea to take part in the Battle of the
   Mediterranean against Fascist Italy. HMAS Sydney deployed in May 1940
   and was soon joined by Hobart. The RAN then offered the services of
   Australia to the Admiralty, the offer was gratefully accepted. When
   Australia arrived in the Mediterranean the RAN has sent nearly the
   entire combat fleet to the Northern Hemisphere, leaving Australian open
   to possible attack.

   On 27 June 1940 Admiral Cunningham commander of the Mediterranean Fleet
   ordered the 7th Cruiser Squadron, which included HMAS Sydney to
   rendezvous with an Egypt bound convoy near Cape Matapan. The cruiser
   squadron sighted three Italian cruisers at 6 pm on 28 June 1940 and
   immediately engaged them. Within an hour the Italian cruiser Espero was
   incapacitated and Sydney was signaled to sink her. As Sydney approached
   the Espero launched torpedoes, but failed to hit any targets. Sydney
   fired four salvos, scoring 10 direct hits on the Espero. Sydney
   remained at the scene for two hours picking up survivors.

   On 7 July 1940 a 25 ship fleet departed Alexandria intending to meet a
   convoy east of Malta. The next day a submarine reported sighting a
   Italian fleet 500 miles away, the fleet altered course to intercept.
   The two fleet sighted each other at 3 pm on 9 July 1940 and a battle
   that became known as the Battle of Calabria began. Four vessels of the
   RAN took part in the battle the; HMAS Sydney, Stuart, Vampire and the
   Voyager. Sydney was the first RAN vessels to engage the enemy and at
   3.23 pm opened fire. The Italian fleet began to withdrawal, the Allied
   destroyer squadron was ordered forward. HMAS Stuart leading the
   destroyer force was the first to open fire; her opening salvo was fired
   at a range of 12,600 yards and was recorded as a direct hit. The
   Italian fleet retired under smoke and the Allied fleet retired. The
   fleet remained under constant air attack and Sydney which came under
   heavy attack was believed to have sunk. The fleet arrived back in
   Alexandria on 13 July.

   On 17 July 1940 HMAS Sydney was ordered to support a Royal Navy
   destroyer squadron on a sweep north of the island of Crete. At 7.20 am
   on 19 July the Italian cruiser were sighted off Cape Spada by the
   destroyers, Sydney 40 miles away began to steam towards the enemy
   destroyers at over 30 knots. Sydney sighted the cruisers at 8.29 am by
   that time Sydney had achieved a speed of 37 knots, she opened fire at a
   range of 17,360 metres. The Italian cruisers began to retire from the
   area under a smokescreen with Sydney and the destroyers in pursuit.
   Sydney scored her first direct hit on the Giovanni dalle Bande Nere at
   8.35 am and at the same time began to score repeated hits on the
   Bartolomeo Colleoni which by 9.25 am was incapacitated. Captain John
   Collins ordered the destroyers to sink the Colleoni, Collins who had
   maintained radio silence for two hours sent the following message.

                One cruiser sunk. Ammunition practically gone


   History of the Royal Australian Navy

   By 10.27 am Collins decided to end the chase, largely due to the fact
   that the Sydney was almost out of ammunition. Sydney though hit several
   times during the battle she suffered no casualties, but casualties were
   suffered in subsequent air attacks.

   On 6 September 1940 HMAS Australia was ordered to sail to Freetown,
   Sierra Leone to join an invasion force. On 19 September Australia and
   the RN cruiser HMS Cumberland sighted three Vichy French cruisers
   heading south and shadowed them. When one of them the Gloire developed
   engine trouble, Australia escorted her towards Casablanca and returned
   to the fleet two days later. On 23 September Australia came under heavy
   fire from shore batteries and then drove two Vichy destroyers back into
   port. Australia then engaged and sunk the destroyer L'Audacieux with
   eight salvos in sixteen minutes. Over the next two days French and
   Allied forces exchanged fire; the Australia was struck twice and lost
   her Walrus amphibian. Australia and the rest of the fleet retired on 25
   September the battle became known as the Battle of Dakar.

   On 27 March 1941 an Allied fleet under Admiral Cunningham was ambushed
   by an Italian naval force off Cape Matapan, Greece. Three vessels of
   the RAN took part in the battle; HMAS Perth, Stuart and Vampire. The
   victory at Cape Matapan allowed the evacuation of thousands of Allied
   troops from Crete.

Scrap Iron Flotilla

   The Scrap Iron Flotilla was an Australian destroyer group that operated
   in the Mediterranean and Pacific during World War II. The name Scrap
   Iron Flotilla was bestowed upon the group by Nazi Propaganda Minister
   Joseph Goebbels who described the fleet as a "consignment of junk" and
   "Australia’s Scrap-Iron Flotilla". The flotilla consisted of five
   vessels the Scott class destroyer HMAS Stuart which acted as flotilla
   leader and four V class destroyers; Vampire, Vendetta, Voyager and
   Waterhen. The ships were all built to fight in World War I and were
   slow and poorly armed compared to newer ships. The five destroyers
   which made up Australia's total destroyer force departed Australian in
   November 1939 destined for Singapore. In Singapore the destroyers
   carried out anti-submarine exercises with the Royal Navy, the RAN had
   not seen submarines since the departure of HMAS Oxley and HMAS Otway in
   1931. On 13 November 1939 the flotilla sailed left Singapore for the
   Mediterranean following a request from the Admiralty for assistance.
   The flotilla took part in multiple actions while in the Mediterranean
   including the evacuation of Greece in April 1941, though the flotilla
   came to fame in the mission to re supply the besieged city of Tobruk.
   The resupply routes from Alexandria and Mersa Matruh to Tobruk became
   known as "Bomb Alley" and was subject to constant Axis air attacks. The
   flotilla which by this time was in poor condition but managed to make
   138 runs to Tobruk carrying in ammunition and stores and taking out
   wounded soldiers. Vampire left the Mediterranean on 28 May 1941 but the
   remaining four destroyers remained until July 1941. Of the five
   destroyers in the flotilla three were lost during the war; Waterhen was
   sunk in the Mediterranean on 30 June 1941, while Vampire was sunk by
   Japanese aircraft and Voyager ran aground in Betano Bay.

Red Sea

   As well as serving in the Mediterranean Sea ships of the RAN also
   served in the Red Sea. In August 1940 Italian forces advanced into
   British Somaliland, after a fighting withdrawal the small British
   garrison was evacuated from Berbera with HMAS Hobart assisting in the
   destruction of the port and its facilities. To aid in the delaying
   action the Hobart sent a 3-pounder gun ashore, manned by volunteers
   from the crew. The volunteers were captures by the Italians, and then
   liberated only months later. Two RAN sloops joined the Red Sea force in
   1940, the Parramatta on 30 July and the Yarra in September. In October
   Yarra engaged two Italian destroyers attempting to raid a convoy; Yarra
   drove the destroyers off saving the convoy. Though vessels of the RAN
   served in the Red Sea throughout the war, after 1941 larger vessels
   were deployed to Australian waters in response to the threat of Japan

   After the Japanese attacks on the Allies in December 1941, the RAN
   redeployed its larger ships to home waters to protect the Australian
   mainland from Japanese attack, while several small ships remained in
   the Mediterranean. From 1940 onwards there was considerable Axis naval
   activity in Australian waters first from German commerce raiders and
   submarines and later by the Imperial Japanese navy.

   On November 19, 1941, the Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney and the
   German auxiliary cruiser HSK Kormoran engaged each other in the Indian
   Ocean, off Western Australia. The two ships sank each other and the
   Sydney was lost with all 645 hands. The majority of the Kormoran's crew
   were rescued and became prisoners of war. Neither wreck has been found
   and the battle and sinking remain the subject of much controversy.

   In March 1942 a joint ABDA naval force meet a Japanese invasion force
   in the Java Sea, the engagement became known as the Battle of Java Sea.
   The Leander class cruiser, HMAS Perth and the American heavy cruiser
   USS Houston survived the opening battle. Perth and Houston both
   attempted to move through the Sunda Strait to Tjilatjap. The Perth was
   torpedoed by Japanese destroyers during the Battle of Sunda Strait on 1
   March 1942, and sank with the loss of 350 of her crew and three
   civilians. While 324 of Perth's crew survived the sinking and were
   taken prisoner by the Japanese, 106 died in captivity before the end of
   the war. The loss of Perth was the second major loss suffered by the
   RAN at the hands of the Japanese, its loss had a major psychological
   effect on the Australian people.

   On 2 May 1942 two ships of the RAN joined a large American force in the
   Battle of the Coral Sea; HMAS Australia and the HMAS Hobart, both ships
   survived the battle. The Battle of the Coral Sea averted a Japanese
   attack on Port Moresby and possibly the Australian mainland. In late
   May and early June, 1942, a group of five Imperial Japanese Navy
   submarines made a series of attacks on Sydney and the nearby port of
   Newcastle. These attacks are one of the best known examples of Axis
   naval activity in Australian waters during World War II. On the night
   of May 31- June 1, the submarines launched three Ko-hyoteki class
   midget submarines against Allied shipping in Sydney Harbour. A torpedo
   exploded under the depot ship HMAS Kuttabul, killing 21. On June 8, two
   of the submarines shelled Sydney and Newcastle, with little effect.

   On 1 December 1942 HMAS Armidale while attempting to land commandos off
   Betano was attacked by thirteen enemy Japanese aircraft and sank with
   the loss of 40 of her crew and 60 men of the Netherlands East Indies
   Army who were embarked. During the engagement Ordinary Seaman Teddy
   Sheean manned an Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun and was wounded by strafing
   Japanese planes, he went down with the ship, still strapped into the
   gun and still shooting at the attacking aircraft.

   The RAN's biggest single ship loss of the war was that of the sister
   ship to Australia, HMAS Canberra at the Battle of Savo Island, in
   August 1942. In the early hours of the morning of 9 August 1942 the RAN
   heavy cruiser HMAS Canberra was severely damaged off Guadalcanal in a
   surprise attack by a powerful Japanese naval force. Canberra was hit 24
   times in less than two minutes and 84 of her crew were killed including
   Captain Frank Getting. Following an order to abandon ship Canberra was
   sunk the next day by a torpedo from a US destroyer. Following the loss
   of Canberra, the British Government approved the transfer of HMS
   Shropshire to Australia as a replacement and the ship commissioned into
   the Royal Australian Navy as HMAS Shropshire on 20 April 1943. American
   President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wished to commemorate the loss of
   Canberra and made a special request that an under construction American
   heavy cruiser be renamed as a tribute. A Baltimore class cruiser
   previously designated as Pittsburgh was renamed, and USS Canberra was
   launched on 19 April 1943.

   In October 1944 three RAN warships, Australia, Shropshire and Ariadne
   took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Leyte Gulf also saw the first
   use of kamikaze aircraft by the Japanese. The Australian heavy cruiser
   Australia was hit on October 21 becoming the first Allied ship hit by a
   kamikaze aircraft.

   Ten vessels of the Royal Australian Navy were present at the Instrument
   of Surrender of Japan in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945; these were the
   Ballarat, Cessnock, Gascoyne, Hobart, Ipswich, Napier, Nizam, Pirie,
   Shropshire and Warramunga.

Cold War

   Following World War II, the RAN reduced its surface fleet but continued
   to expand in other ways, acquiring two Royal Navy Majestic class
   aircraft carriers then under construction ( HMS Majestic and HMS
   Terrible) to build up a Fleet Air Arm. In the 1960s the RAN began to
   move away from commissioning British designs; the last major British
   design used was the Type 12 frigate, which formed the basis of the
   "River" class frigates. When it was decided that the RAN should
   commission a destroyer armed with guided missiles, the obvious British
   design was the "County" class; however, the RAN had reservations
   regarding the gas turbine propulsion, the Seaslug missile system, and
   being able to adapt the design to Australian needs. So, the Australian
   government chose the steam turbine powered Charles F. Adams class
   destroyer, armed with the Tartar missile as the basis for its Perth
   class, the first major US warship design chosen for the RAN.

   By the mid-late 1960s, the RAN was at the zenith of its operational
   capabilities; it was capable of dispatching a full carrier battle group
   in support of major operations by having in service an aircraft
   carrier, three large area defence destroyers of the Perth class, six
   modern "River" class frigates and four Oberon class submarines.

Roles in post-war conflicts

   With the retreat of British forces west of the Suez Canal in the 1960s,
   the RAN began to take a more defensive role, and in co-operation with
   the United States, allied though the ANZUS treaty. The RAN saw service
   in many of the world's post war conflicts including Korea, Vietnam, and
   the Indonesian Confrontation.

Korea

   On 27 June 1950 the United Nations Security Council called on member
   nations to aid South Korea. On 29 June Prime Minister Robert Menzies
   announced that the frigate HMAS Shoalhaven, stationed in Japan, and the
   destroyer HMAS Bataan, in Hong Kong would be placed under UN command in
   Korea. On 1 July only one day after President Truman committed American
   ground forces to Korea the first Australian operation in Korea took
   place, HMAS Shoalhaven moved from Japan to Pusan escorting an American
   ammunition ship. On 27 July 1950 the destroyer HMAS Warramunga was also
   deployed.

   During the Landing at Wonsan in October 1950 HMAS Warramunga provided
   gunfire support during the landing of U.S. X Corps. During the mass
   evacuation of troops and refugees in the city of Hungnam in December
   1950 HMAS Bataan and Warramunga assisted in the evacuation. In October
   1951 Sydney arrived in Korean Waters to replace HMS Glory for a three
   month tour. Sydney carried two squadron of Sea Furies - 805 Squadron
   RAN and 808 Squadron RAN, and 817 Squadron RAN equipped with Fireflies.
   The Sydney returned to Japan having lost only 9 aircraft with 3 pilots
   killed and having launched over 2700 missions from her flight deck.
   Later in the war 9 ship of the RAN participated in the naval blockade
   of North Korea.

Malaya

   The Malayan Emergency was declared on 18 June 1948 brought about by a
   rise in Communist guerrillas in Malaysia. Australia as a member of the
   Southeast Asia Treaty Organization first deployed troops in 1950. The
   first ships of the RAN to arrive in the area were the "Tribal" class
   destroyers HMAS Warramunga and Arunta in June 1955. Other ships that
   served in Malayan waters during the Emergency included the ships Anzac,
   Melbourne, Quadrant, Queenborough, Quiberon, Quickmatch, Sydney,
   Tobruk, Vampire, Vendetta and Voyager. During the period ships of the
   RAN also served with the Far East Strategic Reserve, between 1955 and
   1960 a total of 13 RAN ships served with the Strategic Reserve. Serving
   as part of a larger naval organisation provided valuable experience for
   the ships of the RAN. Seven members of the RAN died while serving
   during the Emergency and with the Strategic Reserve.

   The decision to deploy the RAN to the area was due to the strong
   anti-communist feeling in Australia and the western world in the 1950s
   and 60s. The primary role of the RAN was to provide a deterrent to
   further Communist aggression in South East Asia. The secondary role was
   to assist in the maintenance of the security of the Federation of
   Malaya by participating in operations against the Communist Terrorists.

Indonesia

   In response to the Indonesian invasion of Borneo and Malaya in 1963
   Australia increased its presence in the region. At the outbreak of
   hostilities the RAN had two frigates, HMAS Yarra and HMAS Parramatta on
   duty in the area. As tension mounted, Australia increased its presence
   by sending Sydney, Vampire, Vendetta, Duchess and the Derwent to the
   area. On May 19, 1964 the 16th Minesweeping Squadron comprising six Ton
   class minesweeper was also deployed.

   On 13 December 1964 HMAS Teal whilst operating as part of the Singapore
   Strait patrol, was fired upon with automatic weapons by an unlit
   vessel. The vessel was overpowered and arrested by Teal following a
   further small arms engagement that resulted in the deaths of three
   Indonesian crew members. On 23 February 1965 Teal was again involved in
   another engagement, she detected an unlit vessel off Cape Rachado. The
   suspicious vessel was closed on and illuminated, and revealed nine
   armed men in uniform who surrendered immediately upon challenge. HMAS
   Hawk became the second vessel of the 16th Minesweeping Squadron to see
   action when on 13 March 1966 while patrolling off Raffles Light came
   under fire from an Indonesian shore battery. Eleven high explosive
   rounds were fired at the ship some landing within 200 yards of the
   vessel, Hawk withdrew from the area at speed. The following morning
   Hawk intercepted a sampan with five Indonesians on board who were
   promptly arrested.

   When Indonesian forces crossed the border into Sebatik Island, Sabah on
   28 June 1965, HMAS Yarra was called on to carry out bombardments
   disrupting the withdrawal of the Indonesians. Yarra carried out two
   more bombardments of the border area on 5 and 10 July. During three
   runs Yarra fired a total of 70 rounds on the enemy. On 13 August 1966
   an agreement concluded between Indonesia and Malaysia brought an end to
   the conflict.

   On 10 February 1964 during a night exercise off Jervis Bay the
   destroyer HMAS Voyager cut across the bow of the aircraft carrier HMAS
   Melbourne. Voyager was cut in two by the impact and sank with the loss
   of 81 of her crew and one civilian dockyard employee. The Captain R. J.
   Robertson of the Melbourne was cleared of any responsibility during a
   court martial but was transferred to a shore posting. Later inquiries
   found that the skipper of the Voyager was drunk while on duty, this is
   a controversial finding and is disputed by many. After the loss of
   Voyager HMAS Duchess was loaned to the RAN from the Royal Navy. The
   collision between the Melbourne and the Voyager remains the greatest
   loss of life suffered by the RAN during peace time.

Vietnam War

   Ships of the Royal Australian Navy were stationed on continuous
   operational service in Vietnam between 1965 and 1972, in total 18 ships
   served in Vietnam waters during the war. During this period the Navy
   performed a wide variety of operational tasks at sea, ashore and in the
   air. The RAN's primary contribution consisted of destroyers, Fleet Air
   Arm personnel attached to a United States Army helicopter company and
   No. 9 Squadron RAAF, a Clearance Diving Team, and a logistic support
   force consisting of transport and escort ships. Other RAN personnel
   served ashore in medical teams or performed staff duties at the
   Australian Embassy in Saigon or the 1st Australian Task Force
   Headquarters in Nui Dat.

   The RAN did not deploy operationally until 1965, but in 1962 HMAS
   Vampire and HMAS Quickmatch made goodwill visits to Saigon. They were
   followed a year later by similar visits by HMAS Quiberon and HMAS
   Queensborough. In 1967 HMAS Hobart became the first RAN destroyer to be
   operationally deployed to Vietnam. Hobart served three tours in Vietnam
   from March to September in 1967, 1968 and 1970. During her operation
   she fired 10,000 rounds at 1000 shore targets and came under fire
   around 10 times. Hobart was awarded a US Navy Unit Commendation in
   recognition of her service in Vietnam while her sister ship Perth
   received both the US Navy Unit Commendation and the US Meritorious Unit
   Commendation. In their five years service in Vietnam, the four gunline
   destroyers; Perth, Brisbane, Hobart and Vendetta steamed over 397,000
   miles and fired 102,546 rounds.

   The aircraft carrier HMAS Sydney was converted for troopship duties in
   the early 1960s and began her first voyage to Vietnam in May 1965,
   transporting the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, from Sydney
   to Vung Tau in southern Vietnam. Sydney became known as the Vung Tau
   Ferry and made 25 voyages to Vietnam carrying 16,094 troops, 5,753
   deadweight tons (5,845 t) of cargo and 2,375 vehicles.

   In 1969 HMAS Melbourne while performing exercises with the United
   States Navy in the South China Sea again rammed and sunk another
   destroyer. The USS Frank E. Evans was cut in half by Melbourne. Her bow
   sank instantly, taking 74 of her crew down with it. Evans was stricken
   from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1969. Again the Melbourne's
   captain was cleared of any responsibility for the disaster, but he met
   the same fate as Melbourne's previous captain and was transferred to a
   shore posting. HMAS Melbourne is credited as being the only warship to
   ram and sink two friendly destroyers in peace time.

   In April 1971 Prime Minister John Gorton announced that Australian
   forces in Vietnam would be reduced. This led to the withdrawal of the
   clearance divers in May and the Fleet Air Arm in June. The final RAN
   destroyer on the gunline, Brisbane, returned to Sydney on 15 October
   1971. The Whitlam government withdrew all Australian forces from and
   stopped military aid to South Vietnam. HMAS Jeparit returned to Sydney
   on 11 March 1972 and was followed the next day by HMAS Sydney. During
   the 10 years that the RAN was involved in the war, eight officers and
   sailors were killed and another 46 were either wounded or suffered
   other injuries.

Cyclone Tracy

   During the morning of 25 December 1974 Tropical Cyclone Tracy struck
   the city of Darwin killing 71 people and causing $4 billion of damage
   (1998 AUD). In response to the cyclone the RAN embarked upon the
   largest peacetime disaster relief operation in its history, involving
   13 ships, 11 aircraft and some 3000 personnel.

   When Tracy struck Darwin the RAN had a total of 351 personnel based in
   the city along with four Attack class patrol boats, the small number of
   men limited the capability of the RAN to render immediate assistance to
   the citizens of Darwin. Of the four Attack class patrol boats based in
   Darwin all four were damaged in some way by the storm. HMAS Arrow sunk
   under Stokes Hill Wharf with the loss of two sailors, HMAS Attack was
   beached by the force of the winds at Doctor's Gully and HMAS Advance
   and HMAS Assail were slightly damaged. Land based naval installations
   were also heavily damaged by the cyclone, Darwin Naval Headquarters was
   destroyed, as was large sections of the patrol boat base and the
   married quarters. The oil fuel supply installation and naval
   communications station at HMAS Coonawarra were also damaged. The
   initial RAN relief which was limited to search and rescue in the area
   of Darwin Harbour and Melville Island was hindered by the lack of
   reliable communications.

   As the severity of the disaster was realised a naval task force under
   Rear Admiral R.E. Wells was established to render aid to the people of
   Darwin, the operation became known as Operation Help Darwin. A general
   recall was issued to all personnel, of the 2700 Sydney based sailors on
   leave at the time some 2200 were able to return to their ships,
   volunteers filled any vacant positions onboard. The first RAN assets
   began to arrived in Darwin on 26 December, a Hawker-Siddeley 748 from
   851 Squadron landed at Darwin Airport carrying blood transfusion
   equipment and Red Cross workers, followed shortly by another HS748
   carrying Clearance Diving Team One (CDT 1). Ships also began departing
   for Darwin on 26 December, HMAS Balikpapan and HMAS Betano sailed from
   Brisbane, HMAS Flinders sailed from Cairns and HMAS Melbourne, Brisbane
   and Stuart sailed from Sydney. The following day HMAS Hobart, Stalwart,
   Supply and Vendetta sailed from Sydney and HMAS Brunei and Tarakan
   departed Brisbane. Nine Wessex helicopters from 725 and 817 Squadron
   were embarked on Melbourne and Stalwart.

   The RAN taskforce was tasked with the responsibility of clearing and
   restoring 4740 houses in the northern suburbs of Nightcliff, Rapid
   Creek and Casuarina. RAN aircraft continued to ferry supplies and
   personnel into Darwin and evacuate displaced Darwin citizens. Some
   displaced residents were housed in the many naval bases located on
   Sydney Harbour and HMAS Moreton in Brisbane.

   The first vessels HMAS Brisbane and Flinders arrived in Darwin on 31
   December, Flinders surveyed the approaches to Darwin ensuring the
   safety of the taskforce, while Brisbane landed working parties and
   established communications. The entire task force had arrived in Darwin
   by 13 January 1975, the force brought more than 3,000 personnel to the
   city. Men of the task force usually worked in small working parties of
   10 to 15 men depending on the task.

   The Men and Women of the RAN made a significant contribution to the
   relief effort; from January 1 to January 30 naval personnel spent
   17,979 man days ashore, with up to 1200 ashore at one time. Some 1593
   housing blocks were cleared and government and private facilities
   cleaned up. Westland Wessex helicopters transported 7,832 passengers,
   110,912 kg of supplies and freight and made 2,505 landings. The
   Hawker-Siddeley 748 aircraft made a total of 14 return flights to
   Darwin and carried out 485 passengers and brought in 22,680 kg of
   freight. Vessels of the task force began to depart Darwin as early as 7
   January, with the last vessels HMAS Brisbane and Stalwart departing on
   31 January. With the departure of the majority of the RAN personnel the
   command of the relief operation was turned over to the Commandant of
   the Army's 7th Military District.

Pacific Patrol Boat Program

   Following the introduction of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the
   Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of many
   coastal nations was increased from 12 nautical miles (NM) to 200 NM.
   The sudden expansion of responsibility dramatically increased the area
   of ocean requiring surveillance, monitoring and policing by these
   nations, increasing the strain on existing maritime patrol resources,
   and highlighting the need for countries without a maritime patrol force
   to obtain one, especially in the South West Pacific area.

   In 1979 the Australian and New Zealand governments, at the request of
   Pacific island nations, sent defence representatives into the
   South-West Pacific region to assess surveillance and maritime patrol
   requirements. The governments of a number of the Pacific nations
   expressed their concern about the need for a suitable naval patrol
   force to meet their new surveillance requirements. The Australian
   government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP),
   to provide suitable patrol vessels, training and infrastructure to
   island nations in the region. The Pacific Patrol Boat Systems Program
   Office was created within the Minor War Vessels Branch of the RAN
   procurement organisation.

   The tender for the vessels was released in August 1984 and was awarded
   to Australian Shipbuilding Industries Pty Ltd (now Tenix Western
   Australia) in September 1985. The frist of ten vessels was to be
   delivered in early 1987. The first vessel, HMPNGS Tarangau, was
   officially handed over to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force on 16 May
   1987. Over the course of the project the number of participating
   countries increased. By the end of the construction phase of the
   project a total of 22 boats delivered to 12 countries, compared to the
   original order of 10 boats for 8 countries. In total, the project cost
   for 22 vessels and associated support was $A155.25 million.

   The RAN never operated the Pacific-class patrol boat (PPB) the project
   has given the RAN a number of advantages in the Pacific region. The
   introduction of self-reliant patrol forces throughout the region has
   eased the strain on Australia’s own maritime patrol force. Cooperation
   between Australia and its Pacific neighbours has allowed for a greater
   allocation of RAN patrol boats to protecting Australia’s maritime
   resources, patrolling the Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC), and
   conducting border protection operations. The PPB's have recently
   undergone a mid life refit which could potentially see them operating
   in the region until at least 2027.

Two Ocean Navy Policy

   The main role of the Royal Australian Navy in the two decades following
   the end of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War was supporting
   Australian diplomatic initiatives. In line with this goal the RAN
   exercised with the navies of Australia's allies and provided support to
   civil authorities in Australia and the South Pacific. The RAN's main
   military concern from the 1970s was the activities of the Soviet Navy
   in the Indian Ocean. These concerns lead to increased cooperation with
   the United States Navy and the development of the RAN's main base in
   Western Australia, HMAS Stirling.

   During the late 1970s the RAN replaced many of its aging ships with
   modern equivalents. While it was planned to purchase the British
   aircraft carrier HMS Invincible to replace Melbourne, Britain's offer
   of the carrier was withdrawn after the Falklands War and the Melbourne
   was decommissioned without replacement in 1982 and the Fleet Air Arm
   retired almost all of its fixed wing aircraft on 30 June 1983.

   In 1987 the Hawke Government's Defence White Paper called for the RAN
   to become a more self reliant two-ocean navy with major fleet bases in
   New South Wales and Western Australia. The plan called for the
   expansion of Stirling on Garden Island and Jervis Bay to accommodate an
   expanded RAN combat surface and submarine fleets. The plan originally
   called for the major combat units and submarines to be split between
   the two fleet bases, providing similar capabilities on both sided of
   the continent. The proposed Jervis Bay naval base never became a
   reality; Fleet Base East was built up around HMAS Kuttabul in Sydney
   while HMAS Stirling is home to half the surface fleet and the entire
   submarine fleet. The rationale behind the policy included. The
   possibility of savings in fuel and maintenance that would result from
   Indian Ocean deployments beginning their journey from Western Australia
   rather than New South Wales. The report also classed the Indian Ocean
   as an area where contingencies might arise. The new facilities would
   increase Australia's worth to the United States, particularly to do
   with maintenance of submarines. Expansion at Jervis Bay would allow
   intensified east coast visits by the US Pacific Fleet, and its nuclear
   warship visits would not run into as much opposition as they do in
   Sydney and Melbourne.

   The 1987 White Paper was seen by many as an attempt to strengthen
   Australia's relationship with the United States which was damaged by
   New Zealands stance against nuclear weapons in its ports. In line with
   this policy the RAN was structured to become more self-reliant and its
   activities during the late 1980s were focused on operating within
   Australia's local region.

   The Two Ocean Policy remains in place today and is supported by the
   current government and the opposition. The success of the policy is
   especially evident at HMAS Stirling. The base is thriving and its
   location both in a global and local context gives it an advantage over
   Fleet Base East. It has been suggested that all 8 units of the Anzac
   class be relocated to Stirling, this would create an easier training
   environment for sailors and would lead to significant cost savings.

Post Cold War

The Gulf Wars

   Australia's contribution to the 1991 Gulf War centered around a Naval
   Task Group which formed part of the multi-national fleet in the Persian
   Gulf and Gulf of Oman. In addition, medical teams were deployed aboard
   a US hospital ship and a naval clearance diving team took part in
   de-mining Kuwait’s port facilities at the end of the war. Over the
   period from September 6, 1990 to September 4, 1991 the RAN deployed a
   total of 6 ships to the area they were Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin,
   Success, Sydney and Westralia. Clearance Diving Team 3 operated in the
   theatre from 27 January 1991 to 10 May 1991. It was involved in mine
   clearing operations in Kuwait from 5 March to 19 April 1991.

   After the end of the first Gulf War the Royal Australian Navy
   periodically deployed a ship in the Gulf to assist in maintaining
   sanctions against Iraq. This deployment is still ongoing today.

   Prior to the outbreak of Second Gulf War the Australian naval force in
   the Persian Gulf continued to enforce the sanctions against Iraq. These
   operations were conducted by boarding parties from the RAN warships and
   the AP-3 Orion patrol aircraft.

   Upon the outbreak of war the RAN's focus shifted to supporting the
   coalition land forces and clearing the approaches to Iraqi ports. HMAS
   Anzac provided gunfire support to Royal Marines during fighting on the
   Al-Faw Peninsula and the Clearance Diving Team took part in clearing
   the approaches to Umm Qasr. Boarding operations continued during the
   war, and on 20 March boarding parties from the HMAS Kanimbla seized an
   Iraqi ship carrying 86 naval mines.

HMAS Westralia

   On 5 May 1998 a fire broke out onboard HMAS Westralia while off the
   Western Australia coast. The fire was caused by the rupture of a
   flexible fuel line (one of a number used to replace rigid hoses) on
   cylinder number nine starboard engine. This sprayed diesel fuel onto a
   hot indicator cock, which ignited a spray fire. The resulting fire
   caused the deaths of four people onboard. Following the fire the
   Australian Government and the RAN began a major investigation known as
   the Westralia Board of Inquiry. The enquiry found that the RAN and the
   contractor Australian Defence Industries (ADI) did not critically
   examine their course of action and that key personnel in the RAN and
   the contractor were insufficiently trained and qualified. The inquiry
   also found that the hoses were not properly designed and were unfit for
   the intended purpose. In 2005 ADI was fined $75,000 for failing to
   provide a safe workplace. Seven sailors who were apparently severely
   traumatised by the fire have also sued ADI and sub contractor Jetrock.
   In August 2006 the Australian Government decided to accept liability
   after it reached settlement with the ADI and Jetrock. The seven sailors
   stand to receive compensation totalling up to $10 million.

East Timor

   During the Australian lead United Nations peacekeeping mission to East
   Timor in 1999 known as INTERFET, The RAN deployed a total of 14 ships
   to the mission. The Adelaide, Anzac, Balikpapan, Brunei, Darwin,
   Farncomb, Jervis Bay, Labuan, Success, Sydney, Tarakan, Tobruk, Waller
   and Westralia. The RAN played a vital role in transporting troops and
   providing protection to transports and were vital to the success of
   INTERFET.

   The RAN returned to East Timor in 2006 under Operation Astute the
   United Nations-authorised, Australian-led military deployment to East
   Timor to quell unrest and return stability during the 2006 East Timor
   crisis. The Royal Australian Navy deployed the Amphibious Ready Group
   including the ships; Kanimbla, Manoora, Tobruk (until approximately 8
   June), Balikpapan, Tarakan, Success (until 28 May). The navy also
   deployed the Adelaide class frigate HMAS Adelaide (until 28 May). The
   Fleet Air Arm contributed One S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter from 816
   Squadron RAN (until 28 May) and Two Sea King helicopters from 817
   Squadron RAN. The Royal Australian Navy force committed to Operation
   Astute is apparently the largest amphibious task force in the Navy's
   history.

Solomon Islands

   On 24 July 2003 HMAS Manoora arrived off Honiara marking the beginning
   of Operation ANODE, Australia's contribution to the Regional Assistance
   Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The deployment of a 2,200
   strong multinational force followed several years of unrest in the
   Solomon Islands. Manoora was soon joined by HMAS Hawkesbury, Labuan,
   Wewak and Whyalla. Following the initial deployment two vessels were
   generally kept on station in the area. By the time the RAN deployment
   ended, some 19 Australian warships had taken part. The last ship to
   leave was HMAS Fremantle which sailed home in October 2004.

   Operation ANODE was not the first time units of the RAN had been
   deployed to the Solomon Islands, ANODE was unique in that the navy's
   primary role was to support and facilitate the work of the
   Participating Police Force (PPF). Moreover, in addition to being the
   first time the RAN had supported a police lead mission. Operation Anode
   and RAMSI is one of the latest examples of the role Australia and
   specifically the RAN is playing in stableising the Pacific region.

Modern Navy

   The Royal Australian Navy today is a medium sized modern navy in world
   terms but is one of the strongest navies in the Asia Pacific Region.
   Today the combat fleet of the RAN is made up of 8 Anzac class frigates,
   5 Adelaide class frigates, 13 patrol boats of the Armidale and
   Fremantle classes and 6 Collins class submarines. The RAN also
   comprises a large amphibious and supply force in order to transport the
   Australian Army and to resupply the combat arm of the navy. The RAN is
   divided into 7 Force Element Groups (FEG); Surface Combatants,
   Amphibious Warfare Forces and Afloat Support Force, Naval Aviation,
   Submarine Force, Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving, Patrol Boat Force
   and the Hydrographic Force. The FEG's were formed to manage the
   operations of the separate sections of the RAN in a more efficient way.

   The modern RAN began to form during the late 1970s when the Fraser
   Government announced the purchase of 4 Oliver Hazard Perry class
   frigates all to be built in America; in 1980 they announced an
   additional 2 vessels both to be built in Australia. The 15 vessels of
   the Fremantle class have been Australia's lead patrol boat since 1979
   replacing the Attack Class, all Attack class vessels were
   decommissioned by 1985. The Fremantle class is itself being replaced
   with the Armidale class; today only 5 of the 15 Fremantle class ships
   remain in service.

   The Collins class is the newest class of Australian submarines, built
   in Australia for the Royal Australian Navy. They were built by the
   Australian Submarine Corporation in Adelaide, South Australia. They
   replace much older Oberon class submarines in the Australian fleet. The
   first vessel HMAS Collins was laid down in 1990 and commissioned in
   1996, today all six vessels of the class are operational and based HMAS
   Stirling in Western Australia.

   The Anzac class is today the main fleet unit of the Royal Australian
   Navy, with the last of the 8 ships, HMAS Perth commissioned on the 26
   August 2006 and two ships also constructed for the Royal New Zealand
   Navy. These ships were built in both New Zealand and Australia with
   there final fitout in Williamstown, Victoria.

   The amphibious and supply arm of the RAN is made up of; 2 Kanimbla
   class landing platform, one heavy landing ship HMAS Tobruk, 6
   Balikpapan class landing craft, 2 Leeuwin class survey ships, 4 Paluma
   class survey vessels, one fleet oiler, HMAS Sirius and the Dual Stores
   Replenishment Vessel HMAS Success. The RAN also has 6 Huon class
   minehunters.

   The Royal Australian Navy maintains several bases around Australia.
   Under the RAN's Two Ocean Policy two of these HMAS Stirling (Fleet Base
   West) and HMAS Kuttabul (Fleet Base East) are the base for all major
   fleet unit of the RAN. The majority of the patrol boat and amphibious
   fleets are located at HMAS Cairns and HMAS Coonawarra while all Fleet
   Air Arm squadrons are located at HMAS Albatross in New South Wales.

The future of the RAN

   In 2000 a major white paper was produced by the Australian government
   which set out a program of defence spending that will see significant
   improvements to the RAN's fleet and capabilities.

   The most significant current project is Sea4000 the procurement of
   three Hobart class destroyers, which will replace the Adelaide class..
   These ships will be fitted with the AEGIS combat system, and will be
   based on either the United States Arleigh Burke design design or the
   Spanish F100 design. The class has a planned in service date of 2013,
   with the three units to be named Hobart, Brisbane and Sydney.

   The RAN is currently in the process of replacing its patrol boat fleet.
   The 15 Fremantle class patrol boats which entered service in 1979 are
   currently being replaced with 14 Armidale class vessels. Designed and
   built by Austal Ships, the lead ship of the Armidale class, HMAS
   Armidale was commissioned into the RAN in June 2005. The entire
   Armidale class fleet is expected to be in service by late 2007 and will
   provide greater flexibility and capabilities to the RAN.

   In August 2005 the Australian Government passed approval for the
   acquisition of two Canberra class large amphibious ships; these will
   displace over 20,000 tonnes and have the capability to carry over 1,000
   troops and will potentially be able to operate fixed wing aircraft. The
   project is expected to cost between $1.5 and $2 billion Australian
   dollars and be completed by around 2014.The new ships will be named
   Canberra and Adelaide.
