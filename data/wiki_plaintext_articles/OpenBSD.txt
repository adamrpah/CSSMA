        Computer insecurity

   OpenBSD is a freely available Unix-like computer operating system
   descended from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix derivative
   developed at the University of California, Berkeley. It was forked from
   NetBSD (the oldest of the three most popular BSD-based operating
   systems still active today, with FreeBSD being the other) by project
   leader Theo de Raadt in late 1995. The project is widely known for the
   developers' insistence on open source code and quality documentation;
   uncompromising position on software licensing; and focus on security
   and code correctness. The project is coordinated from de Raadt's home
   in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Its logo and mascot is Puffy, a
   pufferfish.

   OpenBSD includes a number of security features absent or optional in
   other operating systems and has a tradition of developers auditing the
   source code for software bugs and security problems. The project
   maintains strict policies on licensing and prefers the open source BSD
   licence and its variantsâ€”in the past this has led to a comprehensive
   licence audit and moves to remove or replace code under licences found
   less acceptable.

   In common with most other BSD-based operating systems, the OpenBSD
   kernel and userland programs, such as the shell and common tools like
   cat and ps, are developed together in a single source repository.
   Third-party software is available as binary packages or may be built
   from source using the ports collection.

   OpenBSD currently runs on 16 different hardware platforms, including
   the DEC Alpha, Intel i386, Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC, AMD AMD64 and
   Motorola 68000 processors, Apple's PowerPC machines, Sun SPARC and
   SPARC64-based computers, the VAX and the Sharp Zaurus.

   In December 1994, NetBSD co-founder Theo de Raadt was asked to resign
   his position as a senior developer and member of the NetBSD core team,
   and his access to the source code repository was revoked. The reason
   for this is not wholly clear, although there are claims that it was due
   to personality clashes within the NetBSD project and on its mailing
   lists. De Raadt has been criticized for having a sometimes abrasive
   personality: in his book, Free For All, Peter Wayner claims that de
   Raadt "began to rub some people the wrong way" before the split from
   NetBSD; Linus Torvalds has described him as "difficult;" and an
   interviewer admits to being "apprehensive" before meeting him. Many
   have different feelings: the same interviewer describes de Raadt's
   "transformation" on founding OpenBSD and his "desire to take care of
   his team," some find his straightforwardness refreshing, and few deny
   he is a talented coder and security "guru."

   In October 1995, de Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project forked from
   NetBSD 1.0. The initial release, OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996,
   followed in October of the same year by OpenBSD 2.0. Since then, the
   project has followed a schedule of a release every six months, each of
   which is maintained and supported for one year. The latest release,
   OpenBSD 4.0, appeared on November 1, 2006.

   Just how widely OpenBSD is used is hard to ascertain: the developers do
   not collect and publish usage statistics and there are few other
   sources of information. The nascent BSD Certification project performed
   a usage survey which revealed that 32.8% of BSD users (1420 of 4330
   respondents) were using OpenBSD, placing it second of the four major
   BSD variants, behind FreeBSD with 77.0% and ahead of NetBSD with 16.3%.
   The Distrowatch website, well-known in the Linux community and often
   used as a reference for popularity, publishes page hits for each of the
   Linux distributions and other operating systems it covers. As of August
   13, 2006 it places OpenBSD in 48th place, but fairly close to the
   average with 114 hits per day. FreeBSD is in 12th place with 532 hits
   per day and a number of Linux distributions range between them. From
   these statistics, it is possible to conclude that OpenBSD is a
   substantial presence in the BSD world, with somewhere around a third of
   the userbase of FreeBSD, and is not unnoticed in the wider open source
   and free software operating system community.

Licensing

   A goal of the OpenBSD project is to "maintain the spirit of the
   original Berkeley Unix copyrights," which permitted a "relatively
   un-encumbered Unix source distribution." To this end, the Internet
   Systems Consortium (ISC) licence, a simplified version of the BSD
   licence with wording removed that is unnecessary under the Berne
   convention, is preferred for new code, but the MIT or BSD licences are
   accepted. The widely used GNU General Public License is considered
   overly restrictive in comparison with these: code licensed under it,
   and other licences the project sees as undesirable, is no longer
   accepted for addition to the base system. In addition, existing code
   under such licences is actively replaced or relicensed when possible,
   except in some cases, such as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), where
   there is no suitable replacement and creating one would be
   time-consuming and impractical. Despite this, OpenBSD has made some
   significant strides in this area: of particular note is the development
   of OpenSSH, based on the original SSH suite and developed further by
   the OpenBSD team. It first appeared in OpenBSD 2.6 and is now the
   single most popular SSH implementation, available as standard or as a
   package on many operating systems. Also worth mentioning is the
   development, after licence restrictions were imposed on IPFilter, of
   the PF packet filter, which first appeared in OpenBSD 3.0 and is now
   available in DragonFly BSD, NetBSD and FreeBSD; more recently, OpenBSD
   releases have seen the GPL licensed tools diff, grep, gzip, bc, dc, nm
   and size replaced with BSD licensed equivalents. OpenBSD developers are
   also behind OpenBGPD, OpenOSPFD, OpenNTPD and OpenCVS, BSD licensed
   alternatives to existing software.

   In June of 2001, triggered by concerns over Darren Reed's modification
   of IPFilter's licence wording, a systematic licence audit of the
   OpenBSD ports and source trees was undertaken. Code in more than a
   hundred files throughout the system was found to be unlicensed,
   ambiguously licensed or in use against the terms of the licence. To
   ensure that all licences were properly adhered to, an attempt was made
   to contact all the relevant copyright holders: some pieces of code were
   removed, many were replaced, and others, including the multicast
   routing tools, mrinfo and map-mbone, which were licensed by Xerox for
   research only, were relicensed so that OpenBSD could continue to use
   them. Also of note during this audit was the removal of all software
   produced by Daniel J. Bernstein from the OpenBSD ports tree. At the
   time, Bernstein requested that all modified versions of his code be
   approved by him prior to redistribution, a requirement to which OpenBSD
   developers were unwilling to devote time or effort. The removal led to
   a clash with Bernstein who felt the removal of his software to be
   uncalled for and cited the Netscape web browser as much less free,
   accusing the OpenBSD developers of hypocrisy for permitting Netscape to
   remain while removing his software. The OpenBSD project's stance was
   that Netscape, although not open source, had licence conditions that
   were much easier to meet; they asserted that Bernstein's demand for
   control of derivatives would lead to a great deal of additional work
   and that removal was the most appropriate way to comply with his
   requirements. At present, Daniel J. Bernstein's software is still
   absent from the ports tree.

Security and code auditing

   Shortly after OpenBSD's creation, Theo de Raadt was contacted by a
   local security software company named Secure Networks, Inc. or SNI.
   They were developing a "network security auditing tool" called Ballista
   (later renamed to Cybercop Scanner after SNI was purchased by Network
   Associates) which was intended to find and attempt to exploit possible
   software security flaws. This coincided well with de Raadt's own
   interest in security, so the two agreed to cooperate, a relationship
   that was of particular use leading up to the release of OpenBSD 2.3 and
   helped to form the focal point of the project: OpenBSD developers would
   attempt to do what was right, proper or secure, even at the cost of
   ease, speed or functionality. As bugs within OpenBSD became harder to
   find and exploit, the security company found that it was too difficult,
   or not cost effective, to handle such obscure problems. After years of
   cooperation, the two parties decided that their goals together had been
   met and parted ways.

   Until June 2002, the OpenBSD website featured the slogan:


   OpenBSD

     No remote computer hole in the default install, in nearly 6 years.


   OpenBSD

   In June 2002, Mark Dowd of Internet Security Systems disclosed a bug in
   the OpenSSH code implementing challenge-response authentication. This
   was the first and, so far, only vulnerability discovered in the OpenBSD
   default installation allowing an attacker remote access to the root
   accountâ€”it was extremely serious, partly due to the widespread use of
   OpenSSH by that time: the bug affected a considerable number of other
   operating systems. This problem necessitated the adjustment of the
   slogan on the OpenBSD website to:


   OpenBSD

     Only one remote hole in the default install, in more than 8 years.


   OpenBSD

   This statement has been criticized because little is enabled in a
   default install of OpenBSD and releases have included software that was
   later found to have remote holes; however, the project maintains that
   the slogan is intended to refer to a default install and that it is
   correct by that measure. One of the fundamental ideas behind OpenBSD is
   a drive for systems to be simple, clean and secure by default. For
   example, OpenBSD's minimal defaults fit in with standard computer
   security practice of enabling as few services as possible on production
   machines, and the project uses open source and code auditing practices
   argued to be important elements of a security system.

   OpenBSD includes a large number of specific features designed to
   improve security, including API and toolchain alterations, such as the
   strlcpy and strlcat functions and a static bounds checker; memory
   protection techniques to guard against invalid accesses, such as
   ProPolice, StackGhost, the W^X (W xor X) page protection features, as
   well as alterations to malloc; and cryptography and randomization
   features, including network stack enhancements and the addition of the
   Blowfish cipher for password encryption. To reduce the risk of a
   vulnerability or misconfiguration allowing privilege escalation, some
   programs have been written or adapted to make use of privilege
   separation, privilege revocation and chrooting. Privilege separation is
   a technique, pioneered on OpenBSD and inspired by the principle of
   least privilege, where a program is split into two or more parts, one
   of which performs privileged operations and the otherâ€”almost always the
   bulk of the codeâ€”runs without privilege. Privilege revocation is
   similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with
   the privileges it starts with then dropping them, and chrooting
   involves restricting an application to one section of the file system,
   prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or system
   files. Developers have applied these features to OpenBSD versions of
   common applications, including tcpdump and the Apache web server,
   which, due to licensing issues with the later Apache 2 series, is a
   heavily patched 1.3 release.

   The project has a policy of continually auditing code for security
   problems, work developer Marc Espie has described as "never finished â€¦
   more a question of process than of a specific bug being hunted." He
   went on to list several typical steps once a bug is found, including
   examining the entire source tree for the same and similar issues,
   "try[ing] to find out whether the documentation ought to be amended,"
   and investigating whether "it's possible to augment the compiler to
   warn against this specific problem." Along with DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD
   is one of the two open source operating systems with a policy of
   seeking out examples of classic, K&R C code and converting it to the
   more modern ANSI equivalentâ€”this involves no functional change and is
   purely for readability and consistency reasons. A standard code style,
   the Kernel Normal Form, which dictates how code must look in order to
   be easily maintained and understood, must be applied to all code before
   it is considered for inclusion in the base operating system; existing
   code is actively updated to meet the style requirements.

Uses

   OpenBSD's security enhancements, built-in cryptography and the PF
   firewall suit it for use in the security industry, particularly for
   firewalls, intrusion-detection systems and VPN gateways. It is also
   commonly used for servers which need to be resistant against cracking
   attempts and DoS attacks, and due to the inclusion of the spamd daemon,
   it occasionally sees use in mail filtering applications.

   There are several proprietary systems which are based on OpenBSD,
   including Profense from Armorlogic ApS, various security appliances
   made by .vantronix GmbH, syswall from Syscall Network Solutions AG,
   GeNUGate and GeNUBox from GeNUA mbH, HIOBMessenger from topX and RTMX
   O/S from RTMX Inc. Of these, both RTMX and GeNUA have contributed back
   to OpenBSD: RTMX have sent patches to add further POSIX compliance to
   the system and GeNUA funded the development of SMP on the i386
   platform. Several open source operating systems have also been derived
   from OpenBSD, notably Anonym.OS and MirOS BSD, as well as the now
   defunct ekkoBSD, MicroBSD and Gentoo/OpenBSD. In addition, code from
   many of the OpenBSD system tools has been used in recent versions of
   Microsoft's Services for UNIX, an extension to the Windows operating
   system which provides some Unix-like functionality, originally based on
   4.4BSD-Lite. Core force, a security product for Windows, is based on
   OpenBSD's PF firewall. There have also been projects which use OpenBSD
   as part of images for embedded systems, including OpenSoekris and
   flashdist; together with tools like nsh, these allow Cisco-like
   embedded devices to be created.

   OpenBSD ships with the X window system. Following the XFree86 licence
   change, it includes a recent X.Org release; an older XFree86 3.3
   release is also available for legacy video cards. With these, it is
   possible to use OpenBSD as a desktop or workstation, making use of a
   desktop environment, window manager or both to give the X desktop a
   wide range of appearances. The OpenBSD ports tree contains many of the
   most popular tools for desktop use, including desktop environments
   GNOME, KDE, and Xfce; web browsers Mozilla Firefox and Opera; and
   multimedia programs. In addition, graphical software for many uses is
   available from both the ports tree and by compiling POSIX compliant
   software. Also available are compatibility layers, which allow binary
   code compiled for other operating systems, including Linux, FreeBSD,
   SunOS and HP-UX, to be run. However, since hardware providers such as
   graphics card manufacturers ATI and NVIDIA refuse to release open
   source drivers or documentation for the 3D capabilities of their
   hardware, OpenBSD lacks accelerated 3D graphics support.

   OpenBSD's performance and usability is occasionally criticized.
   Performance and scalability tests, most famously Felix von Leitner's
   tests, often show OpenBSD to lag behind other operating systems.
   OpenBSD users and developers have countered this by asserting that
   although performance is certainly given consideration, security,
   reliability and correctness are seen as more important. OpenBSD is also
   a relatively small project, particularly when compared with FreeBSD and
   Linux, and developer time is sometimes seen as better spent on security
   enhancements than performance optimisations. Critics of usability often
   point out the lack of user-friendly configuration tools, the bare
   default installation, and "spartan" and "intimidating" installer. These
   see much the same rebuttals as performance: a preference for
   simplicity, reliability and security; as one reviewer admits, "running
   an ultra-secure operating system can be a bit of work."

Distribution and marketing

   OpenBSD is available freely in various ways: the source can be
   retrieved by anonymous CVS or CVSup, and binary releases and
   development snapshots can be downloaded either by FTP or HTTP.
   Prepackaged CD sets can be ordered online for a small fee, complete
   with an assortment of stickers and a copy of the release's theme song.
   These, with their artwork and other bonuses, are one of the project's
   few sources of income, funding hardware, bandwidth and other expenses.
   To encourage the sale of the official CDs, OpenBSD makes only a small
   install ISO image available for download rather than provide full
   release ISOs.

   In common with several other operating systems, OpenBSD uses ports and
   packages systems to allow for easy installation and management of
   programs which are not part of the base operating system. Originally
   based on the FreeBSD ports tree, the system is now quite distinct.
   Additionally, major changes have been made since the 3.6 release,
   including the replacement of the package tools, the tools available to
   the user to manipulate packages, by more capable versions, written in
   Perl by Marc Espie. In contrast to FreeBSD, the OpenBSD ports system is
   intended as a source used to create the end product, the packages:
   installing a port first creates a package and then installs it using
   the package tools. Packages are built in bulk by the OpenBSD team and
   provided for download with each release. OpenBSD is also unique among
   the BSDs in that the ports and base operating system are developed and
   released together for each version: this means that the ports or
   packages released with, for example, 3.7 are not suitable for use with
   3.6 and vice versa, a policy which lends a great deal of stability to
   the development process, but means that the software in ports for the
   latest OpenBSD release can lag somewhat from the latest version
   available from the author.

   Around the time of the OpenBSD 2.7 release, the original mascot, a BSD
   daemon with a trident and aureola, was replaced by Puffy, traditionally
   said to be a pufferfish. In fact pufferfish do not possess spikes and
   images of Puffy are closer to a similar species, the porcupinefish.
   Puffy was selected because of the Blowfish encryption algorithm used in
   OpenSSH and the strongly defensive image of the porcupinefish with its
   spikes to deter predators. He quickly became very popular, mainly
   because of the appealing image of the fish and his distinction from the
   BSD daemon, also used by FreeBSD, and the horde of daemons then used by
   NetBSD. Puffy made his first public appearance in OpenBSD 2.6 and,
   since then, has appeared in a number of guises on tee-shirts and
   posters. These have included Puffiana Jones, the famed hackologist and
   adventurer, seeking out the Lost RAID; Puffathy, a little Alberta girl,
   who must work with Taiwan to save the day; Sir Puffy of Ramsay, a
   freedom fighter who, with Little Bob of Beckley, took from the rich and
   gave to all; and Puff Daddy, famed rapper and political icon.

   After a number of releases, OpenBSD has become notorious for its catchy
   songs and interesting and often comical artwork. The promotional
   material of early OpenBSD releases did not have a cohesive theme or
   design but, starting with OpenBSD 3.0, the CDs, release songs, posters
   and tee-shirts for each release have been produced with a single style
   and theme, sometimes contributed to by Ty Semaka of the Plaid Tongued
   Devils. At first they were done lightly and only intended to add humour
   but, as the concept has evolved, they have become a part of OpenBSD
   advocacy, with each release expanding a moral or political point
   important to the project, often through parody. Past themes have
   included: in OpenBSD 3.8, the Hackers of the Lost RAID, a parody of
   Indiana Jones linked to the new RAID tools featured as part of the
   release; The Wizard of OS, making its debut in OpenBSD 3.7, based on
   the work of Pink Floyd and a parody of The Wizard of Oz related to the
   project's recent wireless hacking; and OpenBSD 3.3's Puff the
   Barbarian, including an 80s rock-style song and parody of Conan the
   Barbarian, alluding to open documentation.

   In addition to the slogans used on tee-shirts and posters for releases,
   the project occasionally produces other material: over the years,
   catchphrases have included "Sending script kiddies to /dev/null since
   1995," "Functional, secure, free â€“ choose 3," "Secure by default," and
   a few insider slogans, only available on tee-shirts made for developer
   gatherings, such as "World class security for much less than the price
   of a cruise missile" and a crufty old octopus proclaiming "Shut up and
   hack!"
