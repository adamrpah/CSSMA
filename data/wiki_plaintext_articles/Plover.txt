   Plovers are a widely distributed group of wading birds belonging to the
   subfamily Charadriinae. There are about 40 species in the subfamily,
   most of them called "plover" or "dotterel". The closely related lapwing
   subfamily, Vanellinae, comprises another 20-odd species.

   Plovers are found throughout the world, and are characterised by
   relatively short bills. They hunt by sight, rather than by feel as
   longer-billed waders like snipe do.

   They feed mainly on insects, worms or other invertebrates, depending on
   habitat, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than
   the steady probing of some other wader groups.
