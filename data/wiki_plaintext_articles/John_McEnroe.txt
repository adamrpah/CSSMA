   John Patrick McEnroe, Jr. (born February 16, 1959 in Wiesbaden,
   Germany) is a former World No. 1 professional tennis player from the
   United States. Scott Riley, writing for The Sports Network, recognized
   him as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. During his
   career, he won seven Grand Slam singles titles – three at Wimbledon and
   four at the U.S. Open. He also won nine Grand Slam men's doubles titles
   and one Grand Slam mixed doubles title. He is remembered for his
   shot-making artistry and supreme volleying; for his matches against
   Björn Borg; for his fiery on-court temperament, which frequently landed
   him in trouble with umpires and tennis authorities; and for the
   catchphrase "You cannot be serious!" directed toward an umpire during a
   match at Wimbledon in 1981. He was inducted into the International
   Tennis Hall of Fame in 1999.

   After a 12-year absence from the professional tour, McEnroe returned to
   top-level doubles competition in 2006 and became the oldest male player
   to win a top-level title in 30 years at San Jose.

Playing style

   McEnroe's game combined shot-making artistry, deft volleys, and a fast,
   attacking style of play. His sharp reflexes enabled him to return the
   biggest serves and passing shots masterfully, and the variety,
   delicacy, and quickness of his play delighted crowds. But McEnroe also
   quickly became known for his competitive fire and volatile temper.
   Verbal outbursts seemed to be a key way in which he motivated himself
   to battle through tough situations during matches, but this frequently
   got him into trouble.

Early success

   McEnroe was born in the U.S military base at Wiesbaden, where his
   father was stationed with the United States Air Force. He is of Irish
   descent. When he was less than a year old, his family moved to New York
   City. He grew up in Douglaston, Queens and learned tennis at the nearby
   Port Washington Tennis Academy, in Port Washington, on Long Island, NY.

   McEnroe took the tennis world by storm as an 18-year-old in 1977, when
   he made it through the qualifying tournament into the main draw at
   Wimbledon, where he lost in four sets to Jimmy Connors in the
   semifinals. It was the best performance by a qualifier at a Grand Slam
   tournament and a record performance for an amateur in the open era.

   Shortly after, McEnroe entered Stanford University and won the NCAA
   singles and team titles in 1978. After that, he joined the professional
   tour.

   McEnroe signed one of the first professional endorsement deals in
   tennis with Sergio Tacchini in 1978.

   McEnroe won his first Grand Slam singles title at the 1979 US Open. He
   defeated his good friend Vitas Gerulaitis in straight sets in the final
   to become the youngest winner of the championships since Pancho
   Gonzales, who was also 20, in 1948. (Pete Sampras eventually became the
   youngest US Open Champion at 19 years old.) McEnroe won 10 singles and
   17 doubles titles that year (for a total of 27 titles, which marked an
   open-era record).

Famous battles with Björn Borg (1980-81)

   In 1980, McEnroe reached the men's singles final at Wimbledon for the
   first time, where he faced Björn Borg, who was gunning for his fifth
   consecutive Wimbledon title. At the start of the final, McEnroe was
   booed by the crowd as he entered Centre Court following heated
   exchanges with officials during his semifinal victory over Jimmy
   Connors. But the match itself was arguably the greatest Wimbledon final
   ever. In a long fourth-set tiebreaker that is often simply called "that
   tie-breaker," which lasted 20 minutes, McEnroe saved five match points
   and eventually won it 18-16. McEnroe, however, could not break Borg's
   serve in the fifth set, which the Swede won 8-6. This match was ranked
   as the best final in Wimbledon history by ESPN on their countdown show
   "Who's Number One?" ESPN Personality Mike Greenberg called the match
   "one of the three or four greatest sporting events in history."

   Revenge for McEnroe came quickly. The pair met again in the final of
   the 1980 US Open two months later, and this time it was McEnroe who
   emerged the victor in another five set encounter.

   Controversy dogged McEnroe from the start when he returned to Wimbledon
   in 1981. Following his second round match against Tom Gullikson,
   McEnroe was fined U.S. $1,500 and came close to being thrown out of the
   championships as a result of an infamous blow-up in which he called
   umpire Ted James "the pits of the world" and then swore at tournament
   referee Fred Hoyles. The phrase "you cannot be serious," which years
   later would become the title of McEnroe's autobiography, was also made
   famous during the 1981 Wimbledon campaign as a retort McEnroe
   frequently made in response to umpires' calls during his matches. This
   behaviour was in sharp contrast to that of Borg, who was painted by the
   tabloid press as an unflappable "ice man."

   But despite the controversy and merciless criticism from the British
   press (who nicknamed him "SuperBrat"), McEnroe again made the Wimbledon
   men's singles final against Borg. And this time, McEnroe defeated Borg
   in four sets to end the Swede's run of 41 consecutive match victories
   at the All England Club.

   The controversy, however, did not end there. In response to McEnroe's
   on-court outbursts during the championships, the All England Club did
   not accord McEnroe honorary club membership, an honour normally given
   to first time singles champions immediately after their victory.
   McEnroe responded by not attending the traditional champions dinner
   that evening. He told the press: "I wanted to spend (the evening) with
   my family and friends and the people who had supported me, not a bunch
   of stiffs who are 70-80 years old, telling you that you're acting like
   a jerk." The honour was eventually accorded to McEnroe after he won the
   championship again.

   Borg and McEnroe had their final confrontation in the final of the 1981
   US Open. McEnroe won in four sets, becoming the first male player since
   the 1920s to win three consecutive U.S. Open singles titles. Borg never
   played another Grand Slam event.

Continued success (1982-85)

   McEnroe lost to Jimmy Connors in the 1982 Wimbledon final. McEnroe had
   not lost a set going into the final; however, Connors won the fourth
   set tiebreak and the fifth set to win the championship.

   In 1983, McEnroe reached his fourth consecutive Wimbledon final and
   swept aside the unheralded New Zealander Chris Lewis in straight-sets.
   He also played at the Australian Open for the first time, making it to
   the semifinals before being defeated in four sets by Mats Wilander.

   At the 1984 French Open, McEnroe lost a close final match to Ivan
   Lendl. McEnroe was on the verge of beating Lendl after winning the
   first two sets. But fatigue and temperamental outbursts got the better
   of McEnroe, allowing Lendl to win a dramatic five-setter. The loss
   ended a 39-match winning streak and was the closest McEnroe ever came
   to winning the French Open.

   In the 1984 Wimbledon final, McEnroe played a virtually flawless match
   to defeat Connors in just 80 minutes, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2. That was McEnroe's
   third and final Wimbledon singles title.

   McEnroe won his fourth U.S. Open title in 1984 by defeating Lendl in
   straight sets in the final.

   1984 was arguably McEnroe's best year on the tennis tour, as he
   compiled an 82-3 record and won a career-high 13 singles tournaments,
   including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. He also was on the U.S.' winning
   World Team Cup and runner-up Davis Cup teams. The only male who has
   come close to matching McEnroe's 1984 win-loss record since then was
   Roger Federer in 2005. Federer was 81-3 before losing his last match of
   the year to David Nalbandian.

   McEnroe's 1984 season did not end without controversy. While playing
   and winning the tournament in Stockholm, McEnroe had an on-court
   outburst that became notorious in sports highlight reels. After
   questioning a call made by the chair umpire, McEnroe demanded, "Answer
   my question, jerk!" McEnroe then slammed his racquet into a juice cart
   beside the court.

   In 1985, McEnroe reached his last Grand Slam singles final at the U.S.
   Open. This time, he was beaten in straight sets by Lendl.

Taking time out

   By 1986, the pressures of playing at the top had become too much for
   McEnroe to handle and he took a six-month break from the tour. It was
   during this sabbatical that he married the actress Tatum O'Neal with
   whom he would eventually have 3 children (Kevin, Sean, and Emily). When
   he returned to the tour later in the year, he won three titles. However
   McEnroe never seemed to be able to recapture his very best form again.
   In 1987, McEnroe failed to win a title for the first time since turning
   pro. He took a seven-month break from the game following the US Open,
   where he was suspended for two months and fined US$17,500 for
   misconduct and verbal abuse.

Association of Tennis Professionals World No. 1 ranking

   According to the ranking system maintained by the Association of Tennis
   Professionals, McEnroe first became the top ranked singles player in
   March 1980. He was the top ranked player on 14 separate occasions
   between 1980 and 1985 and finished the year ranked World No. 1 four
   straight years from 1981 through 1984. He spent a total of 170 weeks at
   the top of the rankings.

Success in doubles

   McEnroe was also ranked the World No. 1 in doubles for a record 257
   weeks. He formed a powerful partnership with Peter Fleming, with whom
   he won 57 men's doubles titles including four at Wimbledon and three at
   the US Open. (Fleming was always very modest about his own contribution
   to the partnership—he once said "the best doubles partnership in the
   world is John McEnroe and anybody else.") McEnroe won a fourth US Open
   men's doubles title in 1989 with Mark Woodforde, and a fifth Wimbledon
   men's doubles title in 1992 with Michael Stich. He also won the 1977
   French Open mixed doubles title with childhood pal Mary Carillo.

Representing his country

   More than any other player in his era, McEnroe was responsible for
   reviving U.S. interest in the Davis Cup, which had been shunned by
   Jimmy Connors and other leading U.S. players. In 1978, McEnroe won two
   singles rubbers in the final as the U.S. captured the cup for the first
   time since 1972, beating the United Kingdom in the final. McEnroe
   continued to be a mainstay of U.S. Davis Cup teams for the next 14
   years and was part of U.S. winning teams in 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1992.
   He set numerous U.S. Davis Cup records, including years played (12),
   ties (30), singles wins (41), and total wins in singles and doubles
   (59). He played both singles and doubles in 13 series, and he and Peter
   Fleming won 14 of 15 Davis Cup doubles matches together.

   An epic performance was McEnroe's 6-hour, 22-minute victory over Mats
   Wilander in the deciding rubber of the 3-2 quarterfinal win over Sweden
   in 1982, played in St. Louis, Missouri. McEnroe won the match, at the
   time the longest in Davis Cup history, 9-7, 6-2, 15-17, 3-6, 8-6.

   McEnroe nearly broke that record in a 6-hour, 20-minute loss to Boris
   Becker five years later. Becker won their match, the second rubber in a
   3-2 loss to West Germany in World Group Relegation play, 4-6, 15-13,
   8-10, 6-2, 6-2.

   McEnroe also helped the U.S. win the World Team Cup in 1984 and 1985.

Final years on the tour

   McEnroe struggled to regain his form after his 1986 sabbatical. He
   lost, for example, three times in Grand Slam tournaments to Ivan Lendl,
   losing straight-set quarterfinals at both the 1987 U.S. Open and the
   1989 Australian Open and a long four-set match, played over two days,
   in the fourth round of the 1988 French Open.

   Nevertheless McEnroe had several notable victories in the final years
   of his career.

   In 1989, McEnroe won a record fifth title at the World Championship
   Tennis Finals (the championship tournament of the WCT tour, which was
   being staged for the last time), defeating top-ranked Lendl in the
   semifinals. At Wimbledon, he defeated Mats Wilander in a four-set
   quarterfinal before losing to Stefan Edberg in a semifinal. He won the
   RCA Championships in Indianapolis and reached the final of the Canadian
   Open, where he lost to Lendl. He also won both of his singles rubbers
   in the quarterfinal Davis Cup tie with Sweden.

   Controversy was never far from McEnroe, however. In his fourth round
   match against Mikael Pernfors at the 1990 Australian Open, McEnroe was
   disqualified for swearing at the umpire, supervisor, and referee. He
   was warned by the umpire for intimidating a lineswoman and then docked
   a point for smashing a racket. McEnroe was apparently unaware that a
   new Code of Conduct, which had been introduced just before the
   tournament, meant that a third code violation would not lead to the
   deduction of a game but instead would result in immediate
   disqualification. So when McEnroe unleashed a volley of abuse at umpire
   Gerry Armstrong, he was defaulted.

   Later that year, McEnroe reached the semifinals of the U.S. Open,
   losing to the eventual champion, Pete Sampras. He also won the Davidoff
   Swiss Indoors in Basel, defeating Goran Ivanišević in a five-set final.
   The last time McEnroe was ranked in the world top ten was on October
   22, 1990, when he was ranked 9th. His end-of-year singles ranking was
   13th.

   In 1991, McEnroe won the last edition of the Volvo Tennis-Chicago
   tournament by defeating his brother Patrick in the final. He won both
   of his singles rubbers in the quarterfinal Davis Cup tie with Spain.
   And he reached the fourth round at Wimbledon (losing to Edberg) and the
   third round at the U.S. Open (losing to Michael Chang in a five-set
   night match). His end-of-year singles ranking was 28th in the world.

   In 1992, McEnroe defeated third-ranked Boris Becker in the third round
   of the Australian Open 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 before a sell-out crowd. In the
   fourth round, McEnroe needed 4 hours 42 minutes to defeat ninth ranked
   Emilio Sanchez 8-6 in the fifth set. He lost to Wayne Ferreira in the
   quarterfinals. At Wimbledon, McEnroe reached the semifinals where he
   lost in straight sets to the eventual champion Andre Agassi. McEnroe
   teamed with Michael Stich to win his fifth Wimbledon men’s doubles
   title in a record-length 5 hour 1 minute final, which the pair won 5-7,
   7-6, 3-6, 7-6, 19-17. At the end of the year, he teamed with Sampras to
   win the doubles rubber in the Davis Cup final, where the U.S. defeated
   Switzerland 3-1.

   McEnroe retired from the professional tour at the end of 1992. He ended
   his singles career ranked 20th in the world.

Career statistics

   McEnroe won a total of 155 top-level titles (a record for a male
   professional) during his career — 84 in singles (including 76 listed on
   the website maintained by the Association of Tennis Professionals
   (ATP)), 70 in men's doubles, and 1 in mixed doubles. His career singles
   match record was 864-194 (82%). He won seven Grand Slam singles titles
   and the season-ending Masters championships three times ( 1978, 1983,
   and 1984). He won the World Championship Tennis (WCT) Finals, the
   championship tournament of the WCT tour, a record five times ( 1979,
   1981, 1983, 1984, and 1989).

   According to the ATP website, McEnroe had the edge in career matches on
   Jimmy Connors (20-14), Stefan Edberg (7-6), Mats Wilander (7-6),
   Michael Chang (4-1), Ilie Nastase (4-2), and Pat Cash (3-1). McEnroe
   was even with Björn Borg (7-7), Andre Agassi (2-2), and Michael Stich
   (1-1). He trailed against Pete Sampras (0-3), Goran Ivanišević (2-4),
   Boris Becker (2-8), Guillermo Vilas (5-6), Jim Courier (1-2), and Ivan
   Lendl (15-21). McEnroe won 12 of the last 14 matches with Connors,
   beginning with the 1983 Cincinnati tournament. Edberg won the last 5
   matches with McEnroe, beginning with the 1989 tournament in Tokyo.
   McEnroe won 4 of the last 5 matches with Vilas, beginning with the 1981
   tournament in Boca Raton, Florida. And Lendl won 11 of the last 12
   matches with McEnroe, beginning with the 1985 U.S. Open.

   McEnroe, however, played in numerous events, including invitational
   tournaments, that are not covered by the ATP website. McEnroe won eight
   of those events and had wins and losses against the players listed in
   the preceding paragraph that are not reflected on the ATP website.

After retirement from the tour

   McEnroe divorced Tatum O'Neal in 1992 and married musician Patty Smyth
   in 1997. He has six children (three with O'Neal, two with Smyth, and
   one from Smyth's previous marriage to rock star Richard Hell). While he
   was originally awarded full custody of their children, they now have
   joint custody.

   McEnroe was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in
   1999.

   McEnroe became the U.S. Davis Cup captain in September 1999. His team
   barely escaped defeat in their first two outings in 2000, beating
   Zimbabwe and the Czech Republic in tight 3-2 encounters. They were then
   defeated 5-0 by Spain in the semifinals. McEnroe resigned in November
   2000 after 14 months as captain, citing frustration with the Davis Cup
   schedule and format as two of his primary reasons. His brother Patrick
   McEnroe took over the job.

   Never at a loss for words, in 2002 McEnroe wrote a book (along with
   co-author James Kaplan) entitled You Cannot Be Serious, an
   autobiographical account of his life during and after tennis. It was
   published as Serious: The Autobiography in the United Kingdom and
   Ireland. In the book, McEnroe shared many stories about the realities
   of the tennis tour, the role of corporations in professional tennis,
   and his off-court, drug-induced escapades.

   In July 2004, McEnroe began a CNBC talk show entitled " McEnroe." The
   show, however, was unsuccessful, twice earning a 0.0 Nielsen rating,
   and was cancelled within five months. He also hosted The Chair quiz
   show in both the U.K. and the U.S., but this venture also was
   unsuccessful. McEnroe played himself in the 2004 movie Wimbledon.

   McEnroe is active in philanthropy and tennis development. McEnroe
   currently owns an art gallery in Manhattan.

   McEnroe now fills his time by playing on two senior tours, the Merrill
   Lynch Tour of Champions and the Outback Champions Series, and by being
   a TV commentator at major tournaments. Many players and tennis experts
   agree that McEnroe's level of play is still high enough for him to
   compete on the professional level. In charity events and World Team
   Tennis, he has beaten many top players, including Mardy Fish and Mark
   Philippoussis. He defeated Andy Roddick in a doubles charity match, and
   was even able to volley back some of Roddick's powerful shots.

   In 2007, McEnroe appeared on the the NBC comedy 30 Rock as the host of
   a game show called "Gold Case" in which he uttered his famous line "You
   cannot be serious !" when a taping went awry.

Return to the tour

   McEnroe returned to the ATP Tour in 2006 to play two doubles
   tournaments.

   In his first tournament, he teamed with Jonas Björkman to win the title
   at the SAP Open in San Jose, which was McEnroe's first title since
   capturing the Paris Indoor doubles title in November 1992 with his
   brother Patrick. At age 47 years and 3 days, he was the oldest player
   to win a top-level title, either in singles or doubles, in thirty
   years. The win meant that McEnroe had won doubles titles in four
   different decades and is tied with Tom Okker for the second highest
   number (78) of doubles titles in history (trailing Todd Woodbridge).

   In his second tournament, McEnroe and Bjorkman lost in the
   quarterfinals of the tournament in Stockholm.

Quotes

   When asked to name the top 5 greatest tennis players of all time, Mats
   Wilander put Roger Federer, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, and Björn Borg
   in the top 4 with Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, and McEnroe tying at 5th.
   On McEnroe he said: "He had the maximum potential among everyone I’m
   talking about, but couldn’t fulfill it. I’m sure he must have kicked
   himself quite a few times for not developing into the greatest of all
   time. He believed in improving by playing matches, that’s why he played
   a lot of doubles along with singles, but he ignored practice. Had he
   worked on his game and fitness like normal top pros, sky was the
   limit."

Pop-culture appearances

   McEnroe's fiery temper has got him featured in fields other than tennis
   on more than one occasion. In 1982, on the tail of his final victory
   against Borg, British impressionist Roger Kitter made a record called
   Chalk Dust: The Umpire Strikes Back in which he played a parody of
   McEnroe losing his temper with an umpire during a match. The record was
   made under the nomenclature "The Brat" and reached the UK Top 20; by
   this time the British tabloids had dubbed him "SuperBrat". He is also
   sampled and referenced on Dionysos' album Western Sous La Neige which
   features multiple tracks that talk about writing in the blood of bad
   referees. His random bursts of rage were also parodied in the satirical
   British programme ' Spitting Image', where he and wife Tatum frequently
   screamed and threw things at each other.

   In the House of Pain's 1992 hit single "Jump Around," lead rapper
   Everlast mentions John McEnroe in the second verse: I'll serve your ass
   like John McEnroe, if your girl steps up I'm smackin' the ho.

   In the 2003 Halloween cartoon for Homestar Runner, 3 Times Halloween
   Funjob, Homestar dresses as John McEnroe. An Easter egg at the end of
   the cartoon shows a puppet version of Homestar doing an impresson of
   one of McEnroe's infamous displays of bad temper.

   McEnroe has also been given roles in TV and film where he playfully
   acknowledges his well-known belligerence such as in his appearance in a
   2005 car commercial for the SEAT Altea where he angrily shouts his
   trademark "Clearly inside the line" line at an officer who has ticketed
   him for parking incorrectly. He also portrays himself in the 2002 film
   Mr. Deeds where he lauds the title character for getting angry and
   assaulting an antagonist, and has a scene in the film Anger Management
   starring Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler, most of which was cut-
   leaving only a short shot of him sleeping on the floor of the
   psychiatrist's office. The full scene is in the DVD special features.

   McEnroe also has appeared in Nike's recent tennis commercials with his
   brother Patrick and tennis star Maria Sharapova. He appeared in another
   commercial where he taught Pete Sampras how to throw temper tantrums on
   the court.

   McEnroe appeared on the December 16, 2006, episode of the UK talk show
   Parkinson.

   McEnroe is also a guitar player.
