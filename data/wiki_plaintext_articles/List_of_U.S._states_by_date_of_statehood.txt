   The order which the original 13 states ratified the constitution, then
   the order that the others were admitted to the union

   This is a list of U.S. states by date of statehood, that is, the date
   when each U.S. state joined the Union. Although the first 13 states can
   be considered to be members of the United States from the date of the
   Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776, they are presented here as
   being "admitted" on the date each ratified the present United States
   Constitution; most other such lists, including the 50 State Quarters
   program, do the same. The admission dates for later states were set by
   either the act of admission or a later resolution issued under that
   act, except for Ohio whose date of admission was determined by act of
   Congress in 1953 (see note below).

   The dates on this list do not account for the ostensible secession
   during the American Civil War of several states to form the Confederate
   States of America, the subsequent restoration of those states to
   representation in Congress (sometimes called "readmission") between
   1866 and 1870, or the end of Reconstruction in those states. Nor do the
   dates on the list reflect ratification of the Articles of
   Confederation, which is the original document naming the United States
   as such, and giving the initial label of "states" to the subnational
   political entities.
