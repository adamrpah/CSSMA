   Tropical Storm Matthew was a weak tropical storm in the 2004 Atlantic
   hurricane season that made landfall on Louisiana. Matthew was the
   thirteenth tropical storm of the season and the ninth storm to affect
   the United States.

   Matthew formed over the western Gulf of Mexico on October 8 and struck
   south-central Louisiana 2 days later. The storm brought heavy rains to
   much of the Gulf Coast, the most being over 15 inches (381 mm) in parts
   of Louisiana. Damage was minimal, totaling $305,000 (2004 USD), and no
   casualties were reported.

Storm History

   Storm path

   A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 19. The wave
   moved westward, but was difficult to track due to its proximity to
   Hurricane Lisa and another large tropical wave. It passed through the
   Lesser Antilles, and slowly organized as convection increased due to an
   upper level low. On October 5, it entered the Gulf of Mexico, and
   developed an area of low pressure two days later. The system continued
   to organize, and on October 8, after developing a circulation, it
   developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen while located 205 miles
   (330 km) to the southeast of Brownsville, Texas.

   The depression moved to the east-northeast, and quickly strengthened
   into Tropical Storm Matthew. Operationally, Matthew fluctuated between
   tropical depression and tropical storm status, but in post-season
   analysis, the storm remained a tropical storm. The storm turned to the
   northeast while moving around the periphery of a high pressure system
   over Texas, and attained a peak intensity of 45 mph (70 km/h) on
   October 9. Strong wind shear limited further strengthening, and on the
   10th, Matthew struck Cocodrie, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm.
   It quickly weakened, and became an extratropical depression, and merged
   with an approaching frontal boundary shortly thereafter.

   After it merged with the system, the storm moved inland over Arkansas,
   Tennessee and the Ohio Valley. While moving inland, Matthew spun off
   another low pressure system that formed over North Carolina on October
   13. The low moved off the Mid-Atlantic coast before hitting
   Massachusetts two days later, and later merged with the original low
   pressure system of Matthew.

Preparations

   Initially, forecasters at the National Hurricane Centre predicted that
   Matthew would take a more eastern track and hit the Florida Panhandle.
   Because the track shifted westward, the National Hurricane Centre
   issued a Tropical Storm Warning from the Florida/ Alabama border to
   Intracoastal City, Louisiana on the day before landfall.

   Rainfall totals from Matthew

   Though damage was minor throughout its path, Matthew dropped moderate
   to heavy rainfall across much of the Gulf Coast, peaking at over 15
   inches (381 mm) in portions of Louisiana.

Louisiana

   Upon making landfall, Matthew caused a storm surge of up to 5.85 feet
   (1.8 m) in Frenier, Louisiana. The storm surge and waves resulted in
   significant beach erosion in Grand Isle. Matthew produced heavy
   rainfall across its path, totaling to 16.23 inches (410 mm) in Reserve
   in the southeastern portion of the state. Portions of northwestern
   Louisiana experienced significant rainfall, including a peak of 18
   inches (460 mm) in Haynesville near the Louisiana/ Arkansas border. In
   addition, Matthew spawned one tornado, causing damage to the roof of a
   trailer in Golden Meadow. The rainfall also caused rivers to crest
   higher than normal, including the Killian River which peaked at 5.7
   feet (1.7 m).

   Rainfall and storm surge flooded 20 homes in Terrebonne Parish. In
   addition, several homes in Lafouche Parish experienced flooding,
   including two with over two feet of water. Numerous homes in Golden
   Meadow experienced flooding, as well. The flooding also forced the
   temporary closing of numerous roads across the state , including
   portions of U.S. Route 11 and Interstate 10. Flood waters from the
   storm cracked a water line in LaPlace, leaving nearly 30,000 residents
   and m any businesses without tap water. The problem was expected to
   take little time to fix, though residents were advise to boil the water
   before drinking it. Matthew also left 2,500 people without power for a
   short period of time. The storm's impact also closed several schools,
   forcing school administrators to reschedule plans for making up school
   closings caused by Hurricane Ivan one month earlier. In all, Matthew
   caused no deaths and $255,000 in damage (2004 USD).

Elsewhere

   As the storm made landfall, the outer-bands of Matthew brought heavy
   rains in Florida. The rain was reported as far south as Naples. In
   Pensacola, 30 mph (48 km/h) gusts were reported, as well rainfall
   totaling up to 3 to 4 inches (75 to 100 mm). In Alabama, wind gusts
   peaked at 47 mph (75 km/h) at Dauphin Island. The storm produced light
   rainfall across the state, totaling to 2.74 inches (70 mm) at Grand
   Bay. In addition, Matthew produced tides of 1 to 3 feet (.3 to .9 m)
   above normal, causing minor to major beach erosion. The beach erosion,
   which typically would have been minor for a weak storm, was greater
   than expected due to the passage of Hurricane Ivan just weeks before.
   No major damage was reported in Alabama. In Mississippi, winds gusts
   peaked at 45 mph (72 km/h) with sustained winds of 39 mph (63 km/h) in
   Waveland. Storm surge ranged from 2 to 4 feet (.6 to 1.2 m) along much
   of the coastline, though Waveland reported a peak of 5.13 feet (1.56
   m). Rainfall totals were mainly between 2 to 4 inches (50 to 100 mm).
   Damage in Mississippi totaled to $50,000 (2004 USD).

   Matthew produced moderate rainfall on its west side, as well. Portions
   of Texas and Oklahoma experienced over 5 inches (127 mm) of rain, while
   southern Arkansas received over 10 inches (255 mm) of rainfall. The
   rainfall was well-received due to a period of dry weather in the area.
   Though it slowed harvest activities, it aided pastures.

Naming

   This was the first time a tropical storm was named Matthew. Matthew is
   the replacement name set in spring of 1999 in place of Hurricane Mitch.

   Because the damage was minimal, the name was not retired by the World
   Meteorological Organization and will be on the list of names for the
   2010 season.
