   The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family
   Hirundinidae which are characterised by their adaptation to aerial
   feeding. Swallow is also used in Europe as a synonym for the Barn
   Swallow.

   This family comprises two subfamilies: Pseudochelidoninae (the river
   martins of the genus Pseudochelidon) and Hirundininae (all other
   swallows and martins). Within the Hirundiniae, the name martin tends to
   be used for the squarer-tailed species, and the name swallow for the
   more fork-tailed species; however, there is no scientific distinction
   between these two groups.

   They have adapted to hunting insects on the wing by developing a
   slender streamlined body, and long pointed wings. Like the unrelated
   swifts and nightjars, which hunt in a similar way, they have short
   bills, but a wide gape.

   Their feet are designed for perching rather than walking, and the front
   toes are partially joined at the base. Many species have long tails.

   Swallows typically build mud nests close to overhead shelter in
   locations that are protected from both the weather and predators.

   Many cave and cliff dwelling species of swallow nest in large colonies.
   In historical times, the introduction of man-made stone structures such
   as barns and bridges, together with forest clearance, has led to an
   abundance of colony sites around the globe, significantly increasing
   the breeding ranges of some species. Birds living in large colonies
   typically have to contend with both ectoparasites and conspecific nest
   parasitism. Old males benefit most from coloniality, since they are
   able to maintain their own nests and benefit from frequent extra-pair
   copulations.
