   1998 Atlantic hurricane season

   Hurricane Mitch was one of the deadliest and most powerful hurricanes
   observed on record, with maximum sustained winds of 180  mph (290
   km/h). The storm was the thirteenth tropical storm, ninth hurricane,
   and third major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. At the
   time, Mitch was the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever observed in the
   month of October, though it has since been surpassed by Hurricane Wilma
   of the 2005 season. The hurricane also tied for the fourth most intense
   Atlantic hurricane in recorded history, but it has since dropped to
   seventh.

   Mitch formed in the western Caribbean Sea on October 22, and after
   drifting through extremely favorable conditions, it rapidly
   strengthened to peak at Category 5 status, the highest possible rating
   on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After drifting southwestward and
   weakening, the hurricane hit Honduras as a minimal hurricane. It
   drifted through Central America, reformed in the Bay of Campeche, and
   ultimately struck Florida as a strong tropical storm.

   Due to its slow motion from October 29 to November 3, Hurricane Mitch
   dropped historic amounts of rainfall in Honduras and Nicaragua, with
   unofficial reports of up to 75 inches (1900 mm). Deaths due to
   catastrophic flooding made it the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane
   in history; nearly 11,000 people were killed with over 8,000 left
   missing by the end of 1998. The flooding caused extreme damage,
   estimated at over $5 billion (1998 USD, $6 billion 2005 USD).

Storm history

   Storm path

   Storm path

   The origin of Hurricane Mitch can be traced to a tropical wave that
   moved off the coast of Africa on October 10. It moved westward across
   the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean, and remained disorganized until
   entering the Caribbean Sea on October 18. Upon entering the western
   Caribbean Sea, convection steadily increased, and on October 22, the
   wave organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen while 415 miles
   (670 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica. Under weak steering currents, it
   drifted westward and intensified into a tropical storm on October 23
   while 260 miles (420 km) east-southeast of San Andrés Island.

   Initially, intensification was limited due to an upper-level low
   causing vertical wind shear over Tropical Storm Mitch. As the storm
   executed a small loop to the north, the shear weakened, allowing the
   system to strengthen. Mitch attained hurricane status on October 24
   while 295 miles (475 km) south of Jamaica, and with warm water
   temperatures and well-defined outflow, the hurricane rapidly
   strengthened. During a 24-hour period from October 24 to the 25th, the
   central pressure dropped 52 mbar, and on October 26, Mitch reached peak
   intensity with 180 mph (290 km/h) winds and a pressure of 905 mbar, one
   of the lowest pressures ever recorded in an Atlantic hurricane.

   A ridge of high pressure forced the hurricane westward, resulting in
   land interaction with Honduras. This weakened Mitch slightly, and after
   passing over the Swan Islands on October 27, the hurricane steadily
   weakened. The ridge of high pressure built further, forcing the
   hurricane to drift southward along the Honduran coastline. Mitch made
   landfall 80 miles (130 km) east of La Ceiba in Honduras on October 29
   as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale with 80
   mph (130 km/h) winds. It continued to weaken over land, drifting
   westward through Central America, and its low-level circulation
   dissipated on November 1 near the Guatemala-Mexico border.

   The remnant area of low pressure drifted northward into the Bay of
   Campeche, and reorganized on November 3 into a tropical storm while 150
   miles (240 km) southwest of Mérida, Yucatán. Mitch moved to the
   northeast, making landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula near Campeche on
   November 4. It weakened to a tropical depression over land, but
   restrengthened to a tropical storm over the southeastern Gulf of
   Mexico. As Mitch accelerated to the northeast in association with a
   cold front, it gradually intensified, and made landfall near Naples,
   Florida on November 5 as a tropical storm with 65 mph (100 km/h) winds.
   Mitch became extratropical later that day, but it continued to persist
   for several days before losing its identity north of Great Britain on
   November 9.

Preparations

   While stalling over the western Caribbean Sea, Mitch's future was very
   uncertain, with the National Hurricane Centre advising citizens
   throughout the area to closely monitor the hurricane. Just 2 days
   before landfall, there remained a possibility for the hurricane to
   spare Honduras and hit Guatemala or Belize. Because of the uncertainty,
   government officials issued hurricane warnings from the
   Honduras/Nicaragua border to Belize from 2-3 days before landfall.

   Due to the threat, the government of Honduras evacuated some of the
   45,000 citizens on the Bay Islands and prepared all air and naval
   resources. The government of Belize issued a red alert and asked for
   citizens on offshore islands to leave for the mainland. Because the
   hurricane threatened to strike near Belize City as a Category 4
   hurricane, much of the city was evacuated in fear of a repeat of
   Hurricane Hattie 37 years earlier. Guatemala issued a red alert as
   well, recommending boats to stay in port, telling people to prepare or
   seek shelter, and warning of potential overflown rivers. By the time
   Mitch made landfall, numerous people were evacuated along the western
   Caribbean coastline, including 100,000 in Honduras, 10,000 in
   Guatemala, and 20,000 in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.

   Hurricane Mitch was the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since the Great
   Hurricane of 1780, displacing the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 as the
   second-deadliest on record. Nearly eleven thousand people were
   confirmed dead, and almost as many reported missing. Deaths were mostly
   from flooding and mudslides in Central America, where the slow-moving
   hurricane and then tropical storm dropped nearly 3 feet (900  mm) of
   rain. The flooding and mudslides damaged or destroyed tens of thousands
   of homes, with total damage amounting to over $5 billion (1998 USD, $6
   billion 2005 USD), most of which was in Honduras and Nicaragua. Prior
   to Mitch, the deadliest hurricane in Central America was Hurricane Fifi
   in 1974, which killed an estimated 8,000–10,000.

Honduras

   Prior to hitting Honduras, Hurricane Mitch sent waves of up to 22 feet
   (6.7 m) in height to the coast. Upon making landfall, it diminished in
   intensity, but still caused a strong storm surge and waves of 12 feet
   (3.7 m) in height. While the storm was drifting over the country, it
   dropped extreme rainfall peaking at nearly 36 inches (91 cm) in
   Choluteca, where over 18 inches (46 cm) of rain fell in one day. The
   rainfall in Choluteca was equivalent to the average rainfall total in
   212 days. The Choluteca River at this point flooded to six times its
   normal width. The widespread flooding was partially caused by Honduras'
   slash and burn agriculture, so the forests could not absorb any
   moisture. In addition, there were estimates of as high as 75 inches
   (190 cm) in mountainous regions. The rainfall collected in rivers,
   causing extensive river flooding across the country. The deepest
   average depth was 12.5 meters on the Ulúa River near Chinda, while the
   average widest length was 359 meters on the Río Lean near Arizona. The
   rainfall also caused widespread mudslides across the mountainous
   country.

   Mitch caused such massive and widespread damage that Honduran President
   Carlos Roberto Flores claimed it destroyed fifty years of progress in
   the country. Mitch destroyed about 70% of the crops, totalling to about
   $900 million (1998 USD, $1 billion 2005 USD) in losses. An estimated
   70-80% of the transportation infrastructure of the entire country was
   wiped out, including nearly all bridges and secondary roads; the damage
   was so great that existing maps were rendered obsolete. About 25 small
   villages were reported to have been entirely destroyed by the
   landslides caused by the storm. Damages to the transportation and
   communication network totaled to $529 million (1998 USD, $671 million
   2005 USD). Across the country, the storm destroyed 33,000 houses and
   damaged 50,000 others. In addition, it downed numerous trees, leaving
   mountainsides bare and more vulnerable to mudslides.

   Mitch's rainfall resulted in severe crop losses in the country,
   affecting more than 300 sq. miles (800 km²) or 29% of the country's
   arable land. The flooding led to severe losses in food crops, including
   58% of the corn output, 24% of sorghum, 14% of rice, and 6% of the bean
   crop. Several important export crops faced similar losses, including
   85% of banana, 60% of sugar cane, 29% of melons, 28% of African palms,
   and 18% of coffee. Crop damage alone totaled to more than $1.7 billion
   (1998 USD, $1.97 billion 2005 USD). Large amounts of animal losses
   occurred as well, including the death of 50,000 bovines and the losses
   of 60% of the fowl population. Shrimp production, which had become an
   important export, faced nearly complete destruction. Total animal
   losses amounted to $300 million (1998 USD, $348 million 2005 USD).

   The extreme flooding and mudslides killed over 6,500, with several
   thousand missing. Many of the unidentified were buried in mass graves,
   resulting in great uncertainty over the final death toll. Over 20% of
   the country's population, possibly as many as 1.5 million people, were
   left homeless. The severe crop shortages left many villages on the
   brink of starvation, while lack of sanitation led to outbreaks of
   malaria, dengue fever, and cholera.

   On the offshore island of Guanaja, the hurricane spent three days
   stalling near the island. Strong winds destroyed one third of the
   island's houses and left most citizens without power for months. The
   island's two fish packing plants were damaged while two main resorts
   were closed. Guanaja, whose people rely on each other and the ocean,
   received little help from the Honduran government including some
   plastic tarps and soldiers. The government, which usually ignores the 9
   mile long (14 km) island, faced larger problems on the mainland.
   Instead, international aid arrived from former Guanaja citizens.

Nicaragua

   Though Mitch never entered Nicaragua, its large circulation caused
   extensive rainfall, with estimates of over 50 inches (127 cm). In some
   places, as much as 25 inches (64 cm) of rain fell on coastal areas. The
   crater lake in the Casita volcano overflowed from excessive rain. This
   caused its walls to collapse, resulting in a mudslide that ultimately
   covered an area 10 miles (16 km) long and 5 miles (8 km) wide.

   Two million people in Nicaragua were directly affected by the
   hurricane. Across the country, Mitch's heavy rains damaged 17,600
   houses and destroyed 23,900, displacing 368,300 of the population. 340
   schools and 90 health centers were severely damaged or destroyed.
   Sewage systems and the electricity subsector were severely damaged,
   and, combined with property, damage totaled to $300 million (1998 USD,
   $348 million 2005 USD).

   Transportation was greatly affected by the hurricane, as well. The
   rainfall left 70% of the roads unusable and destroyed or greatly
   damaged 71 bridges. Over 1,700 miles (2700 km) of highways or access
   roads needed replacement subsequent to the storm, especially in the
   northern part of the country and along portions of the Pan-American
   Highway. Total transportation damage amounted to $300 million (1998
   USD, $348 million 2005 USD). Agricultural losses were significant,
   including the deaths of 50,000 animals, mostly bovines. Crops and
   fisheries were affected greatly as well, and, combined with
   agricultural losses, damage totaled to $185 million (1998 USD, $214
   million 2005 USD).

   The situation was further compounded by a total of 75,000 live land
   mines — left over from the Contra insurgency of the 1980s — that were
   calculated to have been uprooted and relocated by the floodwaters.

   In all, Hurricane Mitch caused at least 3,800 fatalities in Nicaragua,
   of which more than 2,000 were killed from the mudslide at the Casitas
   volcano. The mudslide buried at least four villages completely in
   several feet of mud. Throughout the entire country, the hurricane left
   between 500,000 and 800,000 homeless. In all, damage in Nicaragua is
   estimated at around $1 billion (1998 USD, $1.16 billion 2005 USD).

Caribbean Sea

   Mitch was also responsible for the loss of the Fantome windjammer
   sailing ship owned by Windjammer Barefoot Cruises; all 31 of the crew
   perished. The story was recorded in the book The Ship and The Storm by
   Jim Carrier ( ISBN 0-07-135526-X). The ship, which was sailing in the
   centre of the hurricane, experienced up to 50 foot (15 m) waves and
   over 100 mph (160 km/h) winds, causing the Fantome to sink off the
   coast of Honduras.

   On the south coast of Cuba, the hurricane caused waves of up to 13 feet
   (4 m) high and winds gusts peaking at 42 mph (67 km/h), causing
   numerous tourists and workers on the Isle of Youth and Cayo Largo del
   Sur to leave for safer grounds.

   In Jamaica, where officials declared hurricane warnings 12 hours prior
   to its closest approach, Mitch caused moderate rainfall and gusty winds
   for days. Strong waves hit western Jamaica, with wave heights
   unofficially estimated at nearly 7 feet (2 m) in height. The rainfall
   in outer rainbands, at times severe, flooded many roads across the
   island and left them covered with debris. One house in Spanish Town
   collapsed from the flooding, leaving four homeless. Many other homes
   and buildings were flooded, forcing many to evacuate. A river in
   northeastern Jamaica overflowed its banks, while heavy rainfall across
   the mountainous parts of the country caused numerous mudslides. In all,
   Mitch killed three people on Jamaica.

   On the Cayman Islands, the hurricane caused strong waves, gusty winds,
   and heavy rainfall at times. Damage was relatively minimal, amounting
   to blown out windows and beach erosion. Strong waves damaged or
   destroyed many docks on the south shore of the islands, and also sank
   one dive ship near Grand Cayman. In addition, numerous incoming and
   outgoing flights were cancelled.

   Due to Mitch's large circulation, it dropped heavy precipitation as far
   south as Panama, especially in the Darién and Chiriquí provinces. The
   flooding washed away a few roads and bridges, and damaged numerous
   houses and schools, leaving thousands homeless. The hurricane left
   three casualties in Panama.

   In Costa Rica, Mitch dropped heavy rains, causing flash flooding and
   mudslides across the country, mostly in the northeastern part of the
   country. The storm impacted 2,135 homes to some degree, of which 242
   were destroyed, leaving 4,000 homeless. Throughout the country, the
   rainfall and mudslides affected 126 bridges and 800 miles (1300 km) or
   roads, mostly on the Inter-American Highway which was affected by
   Hurricane Cesar, two years prior. Mitch affected 115 sq. miles (300
   km²) of crop lands, causing damage to both export and domestic crops.
   In all, Hurricane Mitch caused $92 million in damage (1998 USD, $107
   million 2005 USD) and seven deaths.

   While drifting through El Salvador, the hurricane dropped immense
   amounts of precipitation, resulting in flash flooding and mudslides
   through the country. Multiple rivers, including the Río Grande de San
   Miguel and the Lempa River overflowed, contributing to overall damage.
   The flooding damaged more than 10,000 houses, leaving around 59,000
   homeless and forcing 500,000 to evacuate. Crop damage was severe, with
   serious flooding occurring on 386 sq. miles (1000 km²) of pasture or
   crop land. The flooding destroyed 37% of the bean production, 19% of
   the corn production, and 20% losses in sugar canes. There were heavy
   losses in livestock as well, including the deaths of 10,000 cattle.
   Total agricultural and livestock damaged amounted to $154 million (1998
   USD, $176 million 2005 USD). In addition, the flooding destroyed two
   bridges and damaged 1,200 miles (2000 km) of unpaved roads. In all,
   Mitch caused nearly $400 million in damage (1998 USD, $464 million 2005
   USD) and 240 deaths.

   Similar to the rest of Central America, Mitch's heavy rains caused
   mudslides and severe flooding over Guatemala. The flooding destroyed
   6,000 houses and damaged 20,000 others, displacing over 730,000 and
   forcing over 100,000 to evacuate. In addition, the flooding destroyed
   27 schools and damaged 286 others, 175 severely. Flooding caused major
   damage to crops, while landslides destroyed crop land across the
   country. The most severely affected crops for domestic consumption were
   tomatoes, bananas, corn, other vegetables, and beans, with damaged
   totaling to $48 million (1998 USD, $52 million 2005 USD). Export crops
   such as bananas or coffee were greatly damaged as well, with damage
   amounting to $325 million (1998 USD, $375 million 2005 USD). Damage to
   plantations and soil totaled to $121 million (1998 USD, $140 million
   2005 USD). The flooding also caused severe damage to the transportation
   infrastructure, including the loss of 37 bridges. Across the country,
   flooding damaged or destroyed 840 miles (1350 km) or roads, of which
   nearly 400 miles (640 km) were sections of major highways. In all,
   Hurricane Mitch caused $748 million (1998 USD, $867 million 2005 USD)
   and 268 deaths in Guatemala. In addition, Mitch caused 11 indirect
   deaths when a plane crashed during the storm.

   In Belize, the hurricane was less severe than initially predicted,
   though Mitch still caused heavy rainfall across the country. Numerous
   rivers exceeded their crests, though the rainfall was benefical to
   trees in mountainous areas. The flooding caused extensive crop damage
   and destroyed many roads. Throughout the country, eleven people died
   because of the hurricane.

   In Mexico, Mitch produced gusty winds and heavy rains on the Yucatán
   Peninsula, with Cancún on the Quintana Roo coast being the worst hit.
   Nine people were killed from the flooding, though damage was relatively
   minimal. The maximum 24 hour rainfall total from Mitch was 13.4 inches
   in Campeche,, while the highest rainfall total was 16.85 inches in
   Ciudad del Carmen.

Florida

   Then a tropical storm, Mitch caused a storm surge of up to four feet in
   the lower Florida Keys before making landfall on the Florida west
   coast. Key West International Airport reported peak wind gusts of 55
   mph (89 km/h) )and sustained winds of 40 mph (64 km/h), the only report
   of tropical storm force in the state. In addition, Mitch caused
   moderate rainfall, peaking at seven inches (18 cm) in Jupiter, though
   some estimates indicate localized totals of up to 10 inches (25 cm).
   The storm spawned five tornadoes over the state, of which the strongest
   was an F2.

   In the Florida Keys, multiple buildings that had been damaged by
   Hurricane Georges were leveled by Mitch. Tornadoes from the storm
   damaged or destroyed 645 houses across the state, as well as injuring
   65 people. Gusty winds left 100,000 without power during the storm's
   passage. In all, Mitch caused $40 million in damage (1998 USD, $46
   million 2005 USD) in Florida and two deaths from drowning when two
   boats capsized.

Aftermath

   After the disaster caused by Hurricane Mitch, countries around the
   world donated significant aid, including $6.3 billion (1998 USD, $7.3
   billion 2005 USD). Throughout Central America, which was recovering
   from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996, many wished to continue
   the growth of the infrastructure and economy. In addition, after
   witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes, the affected governments
   endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring again.

   Hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes, but many took this as
   an opportunity to rebuild stronger houses. With a new, structually
   improved foundation, homes were redesigned to be able to withstand
   another hurricane. However, lack of arable crop land took away the jobs
   from many, decreasing an already low income even lower.

   Following the passage of Mitch, disease outbreaks occurred throughout
   Central America, including cholera, leptospirosis, and dengue fever.
   Over 2,328 cases of cholera were reported, killing 34 people. Guatemala
   was most affected by the virus, where most of the deaths occurred from
   contaminated food. 450 cases of leptospirosis were reported in
   Nicaragua, killing seven people. There were over 1,357 cases of dengue
   reported, though no deaths were reported from the disease.

   While stalling over the western Caribbean Sea, Mitch's strong winds
   produced strong waves, damaging local coral reefs. Later, the storm's
   immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water.
   This resulted in diseases occurring within the coral. However, the
   hurricane's upwelling cooled the warm water temperatures, preventing
   significant bleaching and destruction of the coral reef.

   Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received
   significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico
   quickly gave help, sending 700 tons of food, 11 tons of medicine, four
   rescue planes, rescue personnel, and trained search dogs. Cuba also
   volunteered, sending a contingent of physicians to the country. The
   U.S. administration offered at first troops stationed in Honduras, and
   then withdrew them a few days after the storm. They also at first
   offered only $2 million (1998 USD, $2.3 million 2005 USD) in aid, which
   came as a shock to residents, and president Carlos Roberto Flores
   alike. The U.S. later increased their offer to $70 million (1998 USD,
   $81 million 2005 USD). The Honduran government distributed food, water,
   and medical services to the hurricane victims, including the more than
   4 million without water. In addition, the country initially experienced
   a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, largely due to the
   destruction of crop lands. However, rebuilding provided jobs in the
   following years. In Costa Rica, reconstruction after the hurricane
   increased the number of jobs by 5.9%, lowering the unemployment rate
   slightly.

Retirement

   Because of the hurricane's destruction in Central America and elsewhere
   in North America, the World Meteorological Organization retired the
   name Mitch in the spring of 1999; it will never again be used for an
   Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced with Matthew in the 2004
   season.
