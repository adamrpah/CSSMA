   Sand sharks, or sand tigers, are lamniform sharks of the family
   Odontaspididae (or sometimes referred to as Carchariidae). They are
   found on both sides of the Atlantic coast, but most notably in the Gulf
   of Maine. There are four species in two genera.

Anatomy

   Sand sharks have a large second dorsal fin. They typically grow to 5 to
   9 ft on average. The body tends to be brown in colour with dark
   markings in the upper half. It also has a flattened snout.

Reproduction

   Sand sharks only develop two embryos, one in each uterus. The strongest
   pups eat the other embryos before being born. They have a gestation
   period of about 9 to 12 months.
