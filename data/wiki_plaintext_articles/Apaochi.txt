   Apaochi was a leader of the Khitan tribes (who spoke Mongol) located in
   northwestern China. He served for three years as the [khan]] of these
   tribes, at the end of which he refused to resign and declared himself
   king of the entire nation of Khitan. He later declared himself emperor
   in 907 when Tang rule over China collapsed; by 916, he had created a
   dynasty that was typical of China in those times- and his son was his
   heir to the throne. He organized ordos (groups of warriors) from among
   his people (these are similar to hordes, a term invented later), and he
   later grouped 12 of these groups into an administrative district.

   By 926, Apaochi had helped the founder of the Later Chin dynasty in his
   conquest of northern China, which prompted this founder to give Apaochi
   the northeastern corner of Hopeh province to rule over (this territory
   is located where modern day Peking is located). When Apaochi died, his
   people (the Khitans) began to emulate more Chinese customs; by 947 they
   started the Liao dynasty and claimed Apaochi as the founder of this
   dynasty, giving him the honorable title of Tai Tsu (which means Grand
   Progenitor).
