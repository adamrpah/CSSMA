   "You're Still the One" is a Grammy Award winning song by Canadian
   singer Shania Twain. It was the third country single from Shania
   Twain's 1997 album, Come on Over, while it was the first to be released
   to pop and international markets. Released in 1998, the single peaked
   at number two becoming Twain's first top ten hit on the Billboard Hot
   100. Although it never topped the chart, the song is recognized as
   Twain's most successful crossover single, and is one of her most
   successful singles at country radio. The song was written by Twain and
   Mutt Lange and produced by Lange.

   "You're Still the One" was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 1999,
   and won two. It won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal
   Performance and lost Record of the Year and Song of the Year to Celine
   Dion's " My Heart Will Go On".

Song information

   Unlike many of her other singles, "You're Still the One" is based on
   the true story of the romantic times and trials between her and Lange,
   and how the relationship was able to survive. When Twain and Lange had
   become romantically involved in the mid 1990s, there was criticism of
   their relationship: claims that the age difference was extreme, and
   that Twain was solely using him to further her career. In essence, the
   critics did not expect their relationship to last. However, the
   relationship has been able to survive, Twain disagreed with these
   criticisms and wanted to address them in public and this led to her
   writing "You're Still the One". In this ode to the union between her
   and Lange, Twain explains how she is glad they did not listen to the
   critics, as if they had done, look at what they could have been
   missing. However, that is not to say that their romance is dead just
   because they are married now. If anything Twain believes that the
   romance is just as strong as it was before, causing her to belt,
   "You're still the one I run to, the one that I belong to, you're the
   one I want for life".

Music video

   The music video for "You're Still the One" was shot in Malibu and Los
   Angeles, California completely in black and white. It was directed by
   David Hogan and shot on December 4 and 5, 1997. It was released on
   January 26, 1998. It depicts Twain on a beach at night and features
   model John Devoe, who later appeared in her video for " That Don't
   Impress Me Much". The video received heavy rotation, it was Twain's
   first video to be played on non-country specific stations such as MTV,
   VH1, and MuchMusic. The video won awards at the Billboard Music Video
   Awards, VH1 Viewer's Choice Awards, and was nominated for an MTV Video
   Music Award. Two versions of the video were made, one with the
   'Original Album Version', released to country channels, and the
   'International Version' released to pop and international stations. The
   'International Version' of the video is available on Twain's DVD The
   Platinum Collection.

   Tracks chart the week of January 24, 1998 at number 75. The single
   spent 24 weeks on the chart, her longest stay at the time, and climbed
   to a peak position of number-one on May 2, 1998, where it remained for
   one week. The single became Twain's sixth number-one single, seventh
   top ten single and her ninth top twenty. "You're Still the One" spent

   on the Hot Country Recurrents chart.

   At adult contemporary radio, "You're Still the One" debuted number 26,

   chart and quickly climbed to a peak position of number one on June 27,
