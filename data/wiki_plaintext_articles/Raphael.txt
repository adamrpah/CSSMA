   Raphael or Raffaello ( April 6, 1483 – April 6, 1520), born in Urbino,
   Italy, was a master painter and architect of the Florentine school in
   the Italian High Renaissance, celebrated for the perfection and grace
   of his paintings. He was also called Raffaello Sanzio, Raffaello Santi,
   Raffaello da Urbino or Rafael Sanzio da Urbino.

Early life and work

   The surname Sanzio derives from the latinization of the Italian, Santi,
   into Santius (also, when signing solely using his baptismal name,
   "Raphael"). His father, Giovanni Santi, was also a painter in the court
   of Urbino.

   In 1491, his mother Màgia died; his father died on August 1, 1494,
   having already remarried. Thus orphaned at eleven, Raphael was
   entrusted to his uncle Bartolomeo, a priest. He had already shown
   talent, according to Giorgio Vasari - he tells that since childhood
   Raphael had been "a great help to his father". His father's workshop
   continued and probably together with his stepmother, Raphael evidently
   played a part in managing it from a very early age. He is described as
   a "master" in 1501.

   In Urbino he came into contact with the works of Uccello and
   Signorelli. According to Vasari, his father placed him in Perugino's
   workshop as an apprentice "despite the tears of his mother"; the
   subsequent influence of Perugino on Raphael's early work is most
   obvious. The evidence of an apprenticeship comes only from Vasari, and
   has been disputed. But most modern historians agree that Raphael worked
   as an assistant to Perugino from around 1500.

   His first documented work was an altarpiece for the church of San
   Nicola of Tolentino in Città di Castello, a town halfway between
   Perugia and Urbino. It was ordered in 1500 and finished in 1501 (it was
   later seriously damaged during an earthquake in 1789 and today only
   fragments of it remain). In the following years he painted works for
   other churches there (like the Wedding of the Virgin, today in the
   Brera) and for Perugia.

Florence

   In 1504 he went to Florence, where he studied the work of Leonardo da
   Vinci and Michelangelo. He spent almost four years there (the so-called
   "Florentine period"), but continued to travel to and work in other
   places (Perugia, Urbino and perhaps also Rome). He made friends with
   the local painters, particularly Fra Bartolomeo, who influenced him to
   discard the thin, graceful style of Perugino for more grandiose and
   powerful forms.

Rome

   At the end of 1508, he moved to Rome and was immediately commissioned
   by Julius II to paint some of the rooms at his palace at the Vatican.
   This marked a turning point - he was only twenty-five years old, an
   artist in formation, and had not received commissions of such
   importance and prestige. He well exploited the situation, and remained
   almost exclusively in the service of Julius and his successor Leo X.

   In 1514 he was named architect of the new St Peter's. Much of his work
   there was altered or demolished after his death, but he designed other
   buildings, and for a short time was both the most important architect
   and painter in Rome. In 1515 he was entrusted with the preservation and
   recording of the Vatican collections of ancient sculpture.

   After his arrival in Rome, he devoted his efforts to the great Vatican
   projects, although he still painted portraits of his two main patrons,
   the popes Julius II and his successor Leo X, the latter portrait
   considered one of his finest.

   One of his most important papal commissions was the Raphael Cartoons
   (now Victoria and Albert Museum), a series of 10 cartoons for
   tapestries with scenes of the lives of Saint Paul and Saint Peter,
   intended as wall decoration for the Sistine Chapel. The cartoons were
   sent to Bruxelles to be sewn in the workshop of Pier van Aelst; the
   first three tapestries were sent to Rome in 1519. It is possible that
   Raphael saw the finished series before his death — they were completed
   in 1520 for Leo X.

   Raphael, who in Rome lived in Borgo, never married, but it appears that
   in 1514 he was engaged to Maria Bibbiena (a cardinal's granddaughter);
   she died in 1520. The other woman in his life was La Fornarina, a
   beauty named Margherita, the daughter of a baker (fornaro) named
   Francesco Luti from Siena who lived at via del Governo Vecchio.
   According to Vasari, his premature death on Good Friday (April 6, 1520)
   was caused by a night of excessive sex with her, after which he fell
   into a fever and, not telling his doctors that this was its cause, was
   given the wrong cure, which killed him. Whatever the cause, in his
   acute illness Raffaello had the wit to receive the last rites, and put
   his affairs in order. He took the care to dictate his will, in which he
   left sufficient funds for her care, entrusted to his loyal servant
   Bavera. Vasari underlines that Raphael was also born on a Good Friday,
   in 1483, on the 27th or 28th of March. At his request, he was buried in
   the Pantheon. Art historians and doctors debate whether the right hand
   on the left breast in La Fornarina reveal a cancerous breast tumour
   detailed and disguised in a classic pose of love .

Printmaking

   Raphael made no prints himself, but entered into a collaboration with
   Marcantonio Raimondi to produce engravings to Raphael's designs, which
   created many of the most famous Italian prints of the century, and was
   important in the rise of the reproductive print. A total of about 50
   prints were made; some were copies of Raphael's paintings, but other
   designs were apparently created only to be made into prints. Raphael
   made preparatory drawings, many of which survive, for Raimondi to
   translate into engraving. The two most famous original prints to result
   from the collaboration were Lucretia and The Massacre of the Innocents.
   Outside Italy, reproductive prints by Raimondi and others were the main
   way that Raphael's art was experienced until the twentieth century.

Legacy

   The Inscription in his marble ancient sarcophagus, a distichon written
   by Pietro Bembo, reads: "Ille hic est Raffael, timuit quo sospite
   vinci, rerum magna parens et moriente mori." Meaning (according to the
   sign beside it): "Here lies Raffaello who, when alive, Nature was
   afraid to be won by him, when he died, she wanted to die herself".

   Raphael was highly admired by his contemporaries. When compared to
   Michelangelo and Titian, he was sometimes considered inferior; at the
   same time, it was maintained that none of them shared all the qualities
   possessed by Raphael, "ease" in particular.
