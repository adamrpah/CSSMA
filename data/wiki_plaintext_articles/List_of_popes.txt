   Popes buried in St. Peter's

   This is a list of Popes of the Catholic Church.

   While the term "Pope" (Latin: papa "father'") is used in several
   churches to denote their high spiritual leaders, this title in English
   usage generally refers to the supreme earthly head of the Roman
   Catholic Church. The title itself has been used officially by the head
   of the Roman Catholic Church since the tenure of Pope Siricius.

   Hermannus Contractus may have been the first historian to number the
   popes continuously. His list ends in 1049 with Pope Leo IX as the
   number 154. On that basis, the current Pope Benedict XVI would be the
   267th pope.

   There is no official list of popes, but the Annuario Pontificio,
   published every year by the Vatican, contains a list that is generally
   considered to be the most authoritative. Its list is the one given
   here. The Annuario Pontificio's list gives Benedict XVI as the 265th
   pope.

   Several changes have been made in the list during the 20th century.
   Antipope Christopher was considered legitimate for a long time.
   Pope-elect Stephen was considered legitimate under the name Stephen II
   until the 1961 edition and erased then. Although these changes are no
   more controversial, a number of modern lists still include this "first
   Pope Stephen II". It is probable that this is because they are based on
   the 1913 edition of the Catholic Encyclopaedia, which is in the public
   domain.

   The pope also bears the spiritual titles Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus
   Christ, Successor of St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff
   of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan
   of the Roman Province and Servant of the Servants of God. Since 1929,
   the pope's temporal title has been Sovereign of the State of the
   Vatican City (the Holy See).
