   Mirabilis is a genus in the family Nyctaginaceae, perhaps the best know
   genus in the family. Its most famous species is Mirabilis jalapa, the
   Four-o'clock flower. Also see Mirabilis longiflora.

   There are several dozen species in the genus, of herbaceous plants,
   mostly found in the Americas. Sometimes they have tuberous roots which
   enables them to perennate through dry and cool seasons. They have
   small, deep-throated flowers, often fragrant.

   Although best known as ornamental plants, at least one species,
   Mirabilis expansa, mauka, is grown for food.
