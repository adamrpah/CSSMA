   Victoria (sometimes called Port Victoria or Mahé) is the capital city
   of the Seychelles and is situated on the north-eastern side of Mahé
   island. The city was first established as the seat of the British
   colonial government. As of 2002, the population is 24,970, which is
   approximately one third of the population of the Seychelles. Victoria
   is served by the Seychelles International Airport (completed in 1971.)

   The principal exports of Victoria are vanilla, coconuts, coconut oil,
   tortoise shell, soap, and guano.

   Attractions in the city include a clocktower modelled on that of
   Vauxhall Bridge in London, England, the Courthouse, the Victoria
   Botanical Gardens, the Victoria National Museum of History, the
   Victoria Natural History Museum and the Sir Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke
   Market. The city is also home to the national stadium and a polytechnic
   institute, while the inner harbour lies immediately east of the town,
   around which tuna fishing and canning form a major local industry. One
   of the largest bridges in Victoria was destroyed in the 2004 Indian
   Ocean earthquake.

    1. La Riviere Anglaise (English River)
    2. Mont Buxton
    3. Saint Louis
    4. Bel Air
