   The Yorkshire Dales are an area of high ground in North Yorkshire, West
   Yorkshire, and Cumbria, England. They constitute one of the twelve
   National parks of England and Wales

   Although many valleys all over Yorkshire are called "(name of river)+
   dale", such as Airedale or Calderdale, the Yorkshire Dales are usually
   deemed to be those valleys north of the Wharfe. Exceptions to the
   naming rule are Wensleydale, which is named after the town of Wensley
   rather than the River Ure, and Arkengarthdale, which was formed by
   Arkle Beck.

Geography

   The characteristic scenery is green upland pastures separated by
   dry-stone walls and grazed by sheep and cattle. The dales themselves
   are 'U' and 'V' shaped valleys, which were enlarged and shaped by
   glaciers, mainly in the most recent, Devensian ice age. The underlying
   rock is principally Carboniferous limestone (which results in a number
   of areas of limestone pavement) in places interspersed with shale and
   sandstone and topped with millstone grit. However, to the north of the
   Dent fault, the hills are principally older Silurian and Ordovician
   rocks, which make up the Howgill Fells.

   Many of the upland areas consist of heather moorland, used for grouse
   shooting in the months following August 12 each year (the ' Glorious
   Twelfth').

   Cumbria. Over 20,000 residents live and work in the park, which
