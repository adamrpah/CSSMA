   Regulus ignicapillus
   ( Temminck, 1820)

   The Firecrest, Regulus ignicapillus, is a very small passerine bird in
   the kinglet family. It breeds in most of temperate Europe, north Africa
   and Madeira. It is partially migratory, with northern and eastern birds
   wintering south of the breeding range. In winter it is often found with
   tit flocks.

   This is the second smallest European bird at 9 to 10cm. It is greenish
   above and has whitish underparts. It has two white wingbars, a black
   eye stripe and a white supercilium. It has a crest, orange in the male
   and yellow in the female, which is displayed during breeding, and gives
   rise to the English name for the species. This is a restless species,
   constantly on the move as it searches for insects, and frequently
   hovering. It resembles the Goldcrest, but its bronze shoulders and
   strong face pattern are distinctive.

   Firecrests on Madeira, previously treated as a subspecies R. i.
   madeirensis, are now treated as a distinct species Madeira Firecrest
   Regulus madeirensis; it has a shorter supercilium, duller orange crest
   and a longer bill.
