   Part of the
   2005 Atlantic hurricane season

   Hurricane Epsilon was a long lasting hurricane of the 2005 Atlantic
   hurricane season in late November and early December over the central
   Atlantic. Hurricane Epsilon was the twenty-seventh tropical or
   subtropical storm and the fifteenth hurricane of the season and was one
   of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded so late in the year.

   Hurricane Epsilon developed from an extratropical storm on November 29
   and gradually developed into a hurricane on December 2, despite a
   highly hostile environment. Epsilon then held onto hurricane status for
   several more days, frustrating the forecasters of the National
   Hurricane Centre, before finally dissipating on December 8.

Storm history

   Tropical Storm Epsilon developed out of an extratropical storm in the
   central Atlantic Ocean on November 29 that had gradually gained
   tropical characteristics in the wake of Tropical Storm Delta. It was
   well east of Bermuda at the time and never would get close to land.
   Epsilon gradually strengthened into a strong tropical storm before it
   weakened slightly on December 1. The official forecasts from the
   National Hurricane Centre predicted Epsilon would weaken further in the
   highly sheared environment before becoming an extratropical system
   again. Unexpectedly, Tropical Storm Epsilon strengthened again on
   December 2 and became a hurricane over cooler waters averaging 21–24°C
   (70–75°F) and continuing shear, conditions that are highly unfavorable
   to maintaining a tropical cyclone. The official forecasts continued to
   predict weakening and eventual dissipation but Epsilon defied them and
   remained at hurricane strength for several days. At one point on
   December 4 it was thought that Epsilon had briefly weakened into a
   tropical storm, but later analysis showed that Epsilon had never
   weakened at all. Hurricane Epsilon then strengthened further to its
   peak intensity of 85 mph (135 km/h) just hours later.

   Hurricane Epsilon frustrated the forecasters, and the lack of any
   weakening led NOAA hurricane forecaster Dr. Lixion Avila to say "There
   are no clear reasons — and I am not going to make one up — to explain
   the recent strengthening of Epsilon…" The storm maintained its
   hurricane status for five days while most of the six-hourly forecasts
   during that period called for it to weaken below that intensity. Dr.
   Avila also claimed that Epsilon had developed a structure similar to
   one of an annular hurricane, which enabled it to maintain its strength
   despite poor conditions.

   On December 7 a strong upper-level flow from the northwest disrupted
   the organization of Hurricane Epsilon. The continuing shear then
   finally weakened it into a tropical storm that day. It quickly weakened
   further into a tropical depression on December 8 and dissipated shortly
   thereafter.

Impact

   As Hurricane Epsilon stayed well out to sea and never approached land,
   no warnings or watches were issued. No ships reported experiencing
   tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no reports of
   damages or fatalities.

Records

   When Tropical Storm Epsilon formed on November 29, it was the first
   time that twenty-seven tropical or subtropical storms had formed in the
   Atlantic during one hurricane season. Hurricane Epsilon was only the
   sixth ever Atlantic hurricane recorded in December. Epsilon also spent
   more time as a hurricane during December than any other Atlantic storm
   (beating the old record held by Hurricane Lili of 1984).
