   Björn Rune Borg   (born June 6, 1956, in Stockholm, Sweden) is a former
   World No. 1 tennis player from Sweden regarded by some observers and
   tennis players as the greatest player in the sport's history. During a
   9-year career, he won 41 percent of the Grand Slam singles tournaments
   he entered (11 of 27) and 89.8 percent of the Grand Slam singles
   matches he played. Both are male open era records. In addition, Borg's
   six French Open singles titles are an all-time record. . He is the only
   player to have won in three consecutive years both Wimbledon and the
   French Open.

Career overview

   As a child growing up in Södertälje, a town near Stockholm, Borg became
   fascinated by a golden tennis racquet that his father had won as a
   prize at a ping pong tournament. His father gave him the racquet,
   beginning one of the brightest careers in tennis history.

   In 1972, at the age of 15, Borg became one of the youngest players ever
   to represent his country in the Davis Cup and won his debut singles
   rubber in five sets against seasoned professional Onny Parun of New
   Zealand. Later that year, he won the Wimbledon junior singles title.

   In 1973, Borg reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals in his first attempt.

   In 1974, aged 17 years and 11 months, Borg won his first top-level
   singles title at the Italian Open. Two weeks later, he won his first
   Grand Slam title at the French Open, coming back from two sets down in
   the final to defeat Manuel Orantes 2-6, 6-7, 6-0, 6-1, 6-1. Barely 18
   at the time, Borg was the youngest-ever male French Open champion (the
   record has since been lowered by Mats Wilander in 1982 and Michael
   Chang in 1989).

   In early 1975, Borg played Rod Laver, then 36 years old, in a semifinal
   of the World Championship Tennis (WCT) finals in Dallas, Texas, which
   Borg won 7-6, 3-6, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2. Borg lost to Arthur Ashe, another
   veteran of the tour, in the final.

   Borg retained his French Open title in 1975, beating Guillermo Vilas in
   the final in straight sets. Borg then reached the Wimbledon
   quarterfinals, where he lost in four sets to Ashe, the eventual
   champion.

   Borg also helped Sweden to win its first ever Davis Cup title in 1975.
   He won two singles and one doubles rubber in the final as Sweden beat
   Czechoslovakia 3-2. With his two singles wins in the final, Borg had
   put together a run of 19 consecutive wins in Davis Cup singles rubbers
   going back to 1973. That was already a record at the time. But Borg
   never lost another Davis Cup singles rubber, and, by the end of his
   career, he had stretched that winning streak to 33 – a Davis Cup record
   that still stands.

   Borg swept through Wimbledon in 1976 without losing a set, defeating
   the much-favoured Ilie Năstase in the final. Borg became the youngest
   male Wimbledon champion of the modern era at 20 years and 1 month (a
   record broken by Boris Becker, who won Wimbledon aged 17 in 1985). Some
   speculate that Borg's surviving the first week of Wimbledon, when the
   courts were slick and fast, was the key to his success. This might have
   been due to the unusually hot conditions that summer. The courts played
   slower in the second week, which suited Borg's baseline game. Borg also
   reached the final of the 1976 U.S. Open, which was now being played on
   clay courts. Borg lost in four sets to world #1 Jimmy Connors.

   Borg repeated his Wimbledon triumph in 1977, although this time he was
   pushed much harder. He won a close match over his good friend Vitas
   Gerulaitis in a semifinal 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 3-6, 8-6 . In the final, Borg
   was pushed to five sets for the third time in the tournament, this time
   by Connors. The win propelled Borg to the #1 ranking on the computer,
   albeit for just one week in August.

   Borg was at the height of his career from 1978 through 1980, winning
   the French Open and Wimbledon all three years.

   In 1978, Borg won straight-set finals over Vilas at the French Open and
   Connors at Wimbledon but was defeated in straight sets by Connors in
   the final of the U.S. Open, now held on hard courts in Flushing Meadow,
   New York. That autumn, Borg faced John McEnroe for the first time in a
   semifinal of the Stockholm Open (in the city of his birth) and was
   upset in straight sets 6-3, 6-4.

   Borg lost to McEnroe again in four sets in the final of the 1979 WCT
   Finals but was now overtaking Connors for the top ranking. Borg
   established himself firmly in the top spot with his fourth French Open
   singles title and fourth straight Wimbledon singles title, defeating
   Connors in a straight-set semifinal at the latter tournament. At the
   French Open, Borg defeated big-serving Victor Pecci in a four-set
   final, and at Wimbledon, Borg took five sets to overcome an even bigger
   server, Roscoe Tanner. Borg was upset by Tanner at the U.S. Open, in a
   four-set quarterfinal played under the lights.

   At the season-ending Masters tournament in January 1980, Borg survived
   a close semifinal against McEnroe 6-3, 6-7, 7-6 (7-3). He then beat
   Gerulaitis in straight sets, winning his first Masters and first title
   in New York. In June, he overcame Gerulaitis, again in straight sets,
   for his fifth French Open title.

   Borg won his fifth consecutive Wimbledon singles title in 1980 by
   defeating McEnroe in a five-set match often listed among the best
   Wimbledon finals ever played. In the fourth-set tiebreak, McEnroe saved
   five match points and Borg six set points before McEnroe won the set.
   Borg then won 19 straight points on serve in the deciding set and
   prevailed after 3 hours, 53 minutes.

   Borg lost to McEnroe in another five-set final, this one lasting 4
   hours and 13 minutes, at the 1980 U.S. Open. He then defeated McEnroe
   in the final of the Stockholm Open, 6-3, 6-4, and faced him one more
   time that season, in the round-robin portion of the year-end Masters,
   played in January 1981. With 19,103 fans in attendance, Borg won a
   deciding third-set tiebreak for the second year in a row, 6-4, 6-7,
   7-6(3). Borg then defeated Ivan Lendl for his second Masters title,
   6-4, 6-2, 6-2.

   Borg won what turned out to be his last Grand Slam title at the French
   Open in 1981, defeating Lendl in a five-set final. Borg's six French
   Open singles titles remains a record for a male player.

   In reaching the Wimbledon final in 1981, Borg stretched his winning
   streak at the All England Club to a record 41 matches. In a semifinal,
   Borg was down to Connors by two sets to none before coming back to win
   the match 0-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-0, 6-4. Borg's streak was brought to an end
   by McEnroe, who beat him in four sets.

   Borg's last Grand Slam final was a four set loss to McEnroe at the 1981
   U.S. Open.

   The spark seemed to have burned out of Borg's game by the end of 1981,
   and he was on the brink of burn-out. But Borg's announcement in the
   spring of 1983 that he was retiring from the game at the age of just 26
   was a shock to the tennis world.

   Borg was ranked the World No. 1 in six different stretches between 1977
   and 1981, totaling 109 weeks. Tennis commentators considered him as the
   best player from 1977 through 1980. During his career, he won a total
   of 77 (61 listed on the Association of Tennis Professionals website)
   top-level singles and 4 doubles titles.

   Borg won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality
   Award in 1979.

   Borg was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987.

   After retiring, Borg suffered a drug overdose, was rumoured to have
   attempted suicide (which he has denied), and had a turbulent
   relationship with his then-wife, the Italian singer Loredana Bertè. He
   later bounced back as the owner of the Björn Borg fashion label, whose
   most noted advertising campaigns asked Swedes (from the pages of a
   leading national newspaper) to "Fuck for the Future."

   In the early- 1990s, Borg attempted a comeback on the men's
   professional tennis tour. This time around, however, he was completely
   unsuccessful. Playing with his old wooden rackets in an attempt to
   regain his once-indomitable touch, he lost his first comeback match in
   1991 to Jordi Arrese at the Monte Carlo Open. A series of first-round
   losses to lowly-ranked players followed over the next two years. The
   closest he came to winning a match was in 1993 in Moscow, when he
   pushed Alexander Volkov to three sets and lost a final-set tie-breaker
   9-7. After that match, he retired from the tour for good and confined
   himself to playing on the senior tour, with modern rackets, where he
   delighted crowds by renewing his old rivalries with McEnroe, Connors,
   and Vilas.

   In March 2006, Bonhams Auction House in London announced that it would
   auction Borg's Wimbledon trophies and two of his winning rackets on
   June 21, 2006. Several players then called Borg wondering what he was
   thinking, but only McEnroe was able to make Borg reconsider. According
   to Dagens Nyheter – who had talked to Borg – McEnroe called from New
   York and asked, "What's up? Have you gone mad?" The conversation
   apparently persuaded Borg to buy out the trophies from Bonhams at an
   undisclosed amount.

   On December 10, 2006, the British Broadcasting Corporation gave Borg a
   Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented by Boris Becker.

Place among the all-time greats

   Aside from his records, the French-Wimbledon double he achieved three
   times consecutively was called by Wimbledon officials "the most
   difficult double in tennis" and "a feat considered impossible among
   today's players." No player has managed to achieve his double since
   (and indeed Andre Agassi is the only male player since Borg to win both
   the French Open and Wimbledon men's singles titles over the course of
   his career).

   The major blemishes in Borg's Grand Slam record are that he failed to
   win either the U.S. Open or the Australian Open during his career. He
   reached the final four times at the U.S. Open but never won. Borg chose
   to make the journey to the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he
   lost in the third round. Borg has stated publicly that he would have
   attempted to complete the calendar year Grand Slam and played in the
   Australian Open had he succeeded in winning the first three Grand Slam
   tournaments of the year, which he never did. (The Australian Open was
   held in December from 1977 to 1985.)

   In 2006, Sergio Cruz, the former Portuguese national champion who
   coached Jim Courier, explained why he believed Borg was the "undisputed
   best player ever."

   In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter
   and great player himself, included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest
   players of all time.

   Kramer considered the best player ever to have been either Don Budge
   (for consistent play) or Ellsworth Vines (at the height of his game).
   The next four best were, chronologically, Bill Tilden, Fred Perry,
   Bobby Riggs, and Pancho Gonzales. After these six came the "second
   echelon" of Rod Laver, Lew Hoad, Ken Rosewall, Gottfried von Cramm, Ted
   Schroeder, Jack Crawford, Pancho Segura, Frank Sedgman, Tony Trabert,
   John Newcombe, Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, Björn Borg, and Jimmy Connors.
   He felt unable to rank Henri Cochet and René Lacoste accurately but
   felt they were among the very best.

   In 2003, Bud Collins chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of
   all time.

Playing style

   Borg played from the baseline, with powerful ground-strokes and a
   two-handed backhand (very rare at the time and unorthodox). His calm
   court demeanor earned him the nickname of the "Ice Man" or "Ice-Borg".
   He hit the ball hard and high from the back of the court and brought it
   down with considerable top-spin.

   Borg is credited with developing the style of play that has come to
   dominate the game today.

Records and trivia

Grand Slam records

     * Borg won more Grand Slam singles titles in the open era (11) than
       any player until Pete Sampras (14). Borg competed in the Australian
       Open only once and retired after nine years.
     * Borg won more French Open singles titles (6) than any other male
       player in tennis history.
     * Borg won more Wimbledon singles titles (5) than any other male
       player since the abolition of the Challenge Round in 1922 until
       Sampras (7).
     * Borg won four consecutive French Open singles championships, an
       all-time record. He retired while on a winning streak of 28
       consecutive matches at the French Open.
     * Borg won more consecutive Wimbledon singles titles (5) than any man
       under modern rules. Only William Renshaw won more consecutive
       titles there (1881-86). In Renshaw's day, the defending champion
       played only one match, the Challenge Round. After the adoption of
       the current rules, Fred Perry established a record of three
       consecutive Wimbledon titles from 1934 through 1936, until Borg
       equalled it in 1978.
     * Borg's 41 consecutive match winning streak at Wimbledon remains an
       all-time record. Sampras came closest to this record with four
       consecutive Wimbledon titles from 1997 through 2000 (and 31
       consecutive match wins). From 2003 through 2006, Federer also won 4
       consecutive titles.
     * Borg played in six consecutive Wimbledon singles finals, still a
       record since the abolition of the Challenge Round in 1922.
     * Borg played in four consecutive French Open singles finals, a men's
       open era record. Ivan Lendl tied this mark.
     * Borg played in 16 Grand Slam singles finals, a male record for the
       open era (and second in tennis history only to 17 by Rod Laver).
       This record was broken by Lendl, who played in 19, and Sampras, who
       played in 18.
     * Borg won at least one Grand Slam singles title for eight
       consecutive years (1974–1981), an all-time men's record. Only
       Sampras has matched this (1993–2000).
     * Borg defeated more players (9) in Grand Slam singles finals than
       any male player in history. Sampras tied this mark.
     * Borg won 11 Grand Slam singles titles out of 27 tournaments played,
       giving him a male open era record 41 percent winning rate. (
       Margaret Court won 24 of the 47 Grand Slam singles tournaments she
       played during her career (51 percent), which spanned both the
       amateur and open eras. Considering just Court's performances during
       the open era, she won 11 of 21 Grand Slam singles events (52
       percent). Steffi Graf won 22 of the 54 Grand Slam singles
       tournaments she played during her career, which was entirely during
       the open era, matching Borg's winning percentage.)
     * In Grand Slam singles tournaments, Borg's match record is 141–16,
       giving him an 89.8 winning percentage, better than any male player
       ever. The only other male players in the open era with winning
       percentages over 80 are Federer (85), John McEnroe (82), Jimmy
       Connors (81.9), and Lendl (81.8).
     * Borg's 11 Grand Slam singles titles ties him at third with Laver on
       the all-time list, behind Sampras (14) and Roy Emerson (12).

Youngest to win

     * In 1972, Borg became the youngest-ever winner of a Davis Cup match,
       at age 15.
     * In 1974, one month before his 18th birthday, Borg became the
       youngest winner of the Italian Open. That record has since been
       broken.
     * In 1974, only days after his 18th birthday, Borg became the
       youngest man ever to hold a Grand Slam singles title. He retained
       that distinction until another Swede, Mats Wilander, won the French
       Open in 1982.
     * At 18, he was the youngest winner of the U.S. Professional
       Championships until Aaron Krickstein won in 1983.
     * In 1976 at age 20, Borg became the youngest winner of Wimbledon
       during the open era until Boris Becker became the youngest Grand
       Slam winner of all time by taking Wimbledon at age 17 years, 7
       months in 1985 (a record broken by Michael Chang who won the French
       Open when he was 17 years, 3 months in 1989).
     * Borg won his 11th Grand Slam singles title in 1981 at age 25, the
       youngest male to reach that number of titles. By comparison, Pete
       Sampras won his 11th at almost age 27, Roy Emerson at age 30, and
       Rod Laver at age 31.

Match competition

     * Borg compiled a 576-124 win-loss singles record, winning more than
       82 percent of the matches he played. By comparison, Pete Sampras
       won 77 percent during his career.
     * Borg won 14 consecutive five-set singles matches before losing to
       John McEnroe at the 1980 U.S. Open, a record for the open era.
     * In career five-set matches, Borg was 24-4. His 85.7 winning
       percentage was unrivalled in the open era, with Aaron Krickstein in
       second place at 75.7 percent (28-9). Five of Borg's wins were in
       Grand Slam finals, a mark that surpassed Bill Tilden (who won four)
       and has remained unequalled.
     * In 1980, Borg won the longest-ever Wimbledon singles final to that
       time, 3 hours and 53 minutes (the record stood until 1982). That

     * On the list of open era winning streaks, Borg is third (43
       consecutive tour matches in 1978). The only other men with winning
       streaks of at least 40 matches are Guillermo Vilas (46), Ivan Lendl
       (44), John McEnroe (42), and Roger Federer (41) (ongoing as of
       March 3, 2007).
     * Borg previously held the record for most consecutive wins on grass,
       with 41 victories (all at Wimbledon). Federer, who customarily

       has a 48 match winning streak on grass (2003 through 2006).

       consecutive victories.

       victories in 1977-79. Only Rafael Nadal with 62 (ongoing through
