   The Bohor Reedbuck (Redunca redunca) is an antelope native to central
   Africa, mostly living in grassland areas near water. It is reddish with
   lighter areas in the posterior and a white underbelly. Males have
   curved horns pointing forward and can weigh up to 55 kg (120 lb).

   Bohor Reedbucks live in small groups consisting of a few individuals or
   live alone. It is one of many central african animals that is active
   during the day but retreats to cooler areas during the daily
   temperature peaks.

   Bohor Reedbucks have a distinctive whistling (males) and a frog-like
   croaking (females). These animals become most verbose during ritual
   mating displays. Gestation period is about 7.5 months.
