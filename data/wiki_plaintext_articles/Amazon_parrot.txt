   An Amazon parrot is a large parrot of the genus Amazona native to the
   New World ranging from South America to Mexico and the Caribbean.

   Most amazons are predominantly green, with accenting colors that depend
   on the species and can be quite vivid. Amazons, like all parrots, are
   zygodactyl, having four toes on each footâ€”two front and two back. They
   feed primarily on nuts and fruits, supplemented by leafy matter.

   Several amazon species are commonly kept as companion animals,
   including the Yellow-headed Parrot, Yellow-naped Parrot, and
   Blue-fronted Parrot.

   Amazons are known for their exceptional vocal abilities, playfulness,
   and dexterity with their feet. They are very loyal, loving companions;
   having them is somewhat like having a two-year-old-human child in
   ability and temperament for 50-plus years. However, some amazons are
   aggressive (usually during their mating time), and they all require a
   lot of attention when kept as pets. Parrots require more attention and
   care than domesticated pets such as dogs or cats, and are not for the
   inexperienced bird owner. All parrots need a lot of stimulating
   activities to keep from being bored and terribly destructive to
   themselves and their surroundings. In particular, since Amazons are
   cavity nesters in the wild, their desire to chew wood is strong, and
   they need to be provided with destructible toys to satisfy this innate
   urge.

   sub-species, such as auropalliata and oratrix. However, new taxonomic
   classification puts those in their own species.
