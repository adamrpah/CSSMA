   Emberiza schoeniclus
   (Linnaeus, 1758)

   The Reed Bunting, Emberiza schoeniclus, is a passerine bird in the
   bunting family Emberizidae, a group now separated by most modern
   authors from the finches, Fringillidae.

   It breeds across Europe and much of temperate and northern Asia. Most
   birds are migrate south in winter, but those in the milder south and
   west of the range are resident. It is common in reedbeds and also
   breeds in drier open areas such as moorland and cultivation.

   The Reed Bunting is a medium sized bird, 13.5-15.5 cm long, with a
   small but sturdy seed-eater's bill. The male has a black head and
   throat, white neck collar and underparts, and a heavily streaked brown
   back. The female is much duller, with a streaked brown head, and is
   more streaked below.

   The familiar, if somewhat monotonous, song of the cock is a repetitive
   zrip.

   Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise
   seeds. The nest is in a bush or reed tussock. 4-7 eggs are laid, which
   show the hair-like markings characteristic of those of buntings.
