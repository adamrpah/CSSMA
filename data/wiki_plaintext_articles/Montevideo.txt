   Montevideo -pron IPA: [monteβi'ðeo] is the capital, largest city, and
   chief port of Uruguay. Given that it is more than twice as large as any
   other city in the country, it is considered a primate city. As of April
   2006, Montevideo is ranked by Mercer Human Resource Consulting as the
   city in Latin America with the highest quality of life.

Location/climate

   Montevideo is situated in the south of the country, at the northern
   mouth of the very wide River Plate ( Río de la Plata) estuary. The
   geographic coordinates are 34.5° S, 56°W.

   The climate is mild, with average temperatures of approximately 13°C,
   achieving 40°C or more in summer.

   18 de Julio, the city's main avenue and one of the finest of South
   America, extends from the Plaza Independencia, which is the junction
   between the Ciudad Vieja (the historical quarter) and the rest of the
   city, to the neighbourhood of Cordón

History

Origin of Name

   There are at least two explanations for the name Montevideo: The first
   states that it comes from the Portuguese "Monte vide eu" which means "I
   see a mountain". The second is that the Spaniards recorded the location
   of a mountain in a map as "Monte VI De Este a Oeste" meaning "The sixth
   mountain from east to west". The city's full original name is San
   Felipe y Santiago de Montevideo.

Early History

   The Portuguese founded Colonia del Sacramento in the 17th century
   despite Spanish claims to the area due to the Treaty of Tordesillas.
   The Spanish chased the Portuguese out of a fort in the area in 1724.
   Then, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala – governor of Buenos Aires – founded the
   city on December 24, 1726 to prevent further incursions.

   In 1828, the town became the capital of Uruguay.

   The city fell under heavy British influence from the early 19th century
   until the early 20th century as a way to circumvent Argentine and
   Brazilian commercial control. It was repeatedly besieged by Argentinean
   dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas between 1838 and 1851. Between 1860 and
   1911, the British built an extensive railroad network linking the city
   to the surrounding countryside.

20th Century

   During World War II, a famous incident involving the German pocket
   battleship Admiral Graf Spee took place in Montevideo, which was a
   neutral port during the war. After the Battle of the River Plate with
   the British navy on December 13, 1939, the Graf Spee retreated to the
   port. To avoid risking the crew in what he thought would be a losing
   battle, Captain Hans Langsdorff scuttled the ship on December 17.
   Langsdorff committed suicide two days later. On 10 February 2006, the
   eagle figurehead of the Admiral Graf Spee was recovered. To protect the
   feelings of those still sensitive to Nazi Germany, the swastika on the
   figurehead was covered as it was pulled from the water.

   Since 2005 the Mayor of Montevideo (styled Intendente Municipal in
   Spanish) has been Ricardo Ehrlich, of the Frente Amplio (Broad Front),
   gaining 61% of the vote in the Mayoral elections, beating Pedro
   Bordaberry of the Partido Colorado, who scored 27%.

   Unlike its more well-known neighbour, Buenos Aires (Argentina),
   Montevideo is blessed with a natural harbour.

Growth/economy

   Montevideo began as a minor settlement. In 1860, Montevideo had a
   population of 37,787. By 1884, the population had grown to 104,472,
   including many immigrants. By this time, trade had become the main
   source of revenue for the city and it became a rival to Buenos Aires.
   During the early 20th century, many Europeans, mostly from Spain and
   Italy, immigrated to the city, and by 1908, 30% of the population was
   foreign born.

   During the mid-20th century, military dictatorship and economic
   stagnation caused a decline whose residual effects are still seen
   today. Many rural poor flooded the city, with a large concentration in
   Ciudad Vieja.

   Recently, economic recovery and stronger trade ties with Uruguay's
   neighbours have led to renewed agricultural development and hopes for
   greater future prosperity.

   As of 2004, the city has a population of 1.35 million out of a total of
   3.43 million in the country as a whole. The greater metropolitan area
   has 1.8 million people.

   Montevideo is served by Carrasco International Airport.

   As of April 2006, Montevideo is ranked by Mercer Human Resource
   Consulting as the city in Latin America with the highest quality of
   life.

World City Formation

   The city shows some evidence of world city formation. The past lives on
   in style, though. Back in 1870, the average living standards there were
   higher than in the United States, and it shows. Take a walk through the
   Old City, where almost every street has a view of the water, sometimes
   at both ends, and you’ll discover a bounty of architectural treasures
   from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
