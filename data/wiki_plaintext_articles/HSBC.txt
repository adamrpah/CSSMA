   HSBC Holdings plc ( LSE: HSBA, SEHK: 005, NYSE: HBC, Euronext: HSBC,
   BSX: 1077223879) is one of the largest banking groups in the world,
   ranked the fifth-largest company and third-largest banking company in
   the world in Forbes Global 2000. Its head office is located in the HSBC
   Tower in London's Canary Wharf. The group is named after its founding
   member, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a bank
   established by Thomas Sutherland, a Scot, to finance British trade in
   the Far East in 1865.

   The bank is the second largest corporation in the world in terms of
   assets (as of Dec 31, $1.861 trillion, while Citigroup reported $1.884
   trillion). It reports its results in United States dollars, since 80%
   of its earnings originate from outside the United Kingdom. Nearly 22%
   of its earnings are from operations in Hong Kong, where it was
   headquartered until 1991. It is the largest bank in Hong Kong, and at
   the end of 2005 was the largest banking group in the world by Tier 1
   capital.

   The HSBC logo, known as the Hexagon, is derived from The Hongkong and
   Shanghai Banking Corporation’s 19th century house flag, itself derived
   from the Scottish flag, which is the angular cross that Saint Andrew
   (the patron saint of Scotland) was crucified upon.

Global product lines and programmes

Group Service Centres

   As a cost saving measure HSBC is offshoring processing work to lower
   cost economies in order to reduce the cost of providing services in
   developed countries. These locations take on work such as data
   processing and customer service, but also internal software engineering
   at Pune (India), Guangzhou (China) and in Curitiba (Brazil).

   The BBC quotes Chief Operating Officer, Alan Jebson in March 2005, as
   saying he would be very surprised if fewer than 25,000 people were
   working in the centres over the next three years: “I don’t have a
   precise target but I would be surprised if we had less than 15 (global
   service centres) in three years’ time”. He went on to say that each
   centre cost the bank from $20m to $30m to set up, but that for every
   job moved the bank saves about $20,000 (£10,400).

   The BBC go on to explain how trade unions, particularly in the US and
   UK, blame these centres for job losses in developed countries, and also
   for the effective imposition of wage caps on their members.

   Currently centres exist in six countries, in Brazil in Curitiba, in
   India in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Visakhapatnam, Mumbai, Kolkata and Pune,
   in China in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, in Kuala Lumpur
   (Malaysia), Colombo( Kotte) (Sri Lanka) and Manila (Philippines). There
   is also a trial going on in Malta to asses the possibility of
   offshoring a UK high value call centre. An option under consideration
   is reported to be a processing centre in Vietnam to access the French
   skills of the population and therefore cut costs in the bank’s French
   operation.

   On June 27th 2006, HSBC reported that a "small number" of customers had
   suffered from fraud totalling £233,000 after an employee at the
   Bangalore call centre supplied confidential customer information to
   fraudsters.

HSBC Premier

   The group has HSBC Premier as its premium financial services product -
   the brand name is used in many market places around the world, however
   the exact benefits and qualification criteria vary. Broadly customers
   have a dedicated Relationship Manager, global 24 hour access to Premier
   call centres, concierge services and preferential rates.

   Group, it focuses on providing offshore solutions and cross border
   services to expatriates and migrants. It provides a full range of
   multi-currency personal banking services to a range of customer
   segments, including a full internet banking and telephone banking
   service. Sometimes referred to as 'HSBC Offshore', the business also
   offers independent financial planning, and has representative offices
   all over the world, often working alongside local HSBC operations in
   those regions.

   its registered headquarters on the seafront in St Helier, Jersey. Named
   'HSBC House', the building comprises departments such as Premier,

Brand and Advertising

   The group announced in November 1998 that the HSBC brand and the
   hexagon symbol would be adopted as the unified brand in all the markets
   where HSBC operates, with the aim of enhancing recognition of the Group
   and its values by customers, shareholders and staff throughout the
   world.

Hexagon symbol

   This was originally adopted by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
   Corporation as its logo in 1983. It was developed from the bank’s house
   flag, a white rectangle divided diagonally to produce a red hourglass
   shape. Like many other Hong Kong company flags that originated in the
   19th century, the design was based on the cross of Saint Andrew. The
   logo was designed by Henry Steiner.

   Stewart Grand Prix, HSBC ended its relationship with the sport when Red
   Bull purchased Jaguar Racing from Ford. HSBC has now switched its focus
   to golf, taking title sponsorship of events such as the HSBC World
   Match Play Championship, HSBC Women’s World Match Play Championship and
   HSBC Champions.

   recently (Nov 2006) announced a $5m partnership with SOS Children as
   part of Future First.

   GBP or more than 20 billion US dollars.

Household Acquisition

   International, after Household settled on charges of predatory lending.
   The deal is now seen as in a much more positive light, The Banker
   suggests that "when banking historians look back, they may conclude
   that [it] was the deal of the first decade of the 21st century". HSBC
   is expanding the Household International consumer financial model to
   Brazil, India and elsewhere.
