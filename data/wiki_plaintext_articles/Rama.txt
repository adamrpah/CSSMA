   Rāmachandra, or Rama (rāma in IAST, राम in Devanāgarī or Śrī Rāma
   (श्रीराम in Devanagari), was a king of ancient India whose grand story
   is portrayed in the epic Ramayana, one of the two great epics of India.
   In Hinduism, he is also considered to be the Seventh Avatara of Vishnu
   and one of the most important manifestations of God. He is one of the
   most popular heroes of Hindu mythology and folktales in South and
   Southeast Asia. Born as the eldest son of Kausalya and Dasaratha, king
   of Kosala, he is the embodiment of the Supreme Brahman and Dharma. Rama
   is Maryada Purushottama, literally The Perfect Man. He is the hero of
   the ancient Hindu epic poem, The Ramayana (from Sanskrit, The Journey
   of Rama). Rama is the husband of Sita, who is also considered the
   Avatara of Lakshmi and the embodiment of perfect womanhood.

   Rama's life and journey is one of perfect adherence of dharma despite
   harsh tests of life and time. For the sake of his father's honour, Rama
   abandons his claim to Kosala's throne to serve an exile in the forest.
   The kidnapping of his wife Sita by Ravana, the Rakshasa monarch of
   Lanka leaves him desperate. After a long and arduous search that tests
   his personal strength and virtue, Rama fights a colossal war against
   Ravana's armies. In a war of powerful and magical beings, greatly
   destructive weaponry and battles, Rama slays Ravana in battle and
   liberates his wife. Having completed his exile, Rama returns to be
   crowned King in Ayodhya (the capital of his Kingdom) and eventually
   becomes Emperor of the World, after which he reigns for eleven thousand
   years - an era of perfect happiness, peace, prosperity and justice
   known as Rama Rajya.

   Rama's courage in searching for Sita and fighting a terrible war to
   rescue his wife and their honour is complemented by Sita's absolute
   devotion to her husband's love, and perfect chastity despite being
   Ravana's captive. Rama's younger brothers, namely Lakshmana, Shatrughna
   and Bharata strongly complement his piety, virtue and strength, and
   they are believed by many to belong to the Mariyada Purshottama and the
   Seventh Avatara, mainly embodied by Rama. Rama's piety and virtue
   attract powerful and devoted allies such as Hanuman and the Vanaras of
   Kishkindha, with whose help he rescues Sita. The legend of Rama is
   deeply influential and popular in the societies of the Indian
   subcontinent and across South East Asia. Rama is revered for his
   unending compassion, courage and devotion to religious values and duty.

Etymology of Rama

   Rāmá in the Rigveda and the Atharvaveda is an adjective meaning "dark,
   black", or a noun meaning "darkness", e.g. RV 10.3.3 (trans. Griffith):

          10.3.3cd Agni, far-spreading with conspicuous lustre, hath
          compassed Night [Rama] with whitely shining garments.

   As a personal name it appears in RV 10.93.14:

          10.93.14ab This to Duhsima Prthavana have I sung, to Vena, Rama,
          to the nobles [ Asuras], and the King.

   The feminine form of the adjective, rāmīˊ is an epitheton of the night
   ( Ratri), as is kṛṣṇīˊ, the feminine of kṛṣṇa, viz. "the dark one; the
   black one". Mayrhofer (1996) suggests a derivation from PIE
   (H)reh[1]-mo-, cognate to OHG rāmac "dirty".

   Two Ramas are mentioned in the Vedas, with the patronymics Mārgaveya
   and Aupatasvini; another Rama with the patronymic Jāmadagnya is the
   supposed author of a Rigvedic hymn. According to Monier-Williams, three
   Ramas were celebrated in post-Vedic times,
    1. Rāma-candra ("Rama-moon"), son of Dasaratha, descended from Raghu
       of the Lunar Dynasty, the subject of this article
    2. Parashu-rāma ("Rama of the Battle-axe"), the Sixth Avatara of
       Vishnu, sometimes also referred to as Jāmadagnya, or as Bhārgava
       Rāma (descended from Bhrigu), a "Chiranjeevi" or Immortal.
    3. Bala-rāma ("the strong Rama"), also called Halāyudha (Wielder of
       the Plough in Battle), the older cousin and close companion of
       Krishna, the Eighth Avatara of Vishnu.

   In the Vishnu sahasranama, Rama is the 394th name of Vishnu. In the
   interpretation of Adi Sankara's commentary, translated by Swami
   Tapasyananda of the Ramakrishna Mission, Rama has two meanings: the
   supreme Brahman who is the eternally blissful spiritual Self in whom
   yogis delight or the One (i.e., Vishnu) who out of his own will assumed
   the enchanting form of Rama, the son of Dasaratha.

Avatara

   The Ramayana speaks of how the Goddess Earth, Bhumidevi, came to the
   Lord Creator, Brahma begging to be rescued from evil kings who were
   plundering her resources and destroying life through bloody wars and
   evil conduct. The Devas also came to Brahma fearful of the rule of
   Ravana, the ten-headed rakshasa emperor of Lanka. Ravana had
   overpowered the Devas and now ruled the heavens, the earth and the
   netherworlds. Although a powerful and noble monarch, he was also
   arrogant, destructive and a patron of evil doers. He had boons that
   gave him immense strength and was invulnerable to all living and
   celestial beings, except man and animals.

   Brahma, Bhumidevi and the Devas worshipped Vishnu, the Preserver, for
   deliverance from Ravana's tyrannical rule. Vishnu promised to kill
   Ravana by incarnating as a man - the eldest son of Kosala's king
   Dasaratha. His eternal consort, Lakshmi took birth as Sita, daughter of
   King Janaka of Mithila and Goddess Bhumi. Vishnu's eternal companion,
   the Ananta Sesha is said to have incarnated as Lakshmana to stay at his
   Lord's side on earth. Throughout his life, no one, except himself and a
   few select sages (among which are included Vasishta, Sharabhanga,
   Agastya and Vishwamitra) know of his destiny. Rama is continually
   revered by the many sages he encounters through his life, but only the
   most learned and exalted know of his true identity. At the end of the
   war between Rama and Ravana, just as Sita passes her Agni pariskha,
   Lord Brahma, Indra and the Devas, the celestial sages and Lord Shiva
   appear out of the sky. They affirm Sita's purity and ask him to end
   this terrible test. Thanking the Avatara for delivering the universe
   from the grips of evil, they reveal Rama's divine identity upon the
   culmination of his mission.

Prince of Ayodhya

   King Dasaratha performs a putrakami yajna, a sacrifice to obtain
   offspring by pleasing the Gods. He gives the sacred, sacrificial nectar
   to his three wives according to their seniority: Kousalya, Sumitra and
   Kaikeyi. On the night of the ninth day after Amavasya, under the
   asterism of Punarvasu and the cardinal sign of the Crab, Rama was born
   in the city of Ayodhya, which is the capital of the ancient kingdom of
   Kosala. The city and the area are located in the central region of the
   modern state of Uttar Pradesh in India. Rama was the prince of the
   Suryavamsha ( Sun Dynasty) House of Ikshvaku, descendant of great
   monarchs like Ikshvaku, Raghu and Bhagiratha. He is the eldest brother
   to Bharata, son of Kaikeyi, and the twin sons of Sumitra, Lakshmana and
   Shatrughna. Rama is dark-complexioned, mainly bluish - a symbol of
   divinity.

   The Ramayana describes the relationship between the brothers as
   intensely loving and devotional, although Rama and Lakshmana share a
   special, inseparable bond, while Bharata is especially close to
   Shatrughna. The four brothers enjoy an undiscriminating love from
   Dasaratha and his three queens, but Dasaratha's main affections are
   affixed upon Rama. Rama and his brothers are trained by Rishi Vasishta
   in the Vedas, religion, philosophy and the sciences. They are described
   as taller than the tallest men of modern times, possessive of
   exceptional acumen and prowess in the military sciences and arts.

Initiation of the Avatara

   Rama breaking the bow, Raja Ravi Varma (1848-1906)

   Rama breaking the bow, Raja Ravi Varma (1848-1906)

   Sage Vishwamitra takes the two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, to the
   Swayamvara ceremony for Sita. The challenge is to string the bow of
   Shiva, and shoot an arrow with it. This task is considered impossible
   for any ordinary king or living being, as this is the personal weapon
   of Shiva, more powerful, holy and of divine creation than conceivable.
   While attempting to string the bow, Rama breaks it into two. This feat
   of unbelievable strength, to have broken the bow of Shiva, spreads his
   fame across the worlds and seals his marriage to Sita.

   After Rama weds Sita and the entire royal family and the Ayodhya army
   begin their journey back, the great rishi Parashurama Bhargava appears
   before them, having descended from his mountainous hermitage.
   Parashurama is an extremely powerful rishi, responsible for killing all
   of the world's warriors and kings 21 times. He was the sixth Avatara of
   Vishnu, and finds it unbelievable that anybody could break the bow of
   Shiva. Considering himself to still be the most powerful warrior-rishi
   on earth, he brings with them the bow of Vishnu, and intends to
   challenge Rama to prove his strength by stringing it, and then fighting
   a battle with him to prove superiority. Although the entire Ayodhya
   army is forestalled by his mystical power, Rama is himself angered. He
   respectfully bows to Parashurama, and within a twinkling of an eyelid
   snatches the bow of Vishnu, strings it, places an arrow and points it
   straight at the challenger's heart. Rama asks Parashurama what he will
   give as a target to the arrow in return for his life? At this point,
   Parashurama feels himself devoid of the tremendous mystical energy he
   possessed for so long. He realizes that Rama is Vishnu incarnate, his
   successor and definitely his superior. He accepts Rama's superiority,
   devotes his tapasya to him, pays homage to Rama and promises to return
   to his hermitage and leave the world of men.

   Rama then fired the arrow up into the sky with Vishnu's bow, performing
   a feat true to his Supreme, divine nature with his natural weapon. His
   overpowering of Parashurama and using the supreme weapon with
   incredible ease and perfection dazzle the spectators and his relatives,
   but no one save Parashurama and Vasishta associate this with his true
   identity. It is said that the Rama's arrow is still flying across
   space, across time and across all of the universe. The day it will
   return to earth, it is said, it will bring the end of the world. Others
   say that the flying arrow destroys all evil on earth to uphold dharma
   and righteousness.

Another version

   Another version of the story is, that Sage Vishvamitra along with
   Prince Rama and Lakshmana attended the Swayamvara of Sita Princess
   Sita. To find the best match for Sita, King Janaka held a test in which
   the successful contestant was able to lift the bow of Lord Shiva and
   string it, would be able to wed Sita. However, none of the Kings were
   able to achieve this task, and disappointed, King Janaka pours out his
   dilemma and misery. Upon hearing this Lakshmana is enraged and offended
   that King Janaka did not offer Rama the same test. Upon the invitation
   of King Janaka, Lord Rama proceeded to the bow of Lord Shiva. Paying
   reverence to the bow, Rama was able lift the bow, string it and in the
   same process broke the bow in two. This event sent a loud thundering
   sound throughout the whole planet and the noise reached the ears of
   Parasurama who was at that time meditating and knew that the sound made
   was the bow of Lord Shiva's being broken. When Parasurama arrived at
   the court of King Janaka, he confronted the prince and issued a
   challenge. This led to a confrontation between Lakshmana and
   Parusurama, who's rage was increasing at Lakshmana's impetuous
   backtalk. However, Lord Rama without any physical confrontation was
   able to pacify Parasurama. After calming down Parasurama realised that
   Rama was Lord Vishnu Incarnate and granted Lord Rama all the weapons he
   had obtained from his tapas.

Dharma of exile

   King Dasaratha announces to Ayodhya that he plans to crown Rama, his
   eldest child the yuvaraja (crown prince). While the news is welcomed by
   everyone in the kingdom, the mind of queen Kaikeyi is poisoned by her
   wicked maid-servant, Manthara. Kaikeyi, who is initially pleased for
   Rama, is made to fear for the safety and future of her son Bharata.
   Fearing that Rama would ignore or possibly victimize his youngest
   brother for the sake of power, Kaikeyi demands that Dasaratha banish
   Rama to a forest exile for fourteen years, and that Bharata be crowned
   in Rama's place. She had been granted two boons by the king when she
   had saved his life a long time ago, and the queen now used them to
   serve her purpose. The king's court and the people are outraged at this
   turn of events. Dasaratha loved and cherished Rama dearly, and was in
   personal turmoil. Completely estranged now from his younger wife, he
   abhors the prospect of separation from Rama. But Rama realizes that the
   king must not break a solemn promise at any time, and neither should a
   son disobey his father's command. Sita joins her husband in exile
   despite his discouraging her, as it is her duty and out of love for
   Rama that she must be at his side at all times. His younger brother
   Lakshmana also immediately decides to join Rama rather than remain in
   the city.

   As he leaves for exile, the people of Ayodhya are deeply saddened and
   angered at Dasaratha and Kaikeyi. Dasaratha's heart is broken and he
   collapses and dies by the next day, unable to bear the agony of
   separation from Rama. Despite the reasoning of Vasishtha and the pleas
   of his brothers, Rama refuses to return. Although horrified at the news
   of his father's death, Rama finds it impossible that he should break
   his dead father's word. Rama does not bear any anger towards Kaikeyi,
   believing firmly in the power of destiny. According to the explanation
   of the classic, this exile actually presents Rama the opportunity to
   confront Ravana and his evil empire.

Rama and Sita

   Rama and Sita are the protagonists in one of the most famous love
   stories of all time. They are deeply and natural in love and union as
   they are Vishnu and Lakshmi incarnate respectively, and embody the
   perfect manhood and womanhood respectively. When Rama is banished from
   the kingdom, he attempts to convince Sita not to join him in a
   potentially dangerous and certainly arduous existence in the jungle,
   but Sita rejects this. When Rama orders her in his capacity as husband,
   Sita rejects it, asserting that it was an essential duty of a wife to
   be at her husband's side come good or ill. Rama in turn is assiduously
   protective and caring for Sita throughout the exile.

   When Sita is kidnapped by Ravana, both Sita and Rama undergo great
   personal hardships during their separation. Sita protects her chastity
   assiduously, and survives over a year in captivity on the strength of
   her love and assiduous attention to religious values and duty. She is
   completely unfettered in her resolve despite Ravana's courting,
   cajoling and threats. Meanwhile Rama, not knowing who had kidnapped
   Sita or where was she taken, often succumbs to despair and tears,
   denouncing himself for failing to defend her and agonizing over her
   safety and pain. Sita knows that it is in Rama's destiny to fight to
   rescue her (she refuses to be rescued thus by Hanuman, who discovers
   her), but is deeply anxious for his safety and fearful of Ravana's
   power.

Agni pariksha

   After Rama slays Ravana and wins the war, Sita wants to come before him
   in the state which over a year's imprisonment had reduced her to, Rama
   arranges for Sita to be bathed and given beautiful garments before they
   are re-united. But even as Sita comes before him in great excitement
   and happiness, Rama does not look at her, staring fixedly at the
   ground. He tells her that he had fought the war only to avenge the
   dishonour that Ravana had inflicted on Rama, and now Sita was free to
   go where she pleased. At this sudden turn of events, all the vanaras,
   rakshasas, Sugriva, Hanuman and Lakshmana are deeply shocked.

   A devastated Sita, shaking with grief and humiliation, begs Lakshmana
   to build her a pyre upon which she could end her life, as she could not
   live without Rama. At this point, Lakshmana is angered at Rama for the
   first time in his life, but following Rama's nod, he builds a pyre for
   Sita. At the great shock and sorrow of the watchers, Sita walks into
   the flames. But to their greater shock and wonder, she is completely
   unharmed. Instead, she glows radiantly from the centre of the pyre.
   Immediately Rama runs to Sita and embraces her. He had never doubted
   her purity for a second, but, as he explains to a dazzled Sita, the
   people of the world would not have accepted or honoured her as a queen
   or a woman if she had not passed this Agni pariksha before the eyes of
   millions, where Agni would destroy the impure and sinful, but not touch
   the pure and innocent.

Sita's banishment

   In the Uttara Kanda, Rama banishes his wife Sita, even as she is
   pregnant with his child, asking Lakshmana to deliver her safely to
   Rishi Valmiki's ashram. He does so when it is reported to him that some
   subjects of his in Ayodhya believe that Sita is unchaste due to her
   long captivity in Ravana's city. The Agni pariksha fails to convince
   these few critics, but Rama, by his understanding of the dharma of a
   king, decides to banish Sita. Rama adhered strictly to his duty both as
   a king and a husband. These conflicted when society thought that Sita
   was unfit to become queen. But Rama had to send away Sita since his
   duty of king came first. Sita herself told him to send her away since
   she perfectly understood the situation and knew Rama's dilemma.

   A legend by Rishi Agastya in the epic states that Vishnu in a previous
   age had been cursed by a rishi, whose wife had been killed by Vishnu
   for sheltering his enemies escaping from battle. The Rishi condemns
   Vishnu to be denied for a long age, the companionship of his soul mate,
   just as Vishnu, by an inadvertent display of anger, had deprived the
   rishi of his loving wife. Thus Rama, Vishnu's incarnation, must live
   the rest of his life without Sita.

Maryada Purushottama

   As a person, Rama personifies the characteristics of an ideal person
   (purushottama) who is to be emulated. He had within him all the
   desirable virtues that any individual would seek to aspire, and he
   fulfils all his moral obligations (maryada). Rama's purity and piety in
   his intentions and actions inspires affection and devotion for him from
   a variety of characters from different backgrounds. For example, he
   gave up his rightful claim to the throne, and agreed to go into exile
   for fourteen years, to fulfill the vow that his father had given to
   Kaikeyi, one of King Dashratha's wives. This is in spite of the fact
   that Kaikeyi's son, Bharat, begged him to return back to Ayodhya and
   said that he did not want to rule in place of Rama. But Rama considered
   his dharma as a son above that of his own birthright and his life's
   ambition. For such supreme sacrifices, and many other qualities, Shri
   Rama is considered a maryada purushottam. Some of his ideal are as
   follows:

   1. At the time when it was normal for kings to have more than one wife,
   Rama gave ideal of having a single wife. After Sita was banished, he
   was doing penace with a gold statue of Sita. In Balakanda of Valmiki
   Ramayana it is written that Rama and Sita resided in each others heart.

   2. Rama always followed his promise at any cost. Infact, he went to
   forest to make his father's promise to Kaikeyi true. There are many
   examples of Rama's promises which he kept. Most important are the
   promise to sages to save their lives from Rakshasas, getting back
   Sugreeva's kingdom, making Vibhishana the king of Lanka.

   3. Excellent friend: Rama had very touchy relations with his friends
   irrespective of their status. Some of his friends are Nishad-raj Guh,
   King of Nishaads (a caste whose profession was hunting the birds),
   Sugreeva (the Vanar king) and Vibhishana a Rakshasa.

Rama and non-violence

   Rama is always shown with a bow on his shoulder. As per valmiki
   Ramayana, Sita once told Rama that why you should always carry a bow
   with you. Sita was little upset with Rama's promise to sages that he
   will save their lives. So Sita says, 'We are in the forest and we
   should live life of sages then why this weapon'. She also narrates a
   story of an ancient sage how he became violent by accompanying a sword.
   Rama smiled and promised to Sita that he would never attack anybody
   unless the other person provokes him to do so. He life long-followed
   this. Infact he had always given two chances to his enemies Taadaka,
   Maarich, Vali and even Ravana. He even offered a peace treaty to Ravana
   before starting the war. Angada took his peace message to Ravana which
   was refused.

Companions

   Even as Rama is the ideal conception of manhood, he is often aided and
   complemented in different situations by the characteristics by those
   who accompany him. They serve Rama devotedly, at great personal risk
   and sacrifice.

Bharata and Lakshmana

   Absent when Rama is exiled, upon his return Bharata is appalled to
   learn of the events. And even though Kaikeyi had done all this for his
   benefit, Bharata is angered at the suggestion that he should take
   Ayodhya's throne. Denouncing his mother, Bharata proclaims to the city
   that he would go to the forest to fetch Rama back, and would serve out
   his term of exile himself. Although initially resentful and suspicious,
   the people of Ayodhya hail Bharata's selfless nature and courageous
   act. Despite his fervent pleas to return, Rama asserts that he must
   stay in the forest to keep his father's word. He orders Bharata to
   perform his duty as king of Ayodhya, especially important after
   Dasaratha's death, and orders Shatrughna to support and serve him.
   Returning saddened to the city, Bharata refuses to wear the crown or
   sit on the throne. Instead, he places the slippers of Rama that he had
   taken back with him on the throne, and rules Ayodhya assiduously
   keeping Rama's beliefs and values in mind. When Rama finally returns,
   Bharata runs personally to welcome him back.

   Bharata is hailed for his devotion to his elder brother and dharma,
   distinguished from Lakshmana as he is left on his own for fourteen
   years. But he unfailingly denies self-interest throughout this time,
   ruling the kingdom only in Rama's image. Vasishtha proclaims that no
   one had better learnt dharma than Bharata, and for this piety he forms
   an essential part of the conception of perfect manhood, of the Seventh
   Avatara of Vishnu. Shatrughna's role to Bharata is akin to that of
   Lakshmana to Rama. Believed to be one-quarter of Vishnu incarnated, or
   as the incarnation of his eternal companion, Ananta Sesha, Lakshmana is
   always at Rama's side. Although unconstrained by Dasaratha's promise to
   Kaikeyi, Lakshmana resists Rama's arguments and accompanies him and
   Sita into the forest. During the years of exile, Lakshmana constantly
   serves Rama and Sita - building huts, standing guard and finding new
   routes. When Sita is kidnapped, Rama blazes with his divine power and
   in his immense rage, expresses the desire to destroy all creation.
   Lakshmana prays and pleads for Rama to calm himself, and despite the
   shock of the moment and the promise of travails to come, begin an
   arduous but systematic search for Sita. During times when the search is
   proving fruitless and Rama fears for Sita, and expresses despair in his
   grief and loneliness, Lakshmana encourages him, providing hope and
   solace.

   When Rama in his despair fears that Sugriva has forgotten his promise
   to help him trace Sita, Lakshmana goes to Kishkindha where he reminds
   the complacent monarch of his promise to help. But Lakshmana also
   threatens Sugriva with destruction with his own divine, personal power,
   unable to tolerate the scene where Sugriva is enjoying material and
   sensual pleasures while Rama suffers alone. In the war, Lakshmana is
   uniquely responsible for slaying Indrajit, the invincible son of Ravana
   who had humiliated Indra and the Devas, and outwitted the brothers and
   the Vanaras on several occasions. Rishi Agastya later points out that
   this victory was the turning point of the conflict. Rama is often
   overcome with emotion and deep affection for Lakshmana, acknowledging
   how important and crucial Lakshmana's love and support was for him. He
   also trusts Lakshmana to carry out difficult orders - Lakshmana was
   asked to take Sita to the ashrama of Valmiki, where she was the spend
   her exile. Lakshmana's deep love for Rama, his unconditional service
   and sacrifice, as well as qualities of practical judgment and
   clear-headedness make him Rama's superior in certain situations and
   perspectives. Lakshmana symbolizes a man's duty to his family, brothers
   and friends, and forms an essential part of the conception of ideal
   manhood, that Rama primarily embodies.

Jatayu, Hanuman and Vibheeshana

   When Rama and Lakshmana begin the desperate search to discover where
   Sita had been taken. After traversing a distance in many directions,
   they come across the magical eagle Jatayu, who is dying. They discover
   from Jatayu that a rakshasa was flying away with a crying, struggling
   Sita towards the south. Jatayu had flown to the rescue of Sita, but
   owing to his age and the rakshasa's power, had been defeated. With
   this, Jatayu dies in Rama's arms. Rama is overcome with love and
   affection for the bird which sacrificed its own life for Sita, and the
   rage of his death returns to him in the climactic battle with Ravana.

   Rama's only allies in the struggle to find Sita are the Vanaras of
   Kishkindha. Finding a terrified Sugriva being hunted by his own
   brother, king Vali, Rama promises to kill Vali and free Sugriva of the
   terror and the unjust charge of plotting to murder Vali. The two swear
   everlasting friendship over sacred fire. Rama's natural piety and
   compassion, his sense of justice and duty, as well as his courage
   despite great personal suffering after Sita's kidnapping inspire
   devotion from the Vanaras and Sugriva, but especially Hanuman,
   Sugriva's minister. Devoted to Rama, Hanuman exerts himself greatly
   over the search for Sita. He is the first to discover that Sita was
   taken to Lanka, and volunteers to use his divine gifts in a dangerous
   reconnaissance of Lanka, where he is to verify Sita's presence. Hanuman
   hands Rama's ring to Sita, as a mark of Rama's love and his imminent
   intention of rescuing her. Though captured, he candidly delivers Rama's
   message to Ravana to immediately release Sita, and when his tail is
   burned, he flees and sets Lanka on fire. When Lakshmana is struck down
   and near death and Rama overcome with love and concern for his brother,
   Hanuman flies to the Himalayas on the urgent mission to fetch the
   sanjeevani medicinal herbs, bringing the entire mountain to Lanka so
   that no time is lost in saving Lakshmana. The Vanaras fight the
   rakshasas, completely devoted to Rama's cause. They angrily dismiss
   Ravana's efforts to create divisions by suggesting that Rama considered
   them, monkeys, as mere animals. At the end of the war, Rama worships
   Brahma, who restores life to the millions of fallen Vanaras.

   Before the onset of war, rakshasa prince Vibheeshana, Ravana's youngest
   brother comes to join Rama. Although he loves his brother and Lanka, he
   fails in repeated efforts to make Ravana follow religious values and
   return Sita. Vibheeshana believes that Ravana's arrogance and
   callousness will cause the destruction of Lanka, which is a gross
   violation of a king's duty, and that Ravana's actions have only
   propagated evil. Vibheeshana refuses to defend the evil of Ravana's
   ways and inspired by Rama's compassion and piety, leaves Lanka to join
   the Vanara Army. His knowledge of rakshasa ways and Ravana's mind help
   Rama and the Vanaras overcome black magic and mystical weapons. At the
   end of the war, Rama crowns Vibheeshana as the king of Lanka.
   Vibheeshana, and to a greater extent Hanuman, embody the perfect
   devotee in the wider conception of perfect manhood.

   The epic story of Ramayana was adopted by several cultures across Asia.
   Shown here is a Thai historic artwork depicting the battle which took
   place between Rama and Ravana.

   When Rama is sixteen years old, he and his brother Lakshmana are taken
   by Vishwamitra to the forests, with the purpose of killing rakshasas
   who are wrecking the tapasya and sacrifices of brahmins. Rama and
   Lakshmana are taught the advanced military arts and given the knowledge
   of all celestial weapons by Vishwamitra. Rama proceeds to slay
   Thatakhi, a cursed demoness. When asked to slay the yaksha demon, Rama
   demurs, considering it sinful to kill a woman. But Vishwamitra explains
   that evil has no gender. The killing of Taraka liberates the yaksha
   soul who was cursed for a sin, and had to adopt a rakshasa's body. It
   restores the purity of the sacrifices of the brahmins who live nearby,
   and protects the animals who live in the forest, and travelers. The
   main purpose of Vishwamitra's exursion is to conduct his yagna without
   interruption from two evil demons, Maricha and Subahu. Rama and
   Lakshmana guard the sacrifice, and when the two demons appear, Rama
   fires a missile that carries Maricha across the lands and into the
   ocean, but does not kill him. Rama and his brother then proceed to kill
   Subahu and accompanying demons. Rama explains to Lakshmana that leaving
   Maricha alive was an act of compassion, but the others did not heed the
   point and chose to attack. During the forest exile, sages plead for
   protection and help against evil rakshasas who spoil their sacrifices
   and religious activities and terrorize them. Many rakshasas had even
   killed and eaten sages and innocent people. At Janasthana, Rama uses
   his exceptional prowess to single-handedly kill over fourteen thousand
   demon hordes led by the powerful Khara, who is a cousin of Ravana.

Varuna

   Faced with the dilemma of how to cross the ocean, Rama performs a
   tapasya, fasting and meditating in perfect dhyana for three days and
   three nights to Varuna, the Lord of Oceans. The ocean does not respond,
   and Rama arises on the fourth morning, enraged by the God's arrogance.
   With his bow and arrow, he angrily begins attacking the oceans with
   celestial weapons - burning up the waters and killing its life and
   creatures. The Vanaras are dazzled and fearful at witnessing the
   enraged Rama demolish the oceans, and Lakshmana prays to calm Rama's
   mind. Just as Rama invokes the brahmastra, considered the most powerful
   weapon capable of destroying all creation, Varuna arises out of the
   oceans. He bows to Rama, explaining that he himself was at a loss to
   answer Rama's question. Begging him not to destroy the oceans with the
   missile, he suggests Rama re-direct the weapon at a demonic race that
   lives in the heart of the ocean. Rama's missile destroys the demons,
   and establishes a purer, liberated environment there. Varuna promises
   that he would keep the oceans still for all of Rama's army to pass, and
   Nala constructs a bridge ( Rama's Bridge) across to Lanka. Rama
   justifies his angry assault on the oceans as he followed the correct
   process of petitioning and worshipping Varuna, but obtaining the result
   by force for the greater good.

Facing Ravana

   Rama asserts his dedication to dharma when he undertakes to offer
   Ravana a final chance to make peace, despite his heinous actions and
   patronage of evil, by immediately returning Sita and apologizing to
   both Rama and Sita, but Ravana refuses. In the war, Rama slays the most
   powerful rakshasa commanders, including Prahasta, Atikaya and with
   Ravana's brother, Kumbhakarna along with hundreds of thousands of
   rakshasa soldiers. He outfights Ravana in their first battle,
   destroying his chariot and weapons, and severely injuring him, but due
   to this, he allows him to live and return to fight another day. But as
   a human being, Rama also proves vulnerable on occasion to his enemies.
   He is put to a deep sleep with Lakshmana by the nagapoosas of Indrajit,
   but they recover when Hanuman obtains the magical medicine according to
   Vibheesana's advice.

   In the grand finale of the battle, Rama engages Ravana, who through the
   devastation of losing his sons, his brothers and friends and millions
   of his warriors, arouses his awesome and magical powers and makes full
   use of the boons of Siva and Brahma, and the magical knowledge of
   warfare possessed by the greatest of rakshasas. Rama and Ravana compete
   fiercely, inflicting severe injuries on one another with the most
   powerful weapons that could destroy the universe. After a long and
   arduous battle, Rama successfully decapitates Ravana's central head,
   but an ugly head, symbolic of all of Ravana's evil powers arises in its
   place. After another long battle, Rama decapitates it, only to find
   another growing in its place. This cycle continues, and as darkness
   approaches, Ravana's magical powers increase in force. Vibheeshana,
   seeing this then tells Rama something vital. Ravana had obtained amrit,
   the nectar of immortality, from the gods. Though he could not consume
   it, he nevertheless stored a vessel of it in his stomach. This amrit
   was causing his heads to regenerate as soon as they were cut off. Upon
   the advice of Agastya, Rama worships Lord Aditya, the Sun, with the
   famous Aditya Hridayam prayer and then invokes the most powerful
   weapon, the Brahmastra. Rama fires the great missile that enters
   Ravana's chest/stomach and destroys the store of amrit, killing him
   finally. Following Ravana's death, Rama is immediately compassionate.
   After investing Vibheeshana as the next king of Lanka, he asks the new
   king and the surviving rakshasas to properly cremate their dead king,
   who he acknowledges was a great being worthy of respect and admiration,
   despite his patronage of evil.

Rama Rajya

   The end of the war coincides with the end of Rama's tenure of exile.
   Flying home on the Pushpaka Vimana, Rama returns to a joyous Ayodhya.
   His mothers, brothers and the people joyously welcome him. Kaikeyi is
   repentant of her deeds, and Rama forgives her. The next day, Rama is
   invested as the King of Ayodhya, and Emperor of the World. Although he
   first asks Lakshmana to become the yuvaraja, upon the advice of
   Lakshmana he invests the position to Bharata, who has had fourteen
   years of experience as the ruler of Ayodhya. Rama performs the holy
   Ashwamedha sacrifice, purifying and establishing religion across earth.

   Beyond the Ramayana, the eleven thousand years of Rama's rule over the
   earth represent to millions of modern Indians a time and age when God
   as a man ruled the world. There was perfect justice and freedom, peace
   and prosperity. There are no natural disasters, diseases, ailments or
   ill-fortune of any nature for any living being. There are no sins
   committed in the world by any of his people. Always attentive and
   accessible to his people, Rama is worshipped and hailed by all - the
   very symbol of moksha, the ultimate goal and destination of all life,
   and the best example of perfect character and human conduct, inspiring
   human beings for countless succeeding ages.

   Rama like other Indian kings went undercover every night to hear the
   pleas of his subjects and have a common man's perspective of his rule.
   During Rama's tenure as King, the people apparently had no locks on
   their doors as they feared no burglaries or other such misfortunes.

In myth and history

   Astronomical data in the Ramayana has been interpreted to suggest that
   his birth would have been at approximately 7323 BC (in the very early
   Treta Yuga). It is known that the Ramayana was written before the other
   great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, whose tradition of oral transmission
   is accepted to have existed around 1000 BC although there is little
   indication of when it actually began. Thus, the Ramayana may have been
   documented anywhere from around 7323 BC to conservative estimates of
   500 BC. It should be noted that Indian culture has had a tradition of
   oral transmission of knowledge, considering it sacred and confidential.
   The Ramayana is a great literary work and piece of devotional and
   philosophical literature revered by both Hindus and individuals of
   other cultures.

   Several historians interpret the epic as inspired by a real king from
   ancient northern India, who spread Vedic civilization and religious
   values across southern India by defeating powerful southern monarchs
   like Vali and Ravana. While Ravana is depicted as an evil demon in
   northern versions of the epic, different renditions from southern India
   describe Ravana as a powerful and noble monarch whose undoing was due
   to his lust and arrogance. Nevertheless, Rama is the protagonist, and
   Ravana his antagonizer.

   Be it as a manifestation of God or simply as a legendary hero of myths
   and folktales, Rama is an immensely revered and inspirational figure to
   people across the Indian subcontinent and South East Asia, as well as
   increasingly across Western civilization, where the Hindu epics and
   values are gaining recognition and popularity. In Jainism, Rama is
   enumerated among the nine white Balas. He is revered in Sikhism, and by
   the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, which regards Rama
   in the same breath as it reveres Krishna, its main inspiration.

   Rama is a great hero to the adherents of Agama Hindu Dharma and to the
   Muslims who practice Abangan, a syncretic form of Islam and Hinduism,
   in Indonesia. He is revered by the people of Thailand, Malaysia,
   Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam, who otherwise adhere to different forms
   of Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism. The Rama Leela is performed across
   South East Asia in numerous local languages and the story has been the
   subject of art, architecture, music, folk dance and sculpture. The
   ancient city of Ayutthaya stands in Thailand, as the tribute of an
   ancient Thai kingdom to the great legend. Many ancient and medieval era
   kings of South East Asia have adopted Rama as their name.

Festivals of Rama

   Rama's day and time of birth, as well as marriage to Sita are
   celebrated by Hindus across the world as Rama Navami. It falls on the
   ninth day of a Hindu lunar year, or Chaitra Masa Suklapaksha Navami.
   This day is observed as the marriage day of Rama and Sita as well as
   the birthday of Rama. People normally perform Kalyanotsavam (marriage
   celebration) for small statues of Rama and Sita in their houses and at
   the end of the day the idols are taken in a procession on the streets.
   This day also marks the end of nine day utsavam called Vasanthothsavam
   (Festival of Spring), that starts with Ugadi. Some highlights of this
   day are:
    1. Kalyanam (Ceremonial wedding performed by temple priests) at
       Bhadrachalam on the banks of the river Godavari in Khammam district
       of Andhra Pradesh.
    2. Panakam, a sweet drink prepared on this day with jaggery and
       pepper.
    3. Procession of idols in the evening that is accompanied with play of
       water and colours.
    4. For the occasion, Hindus are supposed to fast (or restrict
       themselves to a specific diet).
    5. Temples are decorated and readings of the Ramayana take place.
       Along with Rama, people also pray to Sita, Lakshmana and Hanumana.

   The occasion of victory over Ravana and the rakshasas is celebrated as
   the 10-day Vijayadashami, also known as Dussehra. The Ram Leela is
   publicly performed in many villages, towns and cities in India. Rama's
   return to Ayodhya and his coronation are celebrated as Diwali, also
   known as the Festival of Lights. The latter two are the most important
   and popular festivals in India and for Hindus across the world. In
   Malaysia, Diwali is known as Hari Deepavali, and is celebrated during
   the seventh month of the Hindu solar calendar. It is a federal public
   holiday. In many respects it resembles the traditions followed in the
   Indian subcontinent. In Nepal, Diwali is known as Tihar and celebrated
   during the October/November period. Here, though the festival is
   celebrated for five days, the traditions vary from those followed in
   India. On the first day, cows are worshipped and given offerings. On
   the second day, dogs are revered and offered special food. On the third
   day, celebrations follow the same pattern as in India, with lights and
   lamps and much social activity. On the fourth day Yama, the Lord of
   Death, is worshipped and appeased. On the fifth and final day, brothers
   sisters meet and exchange pleasantries. In Trinidad and Tobago, Diwali
   is marked as a special occasion and celebrated with a lot of fanfare.
   It is observed as a national holiday in this part of the world and some
   ministers of the Government also take part in the celebrations
   publicly.

Inspiration

   Mohandas Gandhi, the Indian spiritual and political leader was deeply
   inspired by Rama's strict adherence of satya (truth) and dharma despite
   hardship and personal travails. Gandhi was encouraged by Rama's example
   when he faced personal crises and crucial difficulties. A chapter in
   his autobiography is titled the same: Nirbal ke Bal Ram (Rama is the
   strength for the weak). When Gandhi was shot three times in the chest
   on January 30, 1948, his dying words were He Ram, He Ram. On religious
   occasions, Hindus often chant the name of Rama to express their
   devotion to God and invoke the holy. Ram Naam Jhaapo (Chant the name of
   Rama) is a popular bhajan, devotional song and a meditative mantra. In
   the ceremony of cremating the dead, Hindus often chant Ram Nam Satya
   Hai (Rama's name is Truth).

Mode of education in Ramayana's time

   Story telling was definitely a mode of education in Ramayana's time.
   The Baalkanda of Valmiki Ramayan is full of stories. Rama and Lakshmana
   were told numerous stories by Vishwamitra. These stories of Shiva,
   Ganga, Kartikeya, Indra, Samudra-Manthan were supposedly from puranas.
   In Ramayana, if one wants to convince something to other he takes help
   of stories. Sita is found telling story to Rama and to Hanuman in
   Lanka. Many sages came to meet Rama in uttarKaanda. They tell many
   valuable stories to Rama and people of Ayodhya.
