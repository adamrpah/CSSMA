Become an SOS Friend - Direct Debit


   Thank you for taking a moment to complete this simple form, and for
   helping us help orphaned and abandoned children around the world.

   The minimum donation for an SOS friend is £10/month. If you cannot
   afford this, please use this link to making a smaller regular donation.

   All the normal Direct Debit safeguards and guarantees apply. No changes
   in the amount, date or frequency to be debited can be made without
   notifying you at least 10 working days in advance of your accounts
   being debited. In the event of any error, you are entitled to an
   immediate refund from your Bank or Building Society. You have the right
   to cancel a Direct Debit Instruction at any time simply by writing to
   your Bank or Building Society, with a copy to us.

   Any questions?
