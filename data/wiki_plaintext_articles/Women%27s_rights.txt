   The term women’s rights typically refers to freedoms inherently
   possessed by women and girls of all ages, which may be
   institutionalized or ignored and/or illegitimately suppressed by law or
   custom in a particular society. These liberties are grouped together
   and differentiated from broader notions of human rights because they
   often differ from the freedoms inherently possessed by and/or
   recognized for men and boys, and because activism surrounding this
   issue claims an inherent historical and traditional bias against the
   exercise of rights by women.

   Feminism and most modern sociological theory maintain that the
   differences between men and women are, at least in part, socially
   constructed 'differences' , (i.e. determined through history by
   specific human groups), rather than biologically determined, immutable
   conditions. See articles about women, the term some feminists see as a
   "gender unbiased term."

   Issues commonly associated with notions of women's rights include,
   though are not limited to:
     * The right to bodily integrity and autonomy,
     * The right to vote,
     * The right to hold public office,
     * The right to work,
     * The right to fair wages,
     * The right to own property,
     * The right to education,
     * Marital rights,
     * Parental rights,
     * Religious rights,
     * The right to serve in the military, and
     * The right to enter into legal contracts.
