   Location of Bissau in Guinea-Bissau

   Bissau, estimated population 355,000 (2004), is the capital of
   Guinea-Bissau. The city is located on the Geba River estuary, off the
   Atlantic Ocean. It is the country's largest city, major port, and
   administrative and military centre. Peanuts, hardwoods, copra, palm
   oil, and rubber are the chief products. The city was founded in 1687 by
   Portugal as a fortified port and trading centre. In 1942 it became the
   capital of Portuguese Guinea but was replaced by Madina do Boe in 1973-
   74. Bissau is located at 11°52' North, 15°36' West (11.86667, -15.60).

   The city is known for its annual carnival. Other attractions include
   the Fortaleza d'Amura barracks containing Amílcar Cabral's mausoleum,
   the Pidjiguiti Memorial to the dockers killed in the Bissau Dockers'
   Strike on August 3, 1959, the Guinea-Bissau National Arts Institute,
   Bissau New Stadium and local beaches. Many buildings in the city were
   ruined during the Guinea-Bissau Civil War, including the Guinea-Bissau
   Presidential Palace and the Bissau French Cultural Centre (now
   rebuilt), and the city centre is still underdeveloped.

   The airport that serves Bissau is Osvaldo Vieira International Airport.
