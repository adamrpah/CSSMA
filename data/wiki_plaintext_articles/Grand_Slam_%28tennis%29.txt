Grand Slam (tennis)

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Sports events

   In tennis, a singles player or doubles team that wins all four Grand
   Slam titles in the same year is said to have achieved the Grand Slam or
   a Calendar Year Grand Slam. If the player or team wins all four
   consecutively, but not in the same calendar year, it is called a
   Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam.

   The four Grand Slam tournaments are the most important tennis events of
   the year in terms of world ranking points, tradition, prize-money
   awarded, and public attention. They are:
     * Australian Open
     * French Open
     * Wimbledon
     * U.S. Open

History

   The term Grand Slam, as applied to tennis, was first used by New York
   Times columnist John Kieran according to Total Tennis, The Ultimate
   Tennis Encyclopedia by Bud Collins. In the chapter about 1933, Collins
   writes that after the Australian player Jack Crawford had won the
   Australian, French, and Wimbledon Championships, speculation arose
   about his chances in the U.S. Championships. Kieran, who was a bridge
   player, wrote: "If Crawford wins, it would be something like scoring a
   grand slam on the courts, doubled and vulnerable." Crawford, an
   asthmatic, won two of the first three sets of his finals match against
   Fred Perry, then tired in the heat and lost the last two sets and the
   match.

   The expression Grand Slam, initially used to describe the winning of
   the tennis major events in one calendar year, was later incorporated by
   other sports, notably golf, to describe a similar accomplishment.

Calendar Year Grand Slam (four majors in one calendar year)

Men's Singles

     * Don Budge ( 1938)

     * Maureen Connolly ( 1953)
     * Margaret Smith Court ( 1970)
     * Steffi Graf ( 1988)

       Championships, then Darlene Hard at the French Championships,
       Wimbledon, and the U.S. Championships.

Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam (four consecutive majors regardless of year)

   Though the term was originally defined as winning all four tournaments
   in the same calendar year, the International Tennis Federation (ITF)
   declared the official term as a player holding all four titles
   simultaneously, regardless of the calendar year. After Martina
   Navrátilová won four consecutive major championships, holding all four
   at once, the ITF awarded her the Grand Slam US$1 million bonus, as she
   held all four titles at once. Bud Collins sarcastically called her
   accomplishment the "Grand Snap" because Playtex was the sponsor of the
   bonus.
     * Martina Navrátilová ( 1983- 84)
          + Note: Won six consecutive Grand Slam titles. Her streak was
            Wimbledon, U.S. Open, and Australian Open in 1983, followed by
            French Open, Wimbledon, and U.S. Open in 1984. The Australian
            Open was held in December from 1977 through 1985, returning to
            its original January date in 1987.
     * Steffi Graf ( 1993- 94)
          + Note: Graf also won a Calendar Year Grand Slam in 1988.
     * Serena Williams ( 2002- 03)
          + Note: The " Serena Slam" — a reference to the Tiger Slam won
            by Tiger Woods between 2000 and 2001.

   In doubles:
     * Gigi Fernandez & Natasha Zvereva ( 1992- 93)

   Helen Wills Moody won all 16 of the Grand Slam singles tournaments she
   played beginning with the 1924 U.S. Championships and extending through
   the 1933 Wimbledon Championships (not counting her defaults in the 1926
   French and Wimbledon Championships). The first 15 of those were won
   without losing a set. During this period, she won 6 Wimbledons, 4
   French Championships, and 6 U.S. Championships. She also won the 1924
   Summer Olympics during this period. Moody never entered the Australian
   Championships.

Career Grand Slam

   Winning all four Grand Slam tournaments during a career is termed a
   "Career Grand Slam." (The players who won all four Grand Slam
   tournaments during a single calendar year are also listed elsewhere in
   this article.) A number of players have failed to achieve the Career
   Grand Slam because they did not have long careers or because a
   particular tournament was ill-suited to the player's game. Ken
   Rosewall, Guillermo Vilas, Ivan Lendl, and Mats Wilander failed to win
   Wimbledon, while John Newcombe, Jimmy Connors, Boris Becker, Stefan
   Edberg, and Pete Sampras failed to win the French Open.

   The following lists the players who won all four Grand Slam singles
   tournaments during their careers. (The year in which they won their
   first Grand Slam singles tournament is listed first. The years in which
   the tournaments needed to complete the Career Grand Slam were won are

Calendar Year Golden Slam

   The Golden Slam, or Golden Grand Slam, is a term created in 1988 when
   Steffi Graf won all four Grand Slam tournaments and the gold medal in
   tennis at the Summer Olympics in the same calendar year.

   Tennis was not an Olympic medal sport between 1924 and 1988, or even
   considered important by the top players until a a few years ago;
   therefore, many tennis players never participated in the Olympics.

Career Golden Slam

   A player who wins all four Grand Slam tournaments and the Olympic gold
   medal during the player's career has achieved a Career Golden Slam.

The career "Boxed Set"

   Another imaginable Grand Slam-related accomplishment is winning a
   "boxed set" of Grand Slam titles – winning the singles, doubles, and
   mixed doubles at all four Grand Slam events.

   The top men's singles players have played comparatively little doubles,
   and very little mixed doubles. Three women have completed the "boxed
   set" during their careers:
     * Doris Hart
     * Margaret Smith Court
     * Martina Navrátilová

   Serena Williams has come closer than any other currently active player
   to joining this elite group. She has yet to win the mixed doubles at
   the Australian and French opens (finishing as the runner-up at the 1998
   Australian Open).
