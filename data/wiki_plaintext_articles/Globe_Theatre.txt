   The Globe Theatre normally refers to one of three theatres in London
   associated with William Shakespeare. These are:
    1. The original Globe Theatre, built in 1599 by the playing company to
       which Shakespeare belonged, and destroyed by fire on June 29, 1613.
    2. The Globe Theatre was rebuilt by June, 1614 and closed in 1642.
    3. A modern reconstruction of the original Globe, named "Shakespeare's
       Globe Theatre" or the "New Globe Theatre," opened in 1997.

The original Globe

   The original Globe was an Elizabethan theatre which opened in Autumn
   1599 in Southwark, on the south bank of the Thames, in an area now
   known as Bankside. It was one of several major theatres that were
   located in the area, the others being the Swan, the Rose and The Hope.
   The Globe was the principal playhouse of the Lord Chamberlain's Men
   (who would become the King's Men in 1603). Most of Shakespeare's
   post-1599 plays were staged at the Globe, including Julius Caesar,
   Macbeth, Othello, King Lear and Hamlet

   The Globe was owned by many actors, who (except for one) were also
   shareholders in the Lord Chamberlain's Men. Two of the six Globe
   shareholders, Richard Burbage and his brother Cuthbert Burbage, owned
   double shares of the whole, or 25% each; the other four men,
   Shakespeare, John Heminges, Augustine Phillips, and Thomas Pope, owned
   a single share, or 12.5%. (Originally William Kempe was intended to be
   the seventh partner, but he sold out his share to the four minority
   sharers, leaving them with more than the originally planned 10%). These
   initial proportions changed over time, as new sharers were added.
   Shakespeare's share diminished from 1/8 to 1/14, or roughly 7%, over
   the course of his career.

   The Globe was built in 1599 using timber from an earlier theatre, The
   Theatre, that had been built by Richard Burbage's father, James
   Burbage, in Shoreditch in 1576. The Burbages originally had a 20-year
   lease of the site on which the Theatre was built. When the lease ran
   out, they dismantled The Theatre beam by beam and transported it over
   the Thames to reconstruct it as The Globe.

   On June 29, 1613, the Globe Theatre went up in flames during a
   performance of Henry the Eighth. A theatrical cannon, set off during
   the performance, misfired, igniting the wooden beams and thatching.
   According to one of the few surviving documents of the event, no one
   was hurt except a man who put out his burning breeches with a bottle of
   ale.

   Like all the other theatres in London, the Globe was closed down by the
   Puritans in 1642. It was destroyed in 1644 to make room for tenements.
   Its exact location remained unknown until remnants of its foundations
   were discovered in 1989 beneath Anchor Terrace on Park Street. There
   may be further remains beneath Anchor Terrace, but the 18th century
   terrace is listed and may not be disturbed by archaeologists.

Layout of the Globe

   The Globe's shape and size have been pieced together by scholarly
   inquiry over the last two centuries. The evidence suggests that it was
   a three-story, 100-foot (30.5m) wide, open-air amphitheatre that could
   house around 3,000 spectators. The Globe is shown as a round building
   on a contemporary engraving of London. On this basis, some assume the
   building was circular, while others favour a polygonal shape.
   Archaeological evidence suggests the playhouse had twenty sides.

   At the base of the stage, there was an area called the pit, (or,
   harking back to the old inn-yards, yard) where, for a penny, people
   (the "groundlings") would stand to watch the performance. Groundlings
   would stand and eat hazelnuts during performances — during the
   excavation of the Globe nutshells were found preserved in the dirt — or
   oranges. Around the yard were three levels of seating, which were more
   expensive than standing: the first two were called the Twopenny Rooms
   and the top level was called the Penny Gallery.

   A rectangular stage platform, also known as an 'apron stage', thrust
   out into the middle of the open-air yard. The stage measured about 43
   feet (13.1m) in width, 27 feet (8.2m) in depth and was raised about 5
   feet (1.52m) off the ground. On this stage, there was a trap door for
   use by performers to enter from the "cellarage" area beneath the stage.
   There may have been as many as four smaller trap doors around the
   stage. Often the area beneath the stage is also called "hell," since
   supernatural beings (such as the ghost in Hamlet) enter and exit the
   stage from this area.

   Large columns on either side of the stage supported a roof over the
   rear portion of the stage. This ceiling was called the "heavens," and
   was probably painted with images of the sky. A trap door in the heavens
   enabled performers to "fly" or descend using some form of rope and
   harness.

   The back wall of the stage had three doors on the first floor and a
   balcony on the second. The doors entered into the "tiring house"
   (backstage area) where the actors dressed and awaited their entrances.
   The balcony housed the musicians and could also be used for scenes
   requiring an upper space, such as the balcony scene in Romeo and
   Juliet. In addition, it could be used as the " Lord's Room," where
   higher-paying audience members could pay to be seated – more to be seen
   than to see the play, since they would have been behind the performers.

The modern Globe

   At the instigation of Sam Wanamaker, a new Globe theatre was built
   according to an Elizabethan plan. The design team comprised Theo Crosby
   of Pentagram as the architect, Buro Happold as structural and services
   engineers and Boyden & Co as quantity surveyors. It opened in 1997
   under the name "Shakespeare's Globe Theatre" and now stages plays every
   summer (May to October). Mark Rylance was appointed as the first
   artistic director of the modern Globe in 1995. In 2006, Dominic
   Dromgoole took over.

   The new theatre is 200 yards (183m) from the original site, and was the
   first thatched roof building permitted in London since the Great Fire
   of London in 1666.

   As in the original Globe, the theatre is open to the sky and has a
   thrust stage that projects into a large circular yard surrounded by
   three tiers of steeply raked seating. 600 tickets to stand (and you
   must stand, no sitting allowed) in the yard are available for every
   performance at 5 pounds each. The only covered parts of the
   amphitheatre are the stage and the (more expensive) seated areas. Plays
   are put on during the summer, usually between May and the first week of
   October. In the winter the theatre is used for educational purposes.
   Tours are available all year round.

   The reconstruction was carefully researched so that the new building
   would be as faithful a replica as possible. This was aided by the
   discovery as final plans were being made of the site of the original
   Globe itself. Modernisations include the addition of sprinklers on the
   roof to protect against fire, and the fact that the theatre is partly
   joined onto a modern lobby, visitors centre and additional backstage
   support areas. Due to modern Health and Safety regulations 1,500 people
   can be housed during a show, half the estimated 3,000 of Shakespeare's
   time.
