   São Tomé ( population 53,300 in 2003) is the capital city of São Tomé
   and Príncipe and is by far the nation's largest town. It was founded by
   Portugal in 1485 and is centred on a sixteenth century cathedral.
   Another early building is Fort São Sebastião, built in 1575 and now the
   São Tomé National Museum. In 1599, the city as well as the islands were
   taken by the Dutch for two days and again in 1641 for a year. It was
   the then colony's capital until 1753 and has been the national capital
   continuously since 1852. Its name is Portuguese for " Saint Thomas."
   São Tomé is located at 0°20' North, 6°44' East (0.333, 6.7333). .

   Features of the town include the Presidential Palace, the Fisherman's
   Church, and a cinema. The city is also home to two markets, a radio
   station, a hospital, and an international airport. São Tomé also serves
   as the centre of the island's road and bus networks. The town is well
   known for the Tchiloli play.

   Important as a port, São Tomé lies on Ana Chaves Bay in the north east
   of São Tomé Island. Cabras Island lies in the bay.

   São Tomé is located northeast of Trindade, southeast of Guadalupe and
   northwest of Santana. It is linked to these towns by various roadways,
   but especially by the highway encircling the entire island of São Tomé.
