   Portsmouth is a city of about 189,000 people located in the county of
   Hampshire on the southern coast of England. The administrative unit
   itself forms part of the wider Portsmouth conurbation, with an
   estimated population of 442,252 residents within its boundaries, making
   it the 11th largest urban area in England. A significant naval port for
   centuries, it is home to the world's oldest dry dock still in use and
   to many famous ships.

   Portsmouth has declined as a military port in recent years but remains
   a major dockyard and base for the Royal Navy. There is a commercial
   port serving destinations on the continent for freight and passenger
   traffic.

   The Portsmouth Urban Area covers an area with a population well over
   twice that of the city of Portsmouth itself, and includes Southsea,
   Fareham, Portchester, Gosport, Havant (which includes the large suburb
   Leigh Park), Lee-on-the-Solent, Stubbington and Waterlooville.

History

Early history of the area

   Although there have been settlements in the area since before Roman
   times, mostly being offshoots of Portchester, Portsmouth is commonly
   regarded as having been founded in 1180 by John of Gisors ( Jean de
   Gisors). Most early records of Portsmouth are thought to have been
   destroyed by Norman invaders following the Norman Conquest. The
   earliest detailed references to Portsmouth can be found in the
   Southwick Cartularies. However the Oxford Dictionary of British Place
   Names gives the name "Portesmuthan" as late 9th century, meaning "mouth
   of the harbour called Port" (from Latin portus).

   In the Domesday survey there is no mention of Portsmouth. However
   settlements that later went on to form part of Portsmouth are listed.
   These are Buckland, Copnor, Fratton on Portsea Island and Cosham,
   Wymering, Drayton and Farlington on the mainland. At this time it is
   estimated the Portsmouth area had a population not greater than two or
   three hundred.

   While in the primary diocese of Portsea there was a small church prior
   to 1166 (now St Mary's in Fratton) Portsmouth's first real church came
   into being in 1181 when John of Gisors granted an acre (4,000 m²) of
   land to Augustinian monks at the Southwick Priory to build a chapel
   dedicated to Thomas Becket. This chapel continued to be run by the
   monks of Southwick Priory until the Reformation after which its
   possession was transferred to Winchester College. The modern Portsmouth
   Anglican Cathedral is built on the original location of the chapel.

Growth of the city

   In 1194, after King Richard I (the Lionheart) returned from being held
   captive by Duke Leopold V of Austria, Richard set about summoning a
   fleet and an army to Portsmouth, which Richard had taken over from John
   of Gisors. On May 2, 1194 King Richard I gave Portsmouth its first
   Royal Charter granting permission for the city to hold a fifteen day
   annual fair (which became known as the Free Market Fair), weekly
   markets (on Thursdays), to set up a local court to deal with minor
   matters, and exemption from paying the annual tax ("farm") of £18 a
   year--instead the money would be used for local matters. The actual
   physical charter was handed over by the Bishop of Ely William de
   Longchamps. The present location of the charter is currently unknown
   but its text survives, as when later royal charters were granted to the
   city reaffirming and extending its privileges large parts of the
   original charter were quoted verbatim.

   As a crescent and an eight-point star (as appear on the city coat of
   arms) were to be found on both the seals of King Richard and William de
   Longchamps it is commonly thought that this may have been the source of
   them, although there is no known documentary evidence for this.

   King Richard later went on to build a number of houses and a hall in
   Portsmouth, the hall is thought to have been at the current location of
   the Clarence Barracks (the area was previously known as Kingshall
   Green).

   In 1200 King John issued another charter to Portsmouth reaffirming the
   rights and privileges awarded by King Richard. King John's desire to
   invade Normandy resulted in the establishment of Portsmouth as a
   permanent naval base.

   In 1212 William of Wrotham (Archdeacon of Taunton, Keeper of the King's
   Ships) started constructing the first docks of Portsmouth. At about the
   same time Pierre des Roches (Bishop of Winchester) founded Domus Dei
   (Hospital of St Nicholas) which performed its duties as an almshouse
   and hospice until 1540 when like other religious buildings it was
   seized by King Henry VIII).

   During the thirteenth century Portsmouth was commonly used by King
   Henry III and Edward I as a base for attacks against France.

   By the fourteenth century commercial interests had grown considerably,
   despite rivalry with the dockyard of nearby Southampton. Common imports
   included wool, grain, wheat, woad, wax and iron, however the ports
   largest trade was in wine from Bayonne and Bordeaux.

War with France

   In 1338 a French fleet led by Nicholas Behuchet arrived at Portsmouth
   docks flying English flags before anyone realised that they were a
   hostile force. The French burnt down most of the buildings in the town
   and many of the population were raped and slaughtered, only the local
   church and Domus Dei survived. As a result of this King Edward III gave
   the remaining townsfolk exemption from national taxes so that they
   could afford to rebuild the town.

   Only ten years after this devastation the town for the first time was
   struck by the plague known as the Black Death. In order to prevent the
   regrowth of Portsmouth as a threat the French again sacked the city in
   1369, 1377 and 1380.

   King Henry V was the first king to decide to build permanent
   fortification in Portsmouth. In 1418 he ordered a wooden Round Tower be
   built at the mouth of the harbour, which was completed in 1426. However
   it wasn't until the Tudor dynasty that Portsmouth's defence was
   seriously dealt with. Under King Henry VIII the Round Tower was rebuilt
   out of stone and a Square Tower was raised. It was at this time that
   Robert Brygandine and Sir Reginald Bray, with the support of the king,
   commenced the building in Portsmouth of the country's first dry dock.
   In 1527 with some of the money obtained from the dissolution of the
   monasteries Henry VIII built the fort which became known as Southsea
   Castle. In 1545, he saw his vice- flagship Mary Rose founder off
   Southsea Castle, with a loss of about 500 lives, while going into
   action against the French fleet.

   Over the years Portsmouth's fortification was increased by numerous
   monarchs including King Henry VII and Queen Elizabeth I, although most
   of these have now been converted into tourist attractions.

   On December 21, 1872 a major scientific expedition, the Challenger
   expedition, was launched from Portsmouth.

20th century

   In 1904 the boundaries of Portsmouth were extended to finally include
   the whole of Portsea Island. The boundaries were further extended in
   1920 and 1932, taking in areas of the mainland.

   The city was bombed extensively during WW2, destroying many houses and
   the Guildhall. While most of the city has since been rebuilt,
   developers still occasionally find unexploded bombs.

   Southsea beach and Portsmouth Harbour were military embarkation points
   for the D-Day landings on June 6th 1944. Southwick House, just to the
   north of Portsmouth, had been chosen as the headquarters for the
   Supreme Allied Commander, General Eisenhower during D-Day.

   After the war, much of the city's housing stock was damaged and more
   was cleared in an attempt to improve the quality of housing. Those
   people affected by this were moved out from the centre of the city to
   new developments such as Paulsgrove and Leigh Park.

21st century

   In 2003, erection was started of a 170 metre high Spinnaker Tower sited
   at Portsmouth Harbour, and celebrating the city's maritime tradition.
   Completed in 2005, the tower has twin concrete legs meeting at half
   height to form a single column from which steel sails are mounted; an
   observation deck at the top provides a view of the city and harbour for
   tourists.

   In late 2004, Tricorn Centre, dubbed "The ugliest building in the UK"
   was finally demolished after years of delay and wrangling over the cost
   of doing so and the controversy as to whether it was worth preserving
   as an example of sixties Brutalist architecture.

   In 2005, Portsmouth was a focus for Sea Britain, a series of events to
   mark the 200th anniversary ( bicentenary) of Lord Nelson's victory at
   the Battle of Trafalgar. In particular, in June, there was the massive
   Fleet Review, by HM Queen Elizabeth II and a mock battle ( son et
   lumière) that evening, after dark.

   Most of the city of Portsmouth lies on Portsea Island, located where
   the Solent joins the English Channel. This makes Portsmouth the United
   Kingdom's only island city and one of the most densely populated places
   in Europe. The island is separated from the mainland to the north by a
   narrow creek, bridged in places to make it - in appearance - a
   peninsula. The sheltered Portsmouth Harbour lies to the west of the
   island and the large tidal bay of Langstone Harbour is to the east.
   Portsdown Hill dominates the skyline to the north, providing a
   magnificent panoramic view over the city, and to the south are the
   waters of the Solent with the Isle of Wight beyond. Being a seaside
   city, it is low-lying -- majority of its surface area less than 3
   metres above sea level.

   The city includes the following districts on the island:
     * Baffins
     * Buckland
     * Copnor
     * Eastney
     * Fratton
     * Hilsea
     * Kingston
     * Landport
     * Milton
     * North End
     * Old Portsmouth
     * Portsea
     * Rudmore
     * Somerstown
     * Southsea
     * Stamshaw
     * Tipner

   And these districts on the mainland:
     * Cosham
     * Drayton
     * Farlington
     * Paulsgrove
     * Widley (a small part of)
     * Wymering

Education

Higher and further education

   The city has one university, the University of Portsmouth (previously
   Portsmouth Polytechnic), but several local colleges also have the power
   to award HNDs.

   Local further education colleges include Highbury College, the largest,
   which specializes in vocational education and Portsmouth College, which
   offers a mixture of academic and vocational courses in the city.
   Additionally there is South Downs College and Havant College, both of
   which offer a range of academic and vocational courses available just
   outside the city.

Secondary education

   Local secondary schools are Admiral Lord Nelson School, City of
   Portsmouth Girls' School, King Richard School, Mayfield School, Milton
   Cross School, Priory School, Springfield School, St Edmund's RC School,
   St Luke's CofE VA Secondary School and City of Portsmouth Boys' School.

   Independent schools include the Portsmouth Grammar School, Mayville
   High School, Portsmouth High School and St John's College.

   Both Admiral Lord Nelson School and Milton Cross School were built
   recently to meet the demand of a growing young population.

Government

   The city is administered by Portsmouth City Council, which is currently
   a unitary authority. Until April 1, 1997 it was a non-metropolitan
   district of Hampshire. Portsmouth remains part of the Ceremonial county
   of Hampshire.

   The city council is made up of 42 councillors. These are returned from
   14 wards, each ward having three councillors. The wards are Baffins,
   Central Southsea, Charles Dickens, Copnor, Cosham, Drayton and
   Farlington, Eastney and Craneswater, Fratton, Hilsea, Milton, Nelson,
   Paulsgrove, St. Jude and finally St. Thomas. Where a ward is named
   after an area of the city, it will also include parts not considered
   part of the traditional area.

Shopping

   In the last decade the number of shops in Portsmouth has grown
   dramatically due to both the buoyancy of the local economy and improved
   transport links.

   Shopping areas in the city include:
     * Ocean Retail Park is an out-of-town shopping area located on the
       north eastern side of Portsea Island off the A2030 leading to the
       A27. It is close to the site of the old Portsmouth Airport that
       closed in 1973. The retail park is composed of shops requiring
       large floor space for selling consumer goods (furniture, electrical
       goods, computers).

     * Cascades Shopping Centre an indoor shopping centre built in the
       early nineties with approximately 75 shops covering a wide range of
       goods.

     * Commercial Road running alongside the Cascades shopping centre this
       area contains approximately a further 50 shops, located near
       Portsmouth & Southsea train station.

     * Gunwharf Quays a new shopping area which opened in 2001 consists of
       85 mainly upmarket fashion stores, restaurants and a Vue
       multi-screen cinema, located near Portsmouth Harbour train station
       and the Hard Bus Interchange, and a relatively short walk from
       Commercial Road.

     * Bridge Centre a 11,043 square metre shopping centre built in 1988,
       now dominated by the newly built Asda Walmart store.

     * The Historic Dockyard has several shops of interest, selling mainly
       goods with a nautical theme and with Victory or Mary Rose
       connotations. It also has a French Market, several times per year
       and a Christmas Market each year, in the lead-up to Christmas.

   Other shopping areas with more than twenty shops include North End,
   Fratton Road, Palmerston Road, Elm Grove/Albert Road, and Cosham High
   Street.

   Portsmouth is considered by some to be a clone town, particularly the
   town centre.

Sport

   The city is home to Portsmouth F.C., who play their home games at
   Fratton Park. Having secured planning permission, the club are in the
   process of building a new stadium on the same site.

   Locks Sailing Club at Longshore way is the city's premier dinghy
   sailing club. Portsmouth Rugby Football Club play their home games in
   the London Division at Rugby Camp, Hilsea.

   The city's rowing club is located in Southsea at the Seafront near the
   Hovercraft Terminal.

Tourist Attractions

   Most of Portsmouth's tourist attractions are related to its naval
   history. In the last decade Portsmouth's Historic Dockyard has been
   given a much needed face-lift. Among the attractions are the D-Day
   museum (which holds the Overlord embroidery) and, in the dockyard, HMS
   Victory, the remains of the Mary Rose raised from the sea-bed in recent
   years, HMS Warrior and the Royal Naval Museum.

   The millennium project to build the Spinnaker Tower at Gunwharf Quays
   was completed in 2005. The tower is 170 m tall, features viewing decks
   at sea level, 100 m, 105 m, and 110 m.

   Other tourist attractions include the birthplace of Charles Dickens,
   the Blue Reef Aquarium (formerly Sea Life Centre), Cumberland House (a
   natural history museum), and Southsea castle.

Places of worship

   St John's Cathedral
   Enlarge
   St John's Cathedral

   Portsmouth is almost unique among British cities in having two
   cathedrals; the Anglican Cathedral of St Thomas, in Old Portsmouth, and
   the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St John the Evangelist, in Edinburgh
   Road, Portsea. The historic reason for this is that when Catholics were
   permitted to re-establish cathedrals in the UK in the nineteenth
   century, they were only allowed to do so in places without an existing
   Church of England cathedral, e.g. Birmingham, Arundel, Southwark,
   Westminster and Salford. This restriction has now been abolished, as at
   Liverpool and Bristol (Clifton). Portsmouth's Catholic cathedral was
   consecrated in 1882. Later, when Portsmouth was raised to city status
   in 1926, St Thomas' Church was also raised to cathedral status. When St
   Mary's Church, Portsea, was rebuilt in Victorian times, it had been
   envisaged that it might be the cathedral if city status was achieved,
   but St Thomas' was given the honour because of its historic status.
   Another historic Old Portsmouth church, the Garrison Church, was bombed
   during the war and the nave has been left roofless as a memorial. There
   are numerous other active churches and places of worship throughout the
   city (see links at end for some websites).

Transport and communications

   The city has several mainline railway stations, on a direct route to
   London. Portsmouth's stations are (in order, out of the city):
   Portsmouth Harbour, Portsmouth & Southsea, Fratton, Hilsea and Cosham.

   Portsmouth Harbour has passenger ferry links to Gosport and the Isle of
   Wight. A car ferry service to the Isle of Wight operated by Wightlink
   is nearby. Britain's longest-standing commercial hovercraft service,
   begun in the 1960's, still runs from near Clarence Pier to Ryde, Isle
   of Wight, operated by Hovertravel.

   Local Bus services are provided by First in Hampshire & Dorset and
   Stagecoach serving the City of Portsmouth and the surroundings of
   Havant, Leigh Park, Waterlooville, Fareham and long distance service
   700 to Chichester, Worthing and Brighton

   There are three road links to the mainland. These are the M275, A3
   (London Road) and A2030 (Eastern Road).

   Portsmouth Continental Ferry Port has links to Caen,
   Cherbourg-Octeville, St Malo and Le Havre in France, Bilbao in Spain
   and the Channel Islands. Ferry services from the port are operated by
   Brittany Ferries, P&O Ferries, Condor Ferries and LD Lines. On 18 May
   2006 Acciona Trasmediterranea started a service to Bilbao in
   competition with P&O’s existing service. This service got off to a bad
   start when the ferry 'Fortuny' was detained in Portsmouth by the MCA
   for numerous safety breaches. The faults were quickly corrected by
   Acciona and the service took its first passengers from Portsmouth on
   the 25 May 2006. The port is the second busiest ferry port in the UK
   after Dover handling around 3 million passengers a year and has direct
   access to the M275.

   There is an ongoing debate on the development of public transport
   structure, with monorails and light rail both being considered. A light
   rail link to Gosport has been authorised but is unlikely to go ahead
   following the refusal of funding by the Department for Transport in
   November 2005. The monorail scheme is unlikely to proceed following the
   withdrawal of official support for the proposal by Portsmouth City
   Council, after the development's promoters failed to progress the
   scheme to agreed timetables.

   The telephone area code for Portsmouth is 023 followed by an eight
   digit number (usually beginning with 92), and was previously (01705),
   and before that (0705).

Future developments

   Development at Gunwharf Quays will continue until 2007 with the
   completion of Portsmouths tallest building at 29 storeys East Side
   Plaza. Development of the former Brickwood brewery site, now under way,
   will include a 22 storey tower know as the Admiralty Quarter Tower.

   Portsmouth's regeneration is being continued in the city centre with
   the controversial demolition of the Tricorn Centre, a long abandoned
   shopping mall and car park, described as a "concrete monstrosity".

   The site is due to be transformed by 2010 to include shops, cafés and
   restaurants, a four-star 150-bed hotel, 200 residential apartments, and
   a 2,300-space car park.

   The rebuilding of Fratton Park, home to Portsmouth Football Club is set
   to hold 35,000 fans. The stadium will be built to allow Portsmouth to
   compete successfully in the English Football's Premier League. Along
   with the stadium, 500 houses will be built in a development called
   Pompey Village.

   These plans have been superseded by plans to build a 40,000+ capacity
   stadium. The club is currently in negociations with Portsmouth City
   Counicl to try to find another site with better road access and more
   space for other development. Possible locations are:
    1. King George V playing fields - Cosham,
    2. St Johns playing fields - Farlington,
    3. Tipner,
    4. Fratton Park
