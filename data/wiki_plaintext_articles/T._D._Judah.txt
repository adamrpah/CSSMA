   T.D. Judah was the name of a 4-2-2 steam locomotive owned by the
   Central Pacific Railroad. It was named in honour of the railroad's
   first chief engineer, Theodore Dehone Judah, who surveyed a passable
   route over the Sierra Nevada Mountains for the Transcontinental
   Railroad.

History and career

   Like its sister engine, C.P. Huntington, T.D. Judah was originally
   built by the Cooke Locomotive Works in early 1863 for a railroad that
   was unable to pay for it. Later, the two were seen in the Cooke shops
   by Collis Huntington and purchased for use on the Central Pacific
   Railroad (CP), becoming the road's third and fourth locomotives
   respectively. Two other, larger engines, Gov. Stanford (number 1, built
   by Norris Locomotive Works) and Pacific (number 2, built by Mason
   Machine Works) had been purchased earlier.

   Having originally been a 4-2-4T (T for tank), in 1872, the engine was
   rebuilt as a 4-2-2 with separate tender and may have been given other
   mechanical upgrades like its sister engine. The rebuild reduced the
   locomotive's overall weight to 30,000 lb., with 15,000 lb. on the
   drivers.

   T.D. Judah was sold to the Wellington Colliery Company on Vancouver
   Island, British Columbia, Canada, where it found service as Wellington
   Colliery Railway's Queen Anne. It was subsequently scrapped in 1912.
