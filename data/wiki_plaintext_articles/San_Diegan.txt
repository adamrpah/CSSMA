   The southbound San Diegan passes through San Clemente, California in
   April, 1973.

   The San Diegan was one of the named passenger trains of the Atchison,
   Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and a " workhorse" of the railroad. Its
   126- mile (203- kilometer) route ran from Los Angeles, California south
   to San Diego. It was assigned train Nos. 70–79 (Nos. 80–83 were added
   in 1952 when RDCs began operating on the line).

   The Los Angeles-San Diego corridor (popularly known as the " Surf Line"
   — officially, the Fourth District of the Los Angeles Division) was to
   the Santa Fe as the New York–Philadelphia corridor was to the
   Pennsylvania Railroad. Daily traffic could reach a density of ten
   trains (each way) during the summer months. The first San Diegan ran on
   March 27, 1938 as one set of equipment making two round trips each way.

   A second trainset delivered in 1941 made possible four streamlined
   trains each way. In addition, a third set of heavyweight equipment made
   a fifth trip in each direction. During and after the Second World War,
   furlough business from San Diego's military bases necessitated extra
   (albeit heavyweight) sections of San Diegans, and racetrack specials to
   Del Mar added to passenger train miles.

   Amtrak continued to operate the San Diegan when it took over operation
   of the nation's passenger service on May 1, 1971, and it retired the
   name on June 1, 2001. Today the route of the San Diegan (the second
   busiest rail line in the United States) is served by Amtrak's Pacific
   Surfliner.

History

Timeline

     * October 12, 1880: The California Southern Railroad Company is
       officially organized. Initial plans are made to construct 18 miles
       (29 km) of main line track extending north from National City.
     * January 2, 1882: The California Southern begins regular passenger
       and freight service between its National City terminus and
       Fallbrook Junction, just north of Oceanside.
     * August 12, 1888: Santa Fe completes the " Surf Line" run between
       Los Angeles and San Diego under the auspices of its subsidiary, the
       California Southern. The line is initially referred to as the Los
       Angeles — San Diego "Short Line" as it replaces the circuitous
       inland route through Temecula Canyon.
     * January 13, 1913: Locomotive No. 1275 (a Baldwin-built 4-6-2),
       bound for La Grande Station in Los Angeles, leads the Saint out of
       San Diego and derails as it descends the Sorrento Grade due to
       excessive speed. The engineer and 21 passengers are killed, and the
       fireman suffers a broken leg; all of the railroad equipment is
       essentially destroyed in the mishap. Public pressure is brought
       upon the railroad to construct a tunnel through the Soledad
       Mountains in order to guard against similar accidents in the
       future.
     * 1924: The Santa Fe submits plans for the Soledad Tunnel to the
       California Railroad Commission for approval. Owing to a post–World
       War I backlog, it takes nearly a year for the Commission to review
       the request, which is ultimately denied due to fears that the
       technology did not yet exist to construct a structure that would
       withstand the effects of an 8.0 magnitude earthquake.
     * April 25, 1925: Southbound train No. 76, led by Engine No. 1332 (a
       Baldwin 4-6-2), leaves the tracks while ascending the Sorrento
       Grade at virtually the same location that the 1913 derailment took
       place. As in the 1913 tragedy, most of the railroad equipment is
       either severely damaged or destroyed outright, though in this
       instance the only fatal injury is suffered by the engineer; it
       takes several days to clear the wreckage and reopen the line to
       traffic.
     * 1936: The Santa Fe orders a six-car train from Budd Company
       specifically for the initiation of San Diegan service.
     * March 27, 1938: The Santa Fe inaugurates the San Diegan route,
       operating on a two hour and 45 minute schedule.

   Train No. 71, the southbound San Diegan, inches its way through the
   morning fog in Los Angeles, California on August 1, 1940.

     * December 31, 1940: No. 1676, a 2-10-2 type locomotive with a 40-car
       freight train in tow, jumps the rails while cruising north via the
       Sorrento Grade and lands in the Pacific Ocean, with much of the
       rolling stock following suit. No one is killed in the accident, and
       it is many days before all of the wreckage can be pulled out of the
       sea.
     * June 8, 1941: A second lightweight train consisting of six coaches,
       a baggage-mail car, a tavern lunch-counter car, and a round-end
       observation car is added to the line. Service is increased to four
       daily round trips utilizing streamliners and one round trip using
       conventional equipment.
     * October 27, 1941: A fifth, steam-powered train is added to the
       schedule, due in part to the need to transport military personnel
       to and from San Diego's bases. This semi-streamlined train carries
       a full buffet car, a diner, and three coaches that had all
       previously run as the Valley Flyer between Oakland and Bakersfield.
       The number of daily trains servicing the route increases to 16, on
       average.
     * 1942: The average number of trains per day increases to 42. Consist
       size expands to 13 cars, and each logs 512 daily miles. Trains
       consisting of 10-12 former Southern Pacific- Pacific Electric
       non-electrified interurban cars, owned by the U.S. Maritime
       Commission but bearing ATSF markings, are fitted with conventional
       knuckle couplers at each end of the trainset and pressed into
       service to handle the additional passenger loads.
     * April 18, 1942: A packed, northbound San Diegan collides with a
       local, steam-powered (Atlantic 1468) freight train at the Orange
       Junction, located in the City of Orange. Several passengers receive
       minor injuries, and rail traffic must be rerouted via Atwood and
       the Olive District until the wreckage is cleared and the tracks
       repaired. Locomotives #3 and #3A are badly damaged in the incident.
     * May 13, 1942: Locomotives #2L and #2A, operating as the first
       section of train No. 73, strike a gasoline tanker at a grade
       crossing in Hobart. Both units are damaged by fire.
     * April 1943: The "over-the-road" time is lengthened to three hours
       due to ever-increasing military movements.
     * May 10, 1943: Santa Fe adds a second mainline track along the San
       Diego line between La Mirada and Fullerton to accommodate increased
       wartime traffic. Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) is installed on
       the line.
     * December 14, 1943: Train No. 77 is struck by a tractor-trailer rig
       in Santa Ana. "Chair" car #3094 sustains damage in the collision.

   Santa Fe #358, a GE U28CG, along with its companion unit #353, makes a
   rare appearance at the head of the northbound San Diegan in 1968.

     * May 1952: Two Budd-built RDCs are put into express service. The
       twin cars make two daily round trips on a two hour and 15 minute
       schedule.
     * August 23, 1953: Santa Fe 3751 pulls the last steam-powered trains
       (Nos. 72 and 73) on the "Surf Line."
     * January 10, 1954: The use of round-end observation cars is
       discontinued in order to eliminate the need to "turn" the trains in
       San Diego before heading northward.
     * January 25, 1954: The RDCs (running as train No. 80) strike a truck
       in Cardiff.
     * February 11, 1954: The RDCs (making up train No. 81) collide with
       an automobile in Encinitas.
     * October 14, 1954: RDC #DC191 strikes and automobile in Morena and
       sustains damage in the collision. RDC #DC192 operates solo as train
       Nos. 80 and 81 until repairs to its companion unit are completed at
       San Bernardino.
     * January 22, 1956: The RDCs (making up train No. 82) derail in a
       high-speed accident at Redondo Junction, just south of the Los
       Angeles Union Passenger Terminal ( LAUPT), killing 30 and seriously
       injuring 117. This was the units' last run on the "Surf Line."  The
       radio reports of this accident were one of the first major uses of
       the Sigalert (known at the time as a "Sigmon Traffic Alert").
     * March 1956: General Motors' Aerotrain makes a series of
       experimental runs as a San Diegan consist. Thoughts of placing it
       in permanent service are quickly abandoned as the entire trainset
       has to be turned at each end of the line, and requires helper
       locomotives on the Sorrento Grade.
     * April 28, 1956: Heavyweight local trains Nos. 70 and 75 are
       discontinued due to operational losses.
     * Summer 1956: Santa Fe's El Capitan makes three demonstration runs
       to San Diego to promote its new "Hi-Level" cars. The railroad
       begins placing illuminated drumheads (formerly mounted on round-end
       observation cars) on the vestibule gate of the trailing cars of the
       San Diegan. Service on the line is reduced to six daily round
       trips.
     * Summer 1958: Service is further reduced to five daily round trips
       and weekend extra trains.
     * September 3, 1958: Train No. 70 strikes a motor truck at a grade
       crossing in San Juan Capistrano; locomotive #340L sustains moderate
       damage.

   Amtrak Train No. 580 (powered by an EMD F40PH in "push" mode) departs
   the station in Fullerton, California with the southbound San Diegan in
   January, 1998.

   January, 1998.
     * November 19, 1958: An F4D Skyray fighter jet overshoots the runway
       at the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro and is struck by
       southbound train No. 74 at 75 miles-per-hour. All three locomotives
       and cars #3430, #3165, #3144, #1399, #3100, #3094, #3082 derail. No
       fatalities and only a few injuries result.
     * January 14, 1959: Locomotive #20C, leading train No. 75, collides
       with a gravel truck at a grade crossing in Irvine: the unit
       sustains considerable damage and is "set out."
     * August 2, 1961: Train No. 76 strikes a gravel truck in Anaheim.
       Locomotives #339L-A-B and cars #3076, #3119, #3179, #3145, #3100,
       and #3158 are derailed.
     * October 29, 1962: Train No. 76 is struck a gravel truck in Anaheim,
       derailing "chair" cars #3082, #3147, and #3146 on the Santa Ana
       River Bridge.
     * July 31, 1964: Mail trains Nos. 70 and 81 are dropped as all mail
       between Los Angeles and San Diego is now transported via truck
       (Santa Fe's mail contract expired on July 1st and was not renewed).
     * 1965: Service is further reduced to three daily round trips (train
       Nos. 73–78) on a two hour and 55 minute schedule.
     * December 22, 1965: Train No. 76 collides with a gravel truck in
       Anaheim. Locomotives #61L and #51C, and cars #3084, #3156, #3152,
       #3179, and #3076 all derail.
     * May 1, 1971: Amtrak is formed and takes over operation of the San
       Diegan.
     * July, 1996: The IC3 Flexliner is put into two-week trial service
       during the height of the Del Mar horseracing season.
     * June 1, 2000: Amtrak retires the San Diegan and replaces it with
       the Pacific Surfliner, which runs between San Diego and San Luis
       Obispo, California.

Equipment used

   Motive power consisted of a single 1,800 hp EMD E1A locomotive sporting
   the familiar Warbonnet paint scheme. These units would, in time, be
   replaced by ALCO PA and PB power and EMD F3 and F7 locomotives. Santa
   Fe's lone trio of Fairbanks-Morse (FM) " Erie-built" locomotives and
   the odd GE U28CG could also be seen occasionally running the line.

   A lone pair of Budd-built 90-seat, self-powered Rail Diesel Cars (
   RDCs) were acquired for express service. They operated "back-to-back"
   as a single train unit from May, 1952 until their destruction in
   January, 1956.

   In 1938, the rolling stock delivered for the San Diegan consisted of
   all lightweight stainless steel cars built by the Budd Company. The
   equipment used was as follows:
   The San Diegan, led by a pair of EMD E1 locomotives, rolls south along
   the Pacific Coast through San Clemente.

     * "Chair" car / Coach (52 seats) #3137
     * Tavern–Lunch Counter Diner #1398
     * Round-end Parlor– Observation #3240

   Three additional coach units were added for weekend traffic. The San
   Diegan also enjoyed almost exclusive use of Santa Fe's Pullman-built
   (PPS) " pendulum-suspension" chair car, #1100.

   In June, 1941 the railroad added a second eight-car trainset, also
   built by Budd, to handle the high demand for passage aboard the train.
   Its original consist was similar to the above save for an additional
   coach. Subsequent consists varied according to the traffic levels.

   A representative, all-lightweight consist from the Summer of 1955:
     * Baggage-Mail car
     * RPO-Baggage car
     * "Chair" car / Coach (52 seats)
     * "Chair" car / Coach (52 seats)
