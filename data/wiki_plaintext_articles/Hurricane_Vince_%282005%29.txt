   Hurricane Vince was one of the most unusual hurricanes ever to develop
   in the Atlantic basin, forming in October during the 2005 Atlantic
   hurricane season. Vince was the 20th named tropical cyclone and twelfth
   hurricane of the extremely active season.

   Vince developed from a non-tropical system on October 8, becoming a
   subtropical storm southeast of the Azores. The National Hurricane
   Centre did not officially name the storm until the next day, shortly
   before Vince briefly became a hurricane. Vince then made an
   unprecedented landfall on the Iberian Peninsula on October 11 as a
   tropical depression, dissipating over Spain.

Storm history

   On October 5, an operationally unnamed subtropical storm that had gone
   unnoticed was absorbed by a non-tropical frontal low, which was moving
   to the southeast over the Azores. It began to gain a more concentrated
   circulation and lose its frontal structure after absorbing the
   Subtropical Storm. The increasingly organized system became a
   subtropical storm early on October 8, 580 miles (930 km) southeast of
   the Azores. However, the National Hurricane Centre decided not to name
   the system Vince at the time, because the water temperature was too low
   for a tropical cyclone to normally develop. Vince gradually gained more
   tropical characteristics and became a tropical storm the next day, over
   water cooler than 24 °C (75 °F), which defies general thought that sea
   surface temperatures of at least 26.5ºC (80°F) are required for a
   tropical storm to form and intensify.

   Soon after it had become a tropical storm on October 9, the NHC
   officially named Tropical Storm Vince when it was near Madeira and
   began to issue advisories. There was still some uncertainty as to
   whether Vince was tropical or subtropical at this time and the
   forecasters of the NHC conceded that Vince may have already been a
   subtropical storm before it was named. Vince reached its peak as a
   hurricane with 75 mph (120 km/h) winds later that day, the National
   Hurricane Centre deciding that "if it looks like a hurricane — it
   probably is — despite its environment and unusual location".

   Hurricane Vince immediately began to weaken in response to increasing
   westerly shear and soon became a tropical storm again. Vince continued
   to weaken as it approached the Iberian Peninsula and became a tropical
   depression shortly before it made landfall near Huelva, Spain on
   October 11. The fast-moving tropical depression soon dissipated over
   land.

Impact

   No damages or fatalities were reported from Hurricane Vince. The
   highest winds reported on land were 77 km/h (48 mph) at Jerez, Spain,
   though some ships recorded stronger winds. Vince was comparable to
   normal rain events from non-tropical systems, with only 1 to 2 inches
   (25 to 50 mm) of rain falling. Through a play on words of a song in My
   Fair Lady, National Hurricane Centre forecaster James Franklin in the
   Tropical Cyclone Report for Vince wrote, "the rain in Spain was mainly
   less than 2 inches, although 3.30 inches (84 mm) fell in the plain at
   Cordoba."

Records and naming

   Although Hurricane Vince was a very small and short-lived storm, it is
   notable for developing in the northeastern Atlantic off the Moroccan
   coast, well away from where tropical cyclones are usually found. It is
   the farthest northeast a tropical cyclone had ever developed in the
   Atlantic (32.9°N 20.6°W); previously the record was held by Ivan of the
   1980 season, at 35.6°N and 24.6°W. Vince is neither the most
   northerly-forming nor the most easterly-forming Atlantic tropical
   storm; these records are held by Alberto of the 1988 season at 41.5°N,
   and Ginger of the 1967 season at 18.1°W, respectively.

   Hurricane Vince developed into a hurricane further east than any known
   storm at 18.9°W. Vince is the first tropical cyclone on record to have
   made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula, after coming ashore near
   Huelva, Spain.

   When Subtropical Storm Vince formed on October 8, it was the earliest
   ever in the season that the twenty-first tropical or subtropical storm
   had developed, 38 days ahead of the previous record held by Tropical
   Storm 21 of the 1933 season. Hurricane Vince was also the first named
   "V" storm in the Atlantic since naming began in 1950. Due to the lack
   of any significant effects from Hurricane Vince, the name was not
   retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will be on the
   list of names for the 2011 season.
