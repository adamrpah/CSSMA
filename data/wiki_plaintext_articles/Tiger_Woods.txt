   Eldrick "Tiger" Woods (born December 30, 1975 in Cypress, California)
   is an American professional golfer whose achievements to date rank him
   among the most successful golfers of all time. Currently the World No.
   1, Woods was the highest paid professional athlete in 2005, having
   earned an estimated $87 million. In 2006, at the age of 30, he won his
   eleventh and twelfth professional major golf championships and has more
   wins on the PGA Tour than any other active golfer. He is the only
   active golfer currently in the top 10 in either career major wins or
   career PGA Tour wins.

   Woods, who is multiracial, is credited with prompting a major surge of
   interest in the game of golf among minorities and young people in the
   United States.

Background and family

   Woods' father, Earl Woods, was a Vietnam veteran and a retired U.S.
   Army lieutenant colonel, of mixed African American (50 percent),
   Chinese (25 percent) and Native American (25 percent) ancestry. He was
   the chairman of his son's charitable foundation (the Tiger Woods
   Foundation) before his death at age 74 on May 3, 2006, following a
   lengthy battle with prostate cancer (see section charity and youth
   projects below). Woods' mother, Kultida Woods, is originally from
   Thailand, and is of mixed Thai (50 percent), Chinese (25 percent), and
   Dutch (25 percent) ancestry. This makes Woods himself one- quarter
   Chinese, one-quarter Thai, one-quarter African, one-eighth Native
   American, and one-eighth Dutch. He affably refers to his ethnic make-up
   as Cablinasian (a portmanteau of Caucasian, Black, American-Indian, and
   Asian), a term he made up himself.

   Born Eldrick Woods in Cypress, California, he was nicknamed “Tiger”
   after Vuong Dang Phong, a Vietnamese friend of his father’s, who served
   with him in Vietnam. Woods became generally known by that name and by
   the time he had achieved national prominence in junior and amateur golf
   was simply known as "Tiger Woods." He grew up in the Los Angeles area,
   attending high school at Western High in Anaheim. He also served for a
   semester as a United States House of Representatives Page.

   Woods was the only child of Earl and Kultida's marriage, but he does
   have two half-brothers, Earl Jr. (b. 1955) and Kevin (b. 1957), and one
   half-sister, Royce (b. 1958) from the 18-year marriage of Earl Woods
   and his first wife, Barbara Woods Gray. Earl Junior's daughter Cheyenne
   Woods (b. 1991), Woods' niece, is also a golfer and had received some
   coaching from Earl Sr.

Marriage

   In November 2003, Woods became engaged to Elin Nordegren, a Swedish
   model. They were introduced by Swedish golf star Jesper Parnevik, who
   had employed her as a nanny, during The Open Championship in 2001. They
   married on October 5, 2004 and live at Isleworth, a community in
   Windermere, a suburb of Orlando, Florida. They also have homes in
   Jackson, Wyoming, California, and Sweden. In January 2006, Woods and
   his wife purchased a US$39 million residential property in Jupiter
   Island, Florida, which they intend to make their primary residence.
   Woods' Jupiter Island neighbors will include fellow golfers Gary
   Player, Greg Norman and Nick Price, as well as singers Celine Dion and
   Alan Jackson.

Career

Amateur career

   Woods was a child prodigy who began to play golf at the age of two. In
   1978, he demonstrated his golf skills in a television appearance on The
   Mike Douglas Show. At age three, Woods shot a 48 over nine holes at the
   Navy Golf Club in Cypress, California, and at age five, he appeared in
   Golf Digest and on ABC's That's Incredible. In 1984, he won the 9–10
   boys' event at the Junior World Golf Championships. He was only eight
   years old at the time, but 9–10 was the youngest age group available.
   Woods went on to win the Junior World Championships six times,
   including four consecutive wins from 1988 to 1991. Also in 1991, at the
   age of 15, he became the youngest U.S. Junior Amateur Champion in golf
   history. He was voted Southern California Amateur Player of the Year
   for the second consecutive year, and Golf Digest Amateur Player of the
   Year. In 1992, he successfully defended his title at the U.S. Junior
   Amateur Championship, and competed in his first PGA Tour event, the
   Nissan Los Angeles Open. The following year, he won his third
   consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, and remains the event's
   youngest-ever and only multiple winner. In 1994, Woods became the
   youngest ever winner of the U.S. Amateur Championship. He was a member
   of the American team at the 1994 World Amateur Golf Team Championships.
   Later that year, he enrolled at Stanford University, and won his first
   collegiate event, the William Tucker Invitational. In 1995, Woods
   defended his U.S. Amateur title, and was voted Pac-10 Player of the
   Year, NCAA First Team All-American, and Stanford's Male Freshman of the
   Year (an award that encompasses all sports). He participated in his
   first PGA Tour major, The Masters, and tied for 41st as the only
   amateur to make the cut. At age 20 in 1996, Woods became the first
   golfer in history to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles. That
   year he won the NCAA individual golf championship, and tied the British
   Open record for an amateur with an aggregate score of 281. He left
   college after two years to become a professional golfer.

   With the announcement, "Hello World," Tiger Woods became a professional
   golfer in August 1996, and immediately signed endorsement deals worth
   $40 million from Nike and $20 million from Titleist. He played his
   first round of professional golf at the Greater Milwaukee Open. He tied
   for 60th place in his pro debut, but would go on to win two events in
   the next three months, and qualified for the Tour Championship. Woods
   was named 1996's " Sportsman of the Year" by Sports Illustrated for the
   impact he had on the game of golf, and PGA Rookie of the Year by the
   PGA Tour. He is the only golfer to win the PGA Player of the Year award
   in the year following his rookie season. The following April, Woods won
   his first golf major, The Masters, by a record margin of 12 strokes,
   became the youngest Masters winner, and the first winner of African or
   Asian descent. He set a total of 20 Masters records and tied 6 others,
   and has been the highest-profile golfer in the world ever since. He
   would go on to win an additional three PGA Tour events that year, and
   On June 15, 1997, Woods rose to the number one spot in the Official
   World Golf Rankings for the first time. He achieved this in only his
   42nd week as a professional -- the fastest ever ascent to the No. 1
   ranking.

   While expectations for Woods were high, Woods' form began to fade in
   the second half of 1997, and in 1998 he only won one PGA Tour event.
   Woods answered the critics of his "slump" and what seemed to be his
   wavering form by maintaining that he was undergoing extensive swing
   changes with his coach, Butch Harmon, and was hoping to do better in
   the future.

   In June 1999, Woods won the Memorial Tournament, a victory that marked
   the beginning of perhaps one of the greatest sustained periods of
   dominance in the history of men's golf. He would go on to win seventeen
   PGA Tour events in the two calendar years that followed, and 32 in the
   next five, achievements that had not been rivaled in several decades.
   He completed his 1999 campaign by winning his last four starts, and
   finishing the season with eight wins — a feat that had not been
   achieved in the past 25 years. He was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year
   and AP Male Athlete of the Year for the second time in three years.
   Also in late 1999, Woods embarked on a record-setting streak of 264
   consecutive weeks atop the Official World Golf Rankings. He has been
   number one in the rankings more weeks than anyone. During the run,
   Woods won seven out of the eleven major championships, starting with
   the 1999 PGA Championship at Medinah Country Club and finishing with
   the 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black. Woods broke Old Tom Morris's
   record for the largest victory margin ever in a major championship,
   which had stood since 1862, with his 15-shot win in the 2000 U.S. Open
   at Pebble Beach.

   Woods rang in the new millennium with his fifth consecutive victory and
   began what would be a record-setting season, where he would win three
   consecutive majors, 9 PGA Tour events, and set or tie 27 TOUR records.
   He went on to capture his sixth consecutive victory at the AT&T Pebble
   Beach National Pro-Am with a comeback for the ages. Trailing by seven
   strokes with seven holes to play, Woods finished
   eagle-birdie-par-birdie for a 64 and a two-stroke victory. His six
   consecutive wins were the most since Hogan in 1948 and only five behind
   Byron Nelson’s record of 11 in a row. In the 2000 U.S. Open, Woods
   broke or tied a total of nine U.S. Open records, and became the Tour's
   all-time career money leader. In the 2000 Open Championship at St
   Andrews, which he won by eight strokes, Woods set the record for lowest
   score to par (−19) in any major tournament, and he holds at least a
   share of that record in all four major championships. His major
   championship streak was seriously threatened at the 2000 PGA
   Championship, however, when Bob May went head-to-head with Woods on
   Sunday at Valhalla in Louisville, matching Woods stroke-for-stroke.
   Woods only escaped with a victory after winning a three-hole playoff,
   with a heart-pumping birdie on the first hole and pars on the next two.
   He joined Ben Hogan (1953) as the only other player to win three
   professional majors in one season. The next season, Woods went back to
   dominating: his 2001 Masters win marked the only time — within the era
   of the modern "grand slam" — that any player was the holder of all four
   major championship titles at the same time. This feat has become known
   as the "Tiger Slam". His adjusted scoring average of 67.79 in 2000 was
   the lowest in PGA Tour history, lower than his 68.43 average in 1999.
   His actual scoring average of 68.17 in 2000 was the lowest in PGA Tour
   history, besting Byron Nelson's 68.33 average in 1945.

   The next phase of Woods' career saw him remain among the top
   competitors on the tour, but lose his dominating edge. He did not win a
   major in 2003 or 2004, falling to second in the PGA Tour money list in
   2003 and fourth in 2004. In September 2004, Woods' record streak as the
   world's top-ranked golfer came to an end at the Deutsche Bank
   Championship in Norton, Massachusetts, when Vijay Singh won the
   tournament and overtook Woods in the rankings. Even though no one has
   held the number one ranking for more total weeks than Woods, many
   commentators were puzzled by Woods' "slump," offering explanations that
   ranged from Woods' rift with swing coach Butch Harmon to his recent
   marriage to Elin Nordegren. At the same time, Woods let it be known
   that he was once again working on changes to his swing — this time in
   hopes of reducing the wear and tear on his surgically-repaired left
   knee, which was subjected to severe stress in the 1998–2003 version of
   his swing. Again, Woods anticipated that once the adjustments were
   complete, he would return to his previous form.

   In the 2005 PGA Tour season, Woods quickly returned to his winning
   ways. On March 6, 2005 he outplayed Phil Mickelson to win the Ford
   Championship at Doral, and returned to the Official World Golf
   Rankings' number one position in the process (though Singh displaced
   him once again two weeks later). On April 10, 2005, Woods finally broke
   his "drought" in the majors by winning the 2005 Masters in a
   tie-breaking playoff (after holing a historic chip-in on the 16th
   hole), which also assured him the number one spot in the World Rankings
   again. Singh and Woods swapped the number 1 position several times over
   the next couple of months, but by early July, Woods had established a
   substantial advantage, propelled further by a victory in the Open
   Championship, a win that also gave him his 10th major. Woods went on to
   win six official money events on the PGA Tour in 2005, topping the
   money list for the sixth time in his career. Woods' 2005 wins also
   included two at the World Golf Championships.

   For Woods, the year 2006 was markedly different from 2005. While he
   began just as dominantly (winning the first two tournaments he entered
   on the year) and was in the hunt for his fifth Masters championship in
   April, Woods surprisingly never mounted a Sunday charge to defend his
   title at Augusta, allowing Phil Mickelson to claim the green jacket.
   Shortly thereafter ( May 3, 2006), Woods' father/mentor/inspiration,
   Earl, died after a lengthy battle with prostate cancer. The loss was
   devastating to Woods, who took a nine-week-long hiatus from the PGA
   Tour to be with his family in the wake of Earl's death. When he finally
   returned for the 2006 U.S. Open, the rust was evident — he would
   eventually miss the cut at Winged Foot, the first time he had failed to
   qualify for the weekend at a major in his professional career, and
   thereby ending his record-tying streak of 39 consecutive cuts made at
   major championships. A tie for second at the Western Open just three
   weeks later went a long way toward silencing doubts about his game,
   though, and Woods seemed poised to defend his Open crown at Hoylake
   despite his grief. At The Open Championship, Woods would stage a tour
   de force in successful course management, putting, and accuracy with
   irons. Using almost exclusively long irons off the tee (he hit driver
   only one time the entire week — the 16th hole of the first round),
   Woods missed just four fairways all week (hitting the fairway 86
   percent of the time), and his score of −18 to par (three eagles, 19
   birdies, 43 pars, and only seven bogeys) was just one off of his major
   championship record −19, set at St Andrews in 2000. The victory was an
   emotional one for Woods, who dedicated his play to his father's memory.
   Several weeks later, at the PGA Championship, Woods once again won in
   dominating fashion. He finished the tournament at −18 to par and added
   more records to his already-impressive resume, equaling the to-par
   record in the PGA that he shares with Bob May. Woods now holds at least
   a share of the scoring record in relation to par in all four majors,
   and also holds the margin of victory record in two majors, The Masters
   and the U.S. Open. (Old Tom Morris holds this record in the The Open
   Championship, and Nicklaus holds this record in the PGA Championship.)

   As of November 2006, Woods has won 54 official money events on the PGA
   Tour and at 30 years and 7 months old is the youngest to the 50-win
   mark. At the close of his first eleven seasons, Tiger had eclipsed the
   all time eleven-season PGA Tour total win record of 52 (set by Byron
   Nelson) and total majors record of 11 (set by Jack Nicklaus). He also
   has 19 other individual professional titles, and two team titles in the
   two-man WGC-World Cup. With his victory at the 2006 WGC-American
   Express Championship, he became the first player in PGA Tour history to
   win at least eight times in three seasons. It also placed him tied for
   2nd for the longest PGA Tour win streak at 6 straight, tied with
   himself (99–00) and Ben Hogan (1948). Only Byron Nelson's streak of 11
   wins in 1945 is longer. He has successfully defended a title 16 times
   on the PGA Tour, has finished runner-up 20 times, and has won 27% (54
   out of 200) of his professional starts on the PGA Tour. He has a 38–3
   winning record when leading after 54 holes in TOUR events, and owns the
   lowest career scoring average and the most career earnings of any
   player in PGA Tour history. Woods is one of five players (along with
   Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player) to have won
   all four professional major championships in his career, known as the
   "Career Grand Slam", and was the youngest to do so. Bobby Jones won all
   four of what were in his era considered major championships. With
   Woods's win in The Open Championship of 2005, he became the second
   golfer (after Nicklaus) to have won all four majors more than once. At
   the 2003 TOUR Championship, it was widely reported in the print media
   that he set "an all-time record for most consecutive cuts", starting in
   1998, with 114 (passing Byron Nelson's previous record of 113) and that
   he extended this mark to 142 before it ended on May 13, 2005 at the EDS
   Byron Nelson Championship. Many consider this to be one of the most
   remarkable golf accomplishments of all time, given the margin by which
   he broke the old record (and against stronger fields in terms of depth
   than those in Nelson's day) and given that during the streak, the next
   longest streak by any other player was usually only in the 10s or 20s.

   Woods won the "World Sportsman of the Year" award at the Laureus World
   Sports Awards in 2000 and 2001. He is the only individual two-time
   winner of Sports Illustrated magazine's " Sportsman of the Year" award
   (1996, 2000).

   When Woods turned pro, Mike "Fluff" Cowan was his caddie until March 8,
   1999. He was replaced by Steve Williams, who has become a close friend
   of Woods and is often credited with helping Woods with key shots and
   putts.

Playing style

   When Woods burst onto the professional golf scene in 1996, one of the
   things that made the biggest impact with fans was his long driving.
   However, when he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years
   (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs
   and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance), many
   opponents caught up to him, a trend that became all too obvious during
   the 2002–2003 PGA Tour seasons — Phil Mickelson would even make a joke
   in 2003 about Woods using "inferior equipment", which did not sit well
   with either Nike or Woods. During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his
   driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which
   coupled with his prodigious clubhead speed to make him one of the
   Tour's lengthier players off the tee once again.

   Despite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an
   excellent all-around game. Although in recent years he has typically
   been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron
   play is generally as accurate as any player ever to play (including
   Jack Nicklaus), his recovery and bunker play is often brilliant (for
   example, his miraculous 30-foot chip-in at Augusta's 16th during the
   2005 Masters), and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly
   his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher
   standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for
   putting in more hours of practice than most.

   Early in his professional career, Woods worked almost exclusively with
   leading swing coach Butch Harmon, but since March 2004, he has been
   coached by Hank Haney. In June 2004, Woods was involved in a media spat
   with Harmon, who also works as a golf broadcaster, when Harmon
   suggested that he was in "denial" about the problems in his game, but
   they publicly patched up their differences.

   Although he is considered one of the most charismatic figures in golf's
   history, Woods' approach is, at its core, cautious. He aims for
   consistency. Although he is better than any other Tour player when he
   is in top form, his dominance comes not from regularly posting
   extremely low rounds, but instead from avoiding bad rounds. To
   illustrate, the standard deviations of Woods' 18-hole scores are
   typically lower than those of most Tour players. Woods plays fewer
   tournaments than most professionals (20–23 per year, compared to the
   typical 25–30), and focuses his efforts on preparing for (and peaking
   at) the Majors and the most prestigious of the other tournaments.
   Woods' manner off of the course is cautious as well, as he carries
   himself in interviews and public appearances with a carefully
   controlled demeanor reminiscent of the corporate athlete persona
   developed between Nike and Michael Jordan. One of the few breaches of
   Woods' fan-friendly image occurred during the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble
   Beach, on the 18th tee in the second round. Using a driver, Woods
   snap-hooked his tee shot into the Pacific Ocean, then let loose with a
   stream of expletives that NBC's microphones broadcast live. The USGA
   received several calls from offended viewers, and Woods quickly
   apologized.

   Though he is known to be extremely focused and almost machine-like
   during tournaments, many golfers have mentioned how Woods is easy to
   get along with and has a good sense of humor. John Daly mentioned in
   his autobiography that "Tiger Woods is one of my favorite golfers to
   play with. The kid is an absolute riot and is just hysterical. Everyone
   who thinks he is just robotic during tournaments needs to walk 18 holes
   with him to realize how funny and genuine of a guy he really is."

   Woods almost always wears a shirt in a red shade during the final round
   (usually on Sundays) of every tournament in which he plays. He believes
   the colour red symbolizes aggression and assertiveness.

Records and trivia

   In all of his major victories, he has had the outright lead or a share
   of the lead after the third round.

   Woods also won the Silver Medal as leading amateur at The Open
   Championship in 1996 before he turned professional.

   After his victory in the 2000 PGA Championship, Tiger Woods became only
   the second player in professional golfing history to hold three majors
   in the same year at the same time. This matched Ben Hogan's feat in
   1953.

   With his victory in The Masters in 2001, Woods became the only player
   ever to hold all four professional majors at once (although this did
   not occur in a calendar year, and is therefore not considered a true
   Grand Slam). The achievement has been nicknamed "The Tiger Slam".

   Tiger Woods and Lee Trevino have been the only two players to have
   captured the three national opens (U.S., British, and Canadian) in one
   year: Trevino in 1971 and Woods in 2000.

   In the 2006 PGA Championship, Woods made only three bogeys, tying the
   record for fewest bogeys in a major.

   Woods holds at least a share of the record for lowest 72-hole score in
   relation to par in all four majors, and at least a share of the low-72
   holes record in two of them. Note that the "to par" and "low 72-holes"
   records are not always the same because, while most championship golf
   courses have a par of 72, or 288 for four rounds, some have a par of 71
   or 70:
     * The Masters: −18 (270), 1997 (outright to-par and low 72 holes
       record)
     * US Open: −12 (272), 2000 (outright to par record)
          + Woods shares the low 72-holes record with Jack Nicklaus, Lee
            Janzen, and Jim Furyk.
     * The Open Championship: −19 (269), 2000 (outright to-par record)
          + Greg Norman holds the low 72-holes record at 267.
     * PGA Championship: −18 (270), 2000; −18 (270), 2006 (to-par record
       shared with Bob May)
          + David Toms holds the low 72-holes record at 265.

   The above performances have also given him the record for victory
   margin in two majors:
     * The Masters: 12 strokes, 1997
     * U.S. Open: 15 strokes, 2000 (record for all majors)

   Woods is the only player to have won multiple professional majors in
   consecutive years, 2005 and 2006. Bobby Jones won multiple majors in
   consecutive years in 1926 and 1927 , when the US Amateur and the
   British Amateur were both considered majors.

   Woods has won two or more majors in a year four times. He trails only
   Nicklaus, who won two majors in a season five times (1963, '66, '72,
   '75 and '80).

   Woods is one of the few players to have finished in the Top 5 in all
   four majors in a year. He has done this twice, first in 2000 and then
   in 2005.

   Woods and Bobby Jones are the only golfers to have won 10 majors before
   the age of 30. Jones achieved 13 major victories in 21 attempts, making
   his winning percentage 62 percent, while Woods achieved 10 wins in 44
   attempts for a winning ratio of 23 percent. When Woods' three
   consecutive US Junior Amateur wins and three consecutive US Amateur
   wins are included, Woods can be said to have won 16 'majors' before age
   30 in 50 attempts for a winning ratio of 32 percent.

Greatest shot

   Establishing which particular shot has been the greatest ever played by
   Woods is subjective, but his caddy Steve Williams is in no doubt it was
   during the second round of 2002 PGA Championship. Williams, who has
   caddied for Woods during 10 of his 12 major wins, was the subject of an
   hour-long documentary called The Chosen Ones, produced by SPARC, (Sport
   And Recreation New Zealand), and aired on Sky TV. Williams was told
   that a lot of people considered the holed-out chip shot at the 2005
   Masters to be his best ever, and was asked "is this the one that sticks
   in your mind"? Williams shook his head and replied:

          "Undoubtedly the greatest shot I have seen from him, and from
          anybody, and I don't think I will ever -- and I could caddy for
          another 20 years -- I will ever see a greater shot (than) during
          the 2002 PGA Championship on the final hole there , 18th hole,
          197 yards out of a fairway trap. (He) barely could get in the
          trap to make a stance, had a big lip in front of him, had a huge
          row of pine trees in front of him, howling crosswind left to
          right, uphill shot -- 99 percent of players would chip out
          sideways and there would be a few players might try to advance
          with an 8 iron. He goes in there with a 3 iron, and I mean,
          there's just no way. The lip was a high lip, you'd be lucky to
          get an 8 iron over it and he gets in there with a 3 iron, and
          I'm thinking this is really going to be an interesting shot
          here....and he knocked it there to 15ft, obviously holed the
          putt. We were walking up there and David Toms and Ernie Els, who
          were playing with us, both got their towels and put them on the
          ground and lay down and just bowed to him, and you know, no-one
          will ever hit that shot again".

Memorable shots

   The following are generally regarded as the most memorable shots of
   Woods' career.
     * 2006 The Open Championship – Royal Liverpool – second round – 14th
       hole – 4-iron – 206-yard second shot, carries 196, lands on the
       green and bounces into the cup for an eagle, out of Woods' view.
     * 2006 Masters – Augusta National Golf Club – first round – 14th hole
       – 8-iron – 163 yards for an eagle, his first-ever on a par-4 in the
       tournament.
     * 2005 Masters – Augusta National Golf Club – final round – 16th hole
       – lob wedge – chip from 30 feet, from side of green, with 2nd cut
       of rough interfering with ball, rolled down steep slope, nearly
       stopped millimeters before the cup, then dropped in for birdie.
     * 2003 U.S. Open – Olympia Fields Country Club – second round – 6th
       hole – 3-wood – fade from semi-rough around a tree, from the wrong
       side of the fairway and on to the green.

     * 2002 PGA Championship – Hazeltine National Golf Club – second round
       – 18th hole – 3-iron – 202 yard carry over tall trees from fairway
       bunker.
     * 2001 Players Championship – TPC at Sawgrass – third round – 17th
       hole – putter – 60 foot downhill putt on famous island green;
       eventually won by 1 stroke. Known as the "better than most" putt
       due to NBC announcer Gary Koch initially proclaiming the putt as
       merely "better than most," and then excitedly repeating the phrase
       as the ball wound its way towards the hole.
     * 2000 WGC – Firestone Country Club – final round – 18th hole –
       8-iron – 168 yards – Tiger hits the ball 'stiff' while playing in
       darkness to seal the championship. Reporters later said that they
       struggled to see just where Tiger actually was.
     * 2000 PGA Championship – Valhalla Golf Club – final round – 18th
       hole – putter – 6 foot putt to force playoff and later win.
     * 2000 Bell Canadian Open – Glen Abbey Golf Club – final round – 18th
       hole – 6-iron – 218 yards, from a bunker, over a large pond to
       within 18 feet of the cup to win the tournament. Many competitors
       called it "the kind of shot that I wouldn't even try, let alone
       stick."
     * 2000 AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am – Pebble Beach – final round

Frank

   "Frank" is the name given to the club cover always on Tiger's bag. It
   is a plush tiger head created by his mother Kultida. On it is stitched,
   "from mom with love" in Thai.

   An animatronic version of Frank, created by M5 Industries, was used in
   several Nike Golf commercials starting in 2003, where Frank would give
   advice to Tiger, or even seem to be more a nuisance than a help, much
   in the same vein as the "Lil' Penny" commercials Nike did with Penny
   Hardaway in the mid- 1990s. In one commercial, Frank was talking trash
   at Charles Barkley during a pro-am. In another, when Tiger thought
   Frank was giving bad advice, Tiger told Frank, "You can be replaced."
   (Tiger's mom makes him a new "Frank" every year.)

Other ventures

Charity and youth projects

   Woods has established several charitable and youth projects.
     * The Tiger Woods Foundation: The Tiger Woods Foundation was
       established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl. It focuses on
       projects for children. Initially these comprised golf clinics
       (aimed especially at disadvantaged children), and a grant program.
       Further activities added since then include university
       scholarships, an association with Target House at St. Jude Hospital
       in Memphis, Tennessee; the Start Something character development
       program, which had had over one million participants by 2003; and
       the Tiger Woods Learning Centre.
     * In The City Golf Clinics and Festivals: Since 1997, the Tiger Woods
       Foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country.
       The Foundation began the “In the City” golf clinic program in 2003.
       The first three clinics were held in Indio, Calif., Wilkinsburg,
       Pa., and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and were targeted to all youth,
       ages 7-17, and their families. Each three-day event features golf
       lessons on Thursday and Friday of clinic week and a free community
       festival on Saturday. Cities are selected to participate in the
       clinics through a formal bid process. Winning cities may invite 15
       junior golfers to participate and receive instruction from local
       PGA professionals. Top junior golfers from each In The City Clinic
       are selected to participate in the annual Tiger Woods Foundation
       Youth Clinic. This three-day junior golf event includes tickets to
       Disney Resorts; a pitch, putt and drive skills tournament; a junior
       golf clinic; and an exhibition by Tiger Woods. As part of the
       junior golf clinics, TWF works with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to
       bring at least one Make-A-Wish child to each clinic. These children
       are given the opportunity to meet Tiger, take some photos with him
       and talk to him about anything they choose.
     * Tiger Woods Learning Centre: This is a 35,000 square foot (3,000
       m²) educational facility in Anaheim, California which opened in
       February 2006. It is expected to be used by several thousand
       students each year, with a day program for grades 4 to 6 and an
       after school program for grades 7 to 12. There will also be summer
       programs, weekend and community outreach programs and online
       learning programs. The centre's website states, "Our mission is to
       provide an interactive enrichment program that will improve
       individual aptitude in reading, math, science and technology". The
       centre will feature extensive multi-media facilities and an outdoor
       golf teaching area.
     * Tiger Jam: An annual fundraising concert. 2006's Tiger Jam IX will
       be headlined by Sting.
     * Target World Challenge: An annual off-season charity golf
       tournament. The event also carries generous prize money, but Woods
       donates his winnings to his foundation.
     * Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team: An eighteen
       member team which competes in the annual Junior World Golf
       Championships.

   Woods has also participated in charity work for his current caddy,
   Steve Williams. On April 24, 2006 Woods won an auto racing event that
   benefited the Steve Williams Foundation to raise funds to provide
   sporting careers for disadvantaged youth.

Hobbies

   Outside of golf, Woods enjoys working out, boating, water sports,
   fishing, cooking and car racing. He has never owned an airplane, with
   his sponsor NetJets providing that as part of his sponsorship package.

   In February 2004, Woods signed a contract with Christensen Shipyards
   for summer delivery of a 155 foot Trideck Motor Yacht known as Hull
   026. The 4,000 nautical mile range boat was about two-thirds complete,
   and after Woods agreed a purchase price of around $20 million, his then
   fiancee Elin would travel regularly to the Vancouver, Washington, yard
   to make interior decorating decisions.

   The toys on the boat include: three Sea-Doos, two oceangoing kayaks,
   and a pair of Vespa scooters. She also has six helium tanks (when
   combined with oxygen and nitrogen, helium creates trimix, a breathable
   blend that lets one dive deeper than traditional tanks full of
   compressed air). The boat also has an inflatable decompression chamber,
   an important safety measure for divers who go deeper than the standard
   120-foot recreational limit. All the gear is for spear fishing, with
   Woods once explaining his passion for diving on his website: "The fish
   don't know who I am."

   Part of the contract Woods agreed with the yard was confidentiality —
   although pictures of the boat could be used, its name and interior
   details, through final fittings, were not to be disclosed. After his
   marriage of 5 October, the couple used the boat, now called "Privacy"
   on a honeymoon cruise to Puerto Rico — where on 14 October, the boat
   was boarded by customs officials for not giving the required four days
   entry notice.

   On his return from honeymoon, Woods sued Christensen for more than
   $75,000 in damages, because his privacy was violated. But because of
   Woods' celebrity and how much clout he carries in the advertising
   world, compensatory damages could have reached reach $50 million. The
   action was settled out of court, and it is believed that Christensen
   paid Woods around half the cost of his yacht in compensation.

Endorsements

   Shortly after his 21st birthday, Woods began signing numerous
   endorsement deals. Some of the companies that Woods signed with
   included General Motors, General Mills, American Express, Accenture and
   the one he is most known for – Nike. Woods signed a 5-year, $100
   million endorsing contract with Nike, which at the time was the largest
   endorsing deal ever signed by an athlete. Some of the famous Nike
   advertising campaigns featuring Woods include the "I am Tiger Woods"
   spots, in which children claim they are the golfing superstar. Another
   featured Woods doing a trick with a golf ball in which he bounces a
   ball on a club several times then hits it baseball style. This is a
   routine that Woods often performs during golf exhibitions.

   On Father's Day after the passing of his father in 2006, Nike released
   a commercial featuring home movie clips from Tiger's childhood, usually
   showing Tiger as a child receiving training and support from his
   father. The commercial was dedicated to Earl Woods and "fathers
   everywhere." His talent, looks, youth appeal, and personality have made
   him a bankable celebrity and the highest valued athletic spokesperson
   numerous years in a row. Only Michael Jordan and Arnold Palmer have had
   longer tenures at the top for endorsements and have made more money
   from them overall than Woods.

   Woods also endorses the ' Tiger Woods PGA Tour' series of video games;
   he has done so from 1999 up to 2007 and it is likely that he will
   continue to do so.

   Woods collaborated with TAG Heuer to develop the world's first
   professional golf watch, released in April 2005.

   The PGA Tour prohibits paying players appearance fees but it is common
   elsewhere. Initially, people speculated that Tiger’s appearance fees
   were one million dollars each appearance and in 2006 had escalated to
   three million dollars.

Controversy

   Also in 1996, Woods drew harsh criticism from the media (and his fellow
   Tour pros) when he broke protocol and withdrew from the Buick Challenge
   tournament in Pine Mountain, Georgia; he also failed to attend a dinner
   held in his honour the night before (he later apologized to those in
   attendance). In 1997, a GQ article portrayed Woods as using profanity
   and telling racist and sexist jokes .

   Also in 1997, fellow pro Fuzzy Zoeller referred to Tiger as "that
   little boy" and urged him not to order fried chicken or collard greens
   for the Masters traditional Champion's dinner. This occurred shortly
   after Tiger won his first green jacket in 1997.

   Shortly after winning the Masters in 1997, Woods declined an invitation
   from then United States President Bill Clinton to attend a ceremony at
   Shea Stadium honoring baseball great Jackie Robinson, who had broken
   the colour barrier in baseball 50 years earlier. Woods instead went to
   Atlantic City and to Myrtle Beach to attend ribbon cuttings at openings
   of the All-Star Cafe and then left on vacation. One of Woods' managers
   Hughes Norton defended his action, saying that "It's no disrespect by
   Tiger to Jackie Robinson, who is without question one of Tiger's
   heroes. Nor is it any disrespect to President Clinton. But it's a good
   indication of how important off-time is to Tiger."

   In 2006, following the US Masters, Woods referred to himself as a '
   spaz' in a post-tournament interview, in reference to his putting
   during the tournament. While the comment brought little notice in the
   United States, he was criticized for his use of the word spaz,
   particularly outside of the United States, where the word has a more
   negative connotation, including by Paralympian Dame Tanni
   Grey-Thompson. His manager promptly apologized for the remark on his
   behalf. Woods did not speak directly about his comments.

   Also in 2006, The Dubliner Magazine published graphs purportedly
   depicting his wife. During a Ryder Cup press conference, Woods
   vehemently denied that these photographs contained his wife, saying "to
   link her to sites and such is unacceptable, and I do not accept that at
   all. Neither does our team." The magazine issued an apology, calling it
   pure satire, and a parody of tabloids. According to his agent, Woods is
   studying the merits of a lawsuit.

Cut Streak

   In both Nelson's and Woods's eras, "making the cut" has been defined as
   receiving a paycheck. However, in Nelson's day only players who placed
   in the top 20 in an event won a paycheck whereas in Woods's day only
   players who reach a low enough score within the first 36 holes win a
   paycheck. Several golf analysts argue that Woods did not actually
   surpass Nelson's consecutive cuts mark, reasoning that 31 of the
   tournaments in which Woods competed were "no-cut" events, meaning all
   the players in the field were guaranteed to compete throughout the
   entire event regardless of their scores through 36 holes (and hence all
   "made the cut," meaning that they all received a paycheck). These
   analysts argue that this would leave Woods's final consecutive cuts
   made at 111, and Nelson's at 113.

   At least ten of the tournaments in which Nelson played did not have
   modern day cuts; that is, all of the players in these events were
   guaranteed to compete past 36 holes. The Masters, for example, did not
   institute a 36 hole cut until 1957 (which was well after Nelson
   retired), the PGA Championship was match play until 1958 and it is
   unclear whether or not three other events in which Nelson competed had
   36 hole cuts. Therefore, these analysts remove "no 36 hole cut" events
   from both cut streak measures, leaving Nelson's consecutive cuts made
   at 103 (or possibly less) and Woods's at 111. However, in the
   tournaments in which Nelson competed that did not have 36 hole cuts
   (that is: the Masters, PGA Championship and the possible 3 other
   tournaments) only the top 20 players received a paycheck even though
   all players in these events were guaranteed to compete past 36 holes.
   Hence in these no 36 hole cut events, Nelson still placed in the top
   20, so Nelson's 113 cuts made is reflective of his 113 top 20 finishes.
   Woods achieved a top 20 finish 21 consecutive times (from July 2000 to
   July 2001) and, in the 31 no-cut events in which he played, he won 10
   and finished out of the top 10 five times. Others, including Woods
   himself, argue that the two streaks cannot be compared, because the
   variation of tournament structures in the two eras is too great for any
   meaningful comparison to be made.

Tiger-Proofing

   Early in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed
   concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game (and thus
   the public appeal of professional golf). This issue was most prominent
   from 1999-2002, when Woods was at his most dominant. Sports writer Bill
   Lyon of Knight-Ridder asked in a column, "Isn't Tiger Woods actually
   bad for golf?" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he wasn't). At
   first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of
   competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete
   and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each
   week.

   Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including Major Championship
   sites like Augusta National) began to add yardage to their tees in an
   effort to slow down long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became
   known as "Tiger-Proofing". Woods himself welcomed the change as he
   believes adding yardage to the course doesn't affect his ability to
   win.

   In 2006 Tiger demonstrated his "intelligence game", as he won both The
   Open and PGA Championships without out-driving his playing partner. In
   fact, during The Open Championship, Tiger only used his driver once,
   instead choosing long irons off the tee to hit fairways more
   consistently.
