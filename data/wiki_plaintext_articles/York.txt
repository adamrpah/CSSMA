   York is a city in Northern England, at the confluence of the Rivers
   Ouse and Foss. The York urban area has a population of 137,505 whilst
   the entire unitary authority (see below) has a population of 184,900.
   Its geographic coordinates are 53°57′N 1°05′W.

   York is the traditional county town of Yorkshire, to which it lends its
   name. However, it did not form part of any of the three historic
   divisions of Yorkshire; known as ridings.

   Traditionally the term City of York was reserved for the area within
   the city walls (a small area outside of the walls, the Ainsty, was
   often associated with the City, resulting in the term the City and
   Ainsty of York), but the modern City of York, created on April 1, 1996,
   is much larger. It is a unitary authority, and apart from York itself,
   includes several neighbouring parishes which formerly belonged to the
   surrounding districts of Harrogate, Ryedale and Selby. It borders on
   North Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire.

   York is home to the University of York founded in 1963, and York St
   John University which gained university status in 2006.

   The city often suffers from flooding.

History

   The name 'York' has an interesting etymological history, ultimately
   deriving from the Latin name for the city, Eboracum. The city was
   founded in AD 71, and has a rich Roman and Viking history, acting as
   capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior. It later became
   the seat of the Archbishop of York, whose province of York covers
   northern England, and acted as the centre for the Viking kingdom of
   Jorvik.

   The historical aspects of York attract a great deal of tourism, the
   jewel in the crown being the city's historic cathedral church, York
   Minster.

Geography

   York lies within the Vale of York, and is generally said to be a fairly
   flat area of land with an unusual amount of green space. The ings are
   flood meadows along the River Ouse, while the strays are scattered
   around the city in marshy, low-lying places; the Knavesmire is part of
   Micklegate Stray.

   York is situated at the confluence of two rivers, the Ouse and the
   Foss. During Roman times, the land surrounding the rivers was very
   marshy, making it easier to defend. The city is prone to severe
   flooding from the River Ouse, and has an extensive (but not always
   effective) network of flood defences. These include walls along the
   Ouse, and a barrier across the River Foss where it joins the Ouse. The
   floods of late October and early November 2000, which were the highest
   for over 350 years, caused much damage, but the water did not breach
   the (sandbag reinforced) flood walls. Much land within the city has
   always been too flood-prone for development.

   York railway station is situated on the East Coast, Cross Country and
   Transpennine mainlines.

Demographics

   The population of York stands at 184,900 .

   York's economy is based largely on tourism and other service-based
   industries. This is very different from the position as recently as the
   1950s, when York's prosperity was based on chocolate manufacturing and
   the railways. Most of the industry around the railway has gone,
   including the carriage works which once employed some 22,000 men. Major
   employers now include City of York Council, Norwich Union, Card
   Protection Plan and Nestlé, amongst others.

   York is the headquarters of the confectionery manufacturer Nestlé
   Rowntree, and home to the KitKat, Smarties and eponymous Yorkie bar
   chocolate brands. Terry's chocolate factory, makers of the Chocolate
   Orange, was also located in the city; but it closed on 30 September
   2005, when production was moved by its owners, Kraft Foods, to Poland.
   However, the historic factory building can still be seen, situated next
   to the Knavesmire racecourse.

   On the edge of York, the University of York and its Science Park
   contribute heavily to the skilled-work sector of the economy.

Job losses in 2006

   It was announced on the 20 September 2006 that Nestlé would be cutting
   645 jobs at the Rowntree's chocolate factory in York. This came after a
   number of other job losses in the city at Norwich Union, British Sugar
   and Terry's chocolate factory.

Law and government

   York is an ancient borough, and was one of the boroughs reformed by the
   Municipal Corporations Act 1835 to form a municipal borough. It gained
   the status of a county borough in 1889, under the Local Government Act
   1888, and existed so until 1974, when, under the Local Government Act
   1972, it became a non-metropolitan district in the county of North
   Yorkshire.

   In the 1990s UK local government reform, York became one of the many
   boroughs to regain unitary status, but was the only one to see a
   substantial alteration in its borders, taking in parts of Selby and
   Harrogate districts, and about half the population of Ryedale district.
   Unsurprising this caused tension with its neighbours. Ironically, this
   boundary had not been the intention of the council and it was only
   floated after the council's preferred option of a unitary bounded by
   the A64/A1237 ringroad was rejected by the central Government.

   York has 22 wards, which elect between 1 and 3 councillors each, for a
   total of 47 councillors. The council is controlled by the Liberal
   Democrats, who have 29 councillors. There are 15 Labour Party
   councillors, 2 Greens, and one independent.

   The city has its own magistrates and crown courts. It is home to the
   North Yorkshire Police Force.

   York is twinned with:
     * France Dijon, France
     * Ghana Fanteakwa, Ghana
     * Germany Münster, Germany

Education

   The University of York, on the edge of the city, is regularly placed in
   the top 10 UK Universities. Until 2006 it was York's only institution
   with university status, when York St John University College, formerly
   an autonomous college of University of Leeds, attained full university
   status as York St John University. The city also hosts a branch of the
   College of Law.

   The city has two major Further Education institutions: one, York
   College, which is currently in the process of being moved to a brand
   new site, and a second at Askham Bryan.

   York College is an amalgamation of York Technical College and York
   Sixth Form College. Students there study a very wide range of academic
   and vocational courses, and range from school leavers and sixth formers
   to people training to make career moves. It also runs many courses in
   the community.

   Askham Bryan College offers many further education course, foundation
   and honours degrees, specialising in more vocational subjects such as
   Horticulture, Agriculture, Animal Management and even Golf Course
   Management.

   There are over 55 schools in the City of York area. The Local Education
   Authority is the City of York Council, who manage most Primary and
   Secondary Schools within the city. About 40 Primary schools cover
   education from ages 5-11, with some offering early years education from
   age three. From 11-16 education is then provided by 11 Secondary
   school, four of which offer additional education up to age 18.

   York also has several private schools. St Peter's is famous for
   schooling the infamous Guy Fawkes (so they never put the guy on their
   bonfire!). Two others have Quaker origins, Bootham School is co-ed and
   The Mount is all-girls. On the outskirts of the city is Queen Margarets
   School.

   The Shambles is perhaps York's most iconic street. Formerly the
   lamb-butchers district, it retains an historic feel. It contains the
   shrine of Margaret Clitherow, and many gift shops. York has many other
   narrow streets and passages, commonly known as Snickelways.

   The city has many museums, including the Castle Museum, Yorkshire
   Museum & Gardens, Richard III Museum and the York Dungeon. The National
   Railway Museum is situated just behind the station, and is home to the
   largest static collection of railway locomotives in the world,
   including the world's fastest steam locomotive LNER 4468 Mallard.

   York is also a major venue for horse racing at York Racecourse in the
   Knavesmire area, and every year, thousands flock to the city for the
   Ebor Handicap Meeting in August.

   York is also noted for its wealth of churches and pubs. Many of the
   remaining churches in York are from the medieval period. The York area
   is said to contain one pub for every day of the year, and that in York
   there is no point within the city walls where one can stand and not be
   able to see at least one pub and at least one church. These claims
   although commonly quoted are exaggerated.

Sports

   The City's football team is York City F.C. who play in the Nationwide
   Conference. York also has a rugby league side, York City Knights and an
   open rowing club (York city rowing club) located underneath Lendal
   Bridge. The most notable sportsmen to come form York in recent years
   are footballers Marco Gabbiadini and Steve McClaren, who both attended
   Nunthorpe Grammar School. Steve McClaren has since gone onto Football
   management at several clubs including Middlesbrough and has been
   appointed to the post of England Manager in 2006.

Quaker involvement in the city

   York has a long association with the Religious Society of Friends. The
   York-born Quaker chocolate entrepreneurs and social reformers Joseph
   Rowntree and Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree left an indelible mark on the
   city, through both their business interests and their philanthropy.
   They built the village of New Earswick to provide quality affordable
   housing for their employees. They also founded two Quaker schools,
   Bootham School and The Mount, and contributed in large part to the
   building of York Public Library and the creation of Rowntree Park. The
   four Rowntree trusts, funded from the Rowntree legacies, are based in
   York.

   The Retreat is a large Quaker mental hospital, situated in the east of
   the city outside the city walls. It was founded in 1796 by William
   Tuke; over the next century his son Henry Tuke, grandson Samuel Tuke
   and great-grandson Daniel Hack Tuke also devoted themselves to mental
   health reform, continuing to reform The Retreat and publishing a number
   of works on the subject. Another notable York Quaker was the sculptor
   Austin Wright.
