   Many; see text.

   The swifts are birds superficially similar to swallows but are actually
   not closely related to those passerine species at all; swifts are in
   the separate order Apodiformes, which they formerly shared with the
   hummingbirds.

   The resemblances between the swifts and swallows are due to convergent
   evolution reflecting similar life styles based on catching insects in
   flight.

   The family scientific name comes from the Greek απους, apous, meaning
   "without feet", since swifts have very short legs and never settle
   voluntarily on the ground, perching instead on vertical surfaces. The
   tradition of depicting swifts without feet continued into the Middle
   Ages, as seen in the heraldic martlet.

   Swifts are the most aerial of birds and some, like the Common Swift,
   even sleep and mate on the wing. Larger species, such as white-throated
   needletail, are amongst the fastest flyers in the animal kingdom. One
   group, the Swiftlets or Cave Swiftlets have developed a form of
   echolocation for navigating through dark cave systems where they roost.
   One species, Aerodramus papuensis has recently been discovered to use
   this navigation at night outside its cave roost also.

   Like swallows and martins, the swifts of temperate regions are strongly
   migratory and winter in the tropics.

   Many swifts have a characteristic shape, with a short forked tail and
   very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang. The
   flight of some species is characterised by a distinctive "flicking"
   action quite different from swallows.

   The nest of many species is glued to a vertical surface with saliva,
   and the genus Aerodramus use only that substance, which is the basis
   for bird's nest soup.

Systematics and evolution

   The treeswifts are closely related to the true swifts, but form a
   separate family, the Hemiprocnidae.

   In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the old order Apodiformes is split.
   Swifts remain in that order, but hummingbirds are put into a new order,
   Trochiliformes. Given the discovery of the Jungornithidae which were
   apparently swift-like hummingbird relatives, and of primitive
   hummingbirds such as Eurotrochilus, this seems hardly warranted.

   The taxonomy of this group is in general complicated, with genus and
   species boundaries widely disputed, especially amongst the swiftlets.
   Analysis of behaviour and vocalizations is marred by common parallel
   evolution, while analyses of different morphological traits and of
   various DNA sequences have yielded equivocal and partly contradictory
   results (Thomassen et al., 2005).

   The Apodiformes diversified during the Eocene, at the end of which the
   extant families were present; fossil genera are known from all over
   temperate Europe, between today's Denmark and France, such as the
   primitive Scaniacypselus (Early - Middle Eocene) and the more modern
   Procypseloides (Late Eocene/Early Oligocene - Early Miocene). A
   prehistoric genus sometimes assigned to the swifts, Primapus (Early
   Eocene of England), might also be a more distant ancestor.
