   Body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet Index is a statistical measure of the
   weight of a person scaled according to height. It was invented between
   1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet during the
   course of developing "social physics".

Calculation

   BMI is defined as the individual's body weight divided by the square of
   the height, and is almost always expressed in the unit kg / m^2, which
   is therefore often left out. The BMI value can be calculated with the
   following formulae.

   SI units Imperial units
   \mathrm{BMI} = \frac{\mathit{weight} \ \mathrm{(kg)}}{\mathit{height}^2
   (\mathrm{m})} \mathrm{BMI} = 703 \frac{\mathit{weight} \
   (\mathrm{lb})}{\mathit{height}^2 \ (\mathrm{in})}

   When calculating BMI, using SI units is preferred.

Usage

   The BMI has become controversial because many people, including
   physicians, have come to rely on it for medical diagnosis - but that
   has never been the BMI's purpose. It is meant to be used as a simple
   means of classifying sedentary (physically inactive) individuals with
   an average body composition. For these individuals, the current value
   settings are as follows: a BMI of 18.5 to 25 may indicate optimal
   weight; a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person is underweight while
   a number above 25 may indicate the person is overweight; a BMI below 15
   may indicate the person has an eating disorder; a number above 30
   suggests the person is obese (over 40, morbidly obese).

   In physiology the term “ weight” is used interchangeably with the “
   mass”. For a given body shape and given density, the BMI will be
   proportional to height e.g. if all body dimensions increase by 50%, the
   BMI increases by 50%.

   Generally, a BMI chart displays calculated BMI as a function of weight
   (horizontal axis) and height (vertical axis) using “contour lines” for
   different values of BMI or colors for different BMI categories.

Accuracy

   The BMI is meant to broadly categorise populations for purely
   statistical purposes. As noted, its accuracy in relation to actual
   levels of body fat is easily distorted by such factors as fitness
   level, muscle mass, bone structure, gender, and ethnicity. People who
   are mesomorphic tend to have higher BMI numbers than people who are
   endomorphic, because they have greater bone mass and greater muscle
   mass, respectively, than do endomorphic individuals.

   Similarly, an ectomorphic individual could conceivably receive an
   unhealthily low reading, when in fact their body type makes them
   naturally thin no matter what they eat.

   People with short stature tend to have lower BMI. Therefore they should
   use a lower cut-off value for obesity diagnosis. The same applies to
   older people, whose reduced muscle mass can hide additional body fat
   without increasing BMI.

BMI categories

   A frequent use of the BMI is to acess how much an individual's body
   weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or
   her height. The weight excess or deficiency may, in part, be accounted
   for by body fat ( adipose tissue) although other factors such as
   muscularity also affect BMI (see discussion below and overweight).
   Human bodies rank along the index from around 15 (near starvation) to
   over 40 (morbidly obese). This statistical spread is usually described
   in broad categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese and
   morbidly obese. The particular BMI values used to demarcate these
   categories varies based on the authority, but typically a BMI of less
   than 18.5 is considered underweight and may indicate malnutrition, an
   eating disorder, or other health problems, while a BMI greater than 25
   is considered overweight and above 30 is considered obese. These ranges
   of BMI values are valid only when applied to adults.

Thresholds

   Given the reservations detailed below concerning the limitations of the
   BMI as a diagnostic tool for individuals, the following are common
   definitions of BMI categories:

          + Starvation: less than 15
          + Underweight: less than 18.5
          + Ideal: from 18.5 to 25
          + Overweight: from 25 to 30
          + Obese: from 30 to 40
          + Morbidly Obese: greater than 40

   The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 1994
   indicates that 59% of American men and 49% of women have BMIs over 25.
   Extreme obesity — a BMI of 40 or more — was found in 2% of the men and
   4% of the women. There are differing opinions on the threshold for
   being underweight in females, doctors quote anything from 18.5 to 20 as
   being the lowest weight, the most frequently stated being 19. A BMI
   nearing 15 is usually used as an indicator for starvation and the
   health risks involved, with a BMI <17.5 being one of the DSM criteria
   for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.

BMI-for-age

   BMI is used differently for children. It is calculated the same way as
   for adults, but then compared to typical values for other children of
   the same age. Instead of set thresholds for underweight and overweight,
   then, the BMI percentile allows comparison with children of the same
   gender and age. A BMI that is less than the 5th percentile is
   considered underweight and above the 95th percentile is considered
   overweight. Children with a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile
   are considered to be at risk of becoming overweight.

   Recent studies in England have indicated that females between the ages
   12 and 16 have a higher BMI than males by 1.0 kg/m² on average.

International variations

   These recommended distinctions along the liner scale may vary from time
   to time and country to country, making global, longitudinal surveys
   problematic. In 1998, the U.S. National Institutes of Health brought
   U.S. definitions into line with World Health Organization guidelines,
   lowering the normal/overweight cut-off from BMI 27.8 to BMI 25. This
   had the effect of redefining approximately 30 million Americans,
   previously "technically healthy" to "technically overweight". It also
   recommends lowering the normal/overweight threshold for South East
   Asian body types to around BMI 23, and expects further revisions to
   emerge from clinical studies of different body types.

   For Asians, the new cut-off BMI index for obesity is 27.5 compared with
   the traditional WHO figure of 30. An Asian adult with a BMI of 23 or
   greater is now considered overweight and the ideal normal range is
   18.5-22.9. Singapore BMI Cut-offs.

Applications

Statistical device

   The Body Mass Index is generally used as a means of correlation between
   groups related by general mass and can serve as a basic means of
   estimating adiposity. However, the duality of the Body Mass Index is
   that, whilst easy-to-use as a general calculation, it is limited in how
   accurate and pertinent the data obtained from it can be. Generally, the
   Index is suitable for recognising trends within sedentary or overweight
   individuals because there is a smaller margin for errors.

   This general correlation is particularly useful for consensus data
   regarding obesity or various other conditions because it can be used to
   build a semi-accurate representation from which a solution can be
   stipulated, or the RDA for a group can be calculated. Similarly, this
   is becoming more and more pertinent to the growth of children, due to
   the majority of their exercise habits.

   The growth of children is usually documented against a BMI-measured
   growth chart. Obesity trends can be calculated from the difference
   between the child's BMI and the BMI on the chart. However, this method
   again falls prey to the obstacle of body composition: many children who
   are generally born, or grow as an endomorph, would be classed as obese
   despite body composition. Clinical professionals should take into
   account the child's body composition and defer to an appropriate
   technique such as densiometry.

Clinical practice

   BMI can be calculated quickly and without expensive equipment. However,
   BMI categories do not take into account factors such as frame size and
   muscularity. The categories also fail to account for varying
   proportions of muscle, fat, bone & cartilage, and water weight.

   Despite this, BMI categories are generally regarded as a satisfactory
   tool for measuring whether sedentary individuals are "underweight,"
   "overweight" or "obese." It has been used by the WHO as the standard
   for recording obesity statistics since the early 1980s. In the United
   States, BMI is also used as a measure of underweight, owing to advocacy
   on behalf of those suffering with eating disorders, such as anorexia
   nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

   Individuals who are not sedentary - especially athletes - as well as
   children, the elderly, the infirm, and individuals who are naturally
   endomorphic or ectomorphic (i.e., people who don't have a medium frame)
   are ill-fitted to assessment using the BMI. Or to state the problem
   more accurately, the BMI measurements at which these people may be
   underweight, overweight or obese are different from sedentary
   mesomorphs whose ages are between about 20 and 70.

   In athletes, the problem is that muscle is denser than fat. Most
   professional athletes are "overweight" or "obese" according to their
   BMI - unless the number at which they are considered "overweight" or
   "obese" is adjusted upward. In children and the elderly, differences in
   bone density and, thus, in the proportion of bone to total weight can
   mean the number at which these people are considered underweight should
   be adjusted downward.

   In all cases, methods for actually measuring body fat percentage are
   always preferable to BMI for measuring healthy body size.

Problems

   As a general rule, developed muscle is denser than fat and the BMI does
   not account for this. Therefore a person with more muscle mass, such as
   a body-builder, will seem to be overweight. Likewise it could be
   stipulated that some long-distance or endurance athletes would be
   classified as ectomorphic (underweight, anorexic or starvation), this
   type of athlete tends to have low body fat and well developed slow
   twitch muscle, which does not contribute greatly to muscle mass. These
   individuals could be widely regarded as the perfect composite for their
   particular sports. Due to these limitations, body composition for
   athletes would not be calculated using the body mass index, and instead
   the body fat would be determined by such techniques as skinfold
   measurements or underwater weighing. In parallel to this, sportsmen or
   women from sports such as Rugby, where size and muscle are often of
   importance, could be listed as overweight, due to a large amount of
   muscle. At the extreme, many bodybuilders would be classified as
   morbidly obese, such as Markus Rühl who has a BMI of 46.

   Another issue is that competitive athletes often know very accurately
   what their actual height and weight are, while the general public has
   tendencies toward over-estimating their height, and under-estimating
   their weight. The BMI standards, as a public health tool, take this
   tendency into account. This can lead to athletes having a higher
   reported BMI than a lay person of the same height and weight.

   Mayo Clinic researchers say the BMI doesn't accurately predict risk of
   cardiovascular death because it doesn't distinguish between muscle and
   fat. They say a better measure may be your Waist-hip ratio.

   In an analysis led by Lopez-Jiminez of 40 studies involving 250,000
   people, heart patients with normal BMIs were at higher risk of death
   from cardiovascular disease than people whose BMIs put them in the
   "obese" range.

   In fact, the ones in the study who had the highest death rates were
   people who weighed the least; in other words, they had the lowest BMIs.
