   Meitnerium ( IPA: /ˌmʌɪtˈnɛːriəm/), also called eka-iridium, is a
   chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Mt and
   atomic number 109. It is a synthetic element whose most stable isotope
   is Mt-276 with a half-life of 720 milliseconds.

History

   Meitnerium was first synthesized on August 29, 1982 by a German
   research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the
   Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft für
   Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt.
   The team bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of
   iron-58. The synthesis of this element demonstrated that nuclear fusion
   techniques could be used to make new, heavy nuclei.

   The name meitnerium was suggested in honour of the Austrian physicist
   and mathematician Lise Meitner, but there was an element naming
   controversy as to what the elements from 101 to 109 were to be called;
   thus IUPAC adopted unnilennium ( IPA: /ˌjuːnɪˈlɛniəm/, symbol Une) as a
   temporary, systematic element name. In 1997, however, the dispute was
   resolved and the current name was adopted.
