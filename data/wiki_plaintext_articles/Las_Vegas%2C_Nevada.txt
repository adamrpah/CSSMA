   Las Vegas (often informally abbreviated to "Vegas") is the most
   populous city in the state of Nevada, United States, the seat of Clark
   County, and an internationally known vacation, shopping, entertainment,
   and gambling destination. It was established in 1905 and officially
   became a city in 1911. It is the largest U.S. city founded in the 20th
   century.

   The name Las Vegas is often applied to the unincorporated areas of
   Clark County that surround the city, especially the resort areas on and
   near the Las Vegas Strip. This 4½  mi (7.2  km) stretch of Las Vegas
   Boulevard is mostly outside the Las Vegas city limits, in the
   unincorporated town of Paradise.

   The centre of gambling in the United States, Las Vegas is marketed as
   The Entertainment Capital of the World, also commonly known as Sin City
   or Vice City, due to the popularity of legalized gambling, availability
   of alcoholic beverages at any time (as is true throughout Nevada), and
   various forms and degrees of adult entertainment. The city's glamorous
   image has made it a popular setting for films and television programs.

History

Founding

   Las Vegas (English: "The Meadows" or "The Grasslands") was given its
   name by Spaniards in the Antonio Armijo party, who used the water in
   the area while heading north and west along the Old Spanish Trail from
   Texas. In the 1800s, areas of the Las Vegas Valley contained artesian
   wells that supported extensive green areas or Meadows (Vega in
   Spanish), hence the name Las Vegas. John C. Frémont traveled into the
   Las Vegas Valley on May 3, 1844, while it was still part of Mexico. He
   was a leader of a group of scientists, scouts and observers for the
   United States Army Corps of Engineers. On May 10, 1855, following
   annexation by the United States, Brigham Young assigned 30 Mormon
   missionaries led by William Bringhurst to the area to convert the
   Paiute Indian population. A fort was built near the current downtown
   area, serving as a stopover for travelers along the " Mormon Corridor"
   between Salt Lake and the briefly thriving Mormon colony at San
   Bernardino, California. Las Vegas was established as a railroad town on
   May 15, 1905, when 110 acres (44.5 ha) owned by Montana Senator William
   A. Clark's San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City Railroad, was
   auctioned off in what is now downtown Las Vegas. Las Vegas was part of
   Lincoln County until 1909 when it became part of the newly established
   Clark County. Las Vegas became an incorporated city on March 16, 1911
   when it adopted its first charter.

Major events

   Las Vegas is one of the most dynamic cities in the world, "reinventing"
   itself as a gambling mecca, family destination, capital of hedonism
   ("What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"), or hotspot for dining and
   shopping over the years. Several events stand out as turning points:
     * The floods of 1955, 1984, 1999, and 2003.
     * Establishment of Las Vegas as a railroad town ( May 15, 1905).
     * Legalization of gambling ( March 19, 1931).
     * Completion of Hoover Dam ( October 9, 1936).
     * Opening of Bugsy Siegel's Flamingo Hotel on what would become the
       Las Vegas Strip ( December 26, 1946).
     * Atmospheric nuclear testing ( 1951 to 1962).
     * The first Strip property " The El Rancho" was consumed by fire on
       July 17, 1960.
     * Elvis Presley returns to live performances in August 31, 1969 by
       opening the International Hotel
     * MGM Grand Hotel fire the worst disaster in Nevada history on (
       November 21, 1980).
     * A series of explosions destroys the PEPCON rocket fuel plant and
       nearby Kidd and Co. marshmallow factory (May 4, 1988)
     * Opening of The Mirage which began the era of megaresort casinos on
       ( November 22, 1989).
     * The Dunes became the first Strip property to be imploded on October
       27, 1993.
     * 100th birthday, or Centennial, of Las Vegas ( May 15, 2005).

Economic history

   Las Vegas started as a stopover on the pioneer trails to the west and
   became a popular railroad town in the early 1900s. It was a staging
   point for all the mines in the surrounding area, especially those
   around the town of Bullfrog, that shipped their goods out to the rest
   of the country. With the growth of the railroads, Las Vegas became less
   important, but the completion of the nearby Hoover Dam resulted in
   substantial growth in tourism, which, along with the legalization of
   gambling, led to the advent of the casino-hotels for which Las Vegas is
   famous.

   The constant stream of tourist dollars from the hotels and casinos was
   augmented by a new source of federal money. This money came from the
   establishment of what is now Nellis Air Force Base. The influx of
   military personnel and casino job-hunters helped start a land building
   boom which still goes on today..

   The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department provides most law
   enforcement services in the city and surrounding county. Exceptions
   include cities with their own law enforcement agency; including North
   Las Vegas, Henderson and Boulder City.

   Most of the people and businesses who live in what they call "Las
   Vegas" are actually residents of neighboring unincorporated communities
   or incorporated cities. In fact, of the over 1.7 million people who
   live in the Las Vegas valley, only 575,973 live inside Las Vegas city
   limits. The largest suburbs are Paradise (188,768) between Las Vegas
   and Henderson (224,829), Sunrise Manor (184,801) east of Las Vegas and
   North Las Vegas, and Spring Valley (161,286) southwest of Las Vegas.
   Paradise, Sunrise Manor, and Spring Valley are unincorporated
   townships, while Henderson and North Las Vegas are incorporated. The
   earliest, Paradise, formed during a 1940s water dispute between the
   City of Las Vegas and early homeowners south of San Francisco Street,
   now Sahara Avenue.

   The City of Las Vegas government operates as a council-manager
   government. The Mayor sits as a Councilmember-At-Large and presides
   over all of the City Council meetings. In the event that the Mayor
   cannot preside over a City Council meeting, the Mayor Pro-Tem is the
   presiding officer of the meeting until such time as the Mayor returns
   to his seat. The City Manager is responsible for the administration and
   the day-to-day operation of all of the municipal services and city
   departments. The City Manager also maintains intergovernmental
   relationships with federal, state, county and other local governments.

   A Paiute Indian reservation occupies about 1 acre (4000 m²) in the
   downtown area of Las Vegas.

Geography

   Las Vegas is located at 36°11′39″N, 115°13′19″W (36.194168,
   115.222060)^GR1. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city
   has a total area of 340.0 km² (131.3 mi²). 339.8 km² (131.2 mi²) of it
   is land and 0.16 km² (0.1 mi²) of it (0.04%) is water.

   The city is located in an arid basin surrounded by mountains varying in
   colour from pink to rust to gray. The Spring Mountains lie to the west.
   As befits a desert, much of the landscape is rocky and dusty. Within
   the city, however, there are a great deal of lawns, trees, and other
   greenery. Due to water resource issues, there is now a movement to
   encourage xeriscaping instead of lawns. Another part of the water
   conservation efforts include scheduled watering groups for watering
   residential landscaping.

Climate

   Las Vegas' climate is typical of the Mojave Desert, in which it is
   located, marked with hot summers, mild winters, abundant sunshine
   year-round, and very little rainfall. High temperatures in the 90s °F
   are common in the months of May, June, and September and temperatures
   normally exceed 100 °F (38 °C) most days in the months of July and
   August, with very low humidity, frequently under 10%. The hottest
   temperature ever recorded is 117 °F (47 °C) set twice, on July 19,
   2005, at McCarran International Airport and July 24, 1942, at
   present-day Nellis Air Force Base. Winters are cool and windy, with the
   majority of Las Vegas' annual 4.49  in (114  mm) of rainfall coming
   from January to March. Winter daytime highs are normally around 60 °F
   (16 °C) and winter nighttime lows are usually around 40 °F (4 °C). The
   coldest temperature ever recorded is 8 °F (-13 °C) set on January 25,
   1937, at present-day Nellis Air Force Base. Showers occur less
   frequently in the Spring or Autumn. July through September, the Mexican
   Monsoon often brings enough moisture from the Gulf of California across
   Mexico and into the southwest to cause afternoon and evening
   thunderstorms. Although winter snow is usually visible from December to
   May on the mountains surrounding Las Vegas, it rarely snows in the city
   itself.

   Las Vegas has been the county seat of Clark County since the formation
   of the county in 1909. The Census Bureau's official population estimate
   as of 2005 was 545,147. The city’s Planning and Development Department
   reported an increase of 41,126 in 2005, for a total population of
   575,973. . Recent figures place the population for the Las Vegas
   metropolitan area, which includes all of Clark County, at over 1.6
   million people ( 2004 ), and the region is one of the fastest growing
   in the United States. Las Vegas was ranked as the 29th largest city in
   the United States in 2000, but recent estimates suggest that the city's
   population has since surpassed that of Atlanta, Nashville, Washington,
   D.C., Louisville, Denver and Boston to place it 22nd in rank. It is
   likely to surpass Milwaukee and possibly a few other cities to reach
   the top 20 by the time of the 2010 Census.

   As of the census^ GR2 of 2000, there were 478,434 people, 176,750
   households, and 117,538 families residing in the city. The population
   density was 1,630.3/km² (4,222.5/mi²). There are 190,724 housing units
   at an average density of 649.9/km² (1,683.3/mi²). The racial makeup of
   the city was 69.86% White, 10.36% African American, 0.75% Native
   American, 4.78% Asian, 0.45% Pacific Islander, 9.75% from other races,
   and 4.05% from two or more races. 23.61% of the population is Hispanic
   or Latino of any race.

   There were 176,750 households out of which 31.9% had children under the
   age of 18 living with them, 48.3% were married couples living together,
   12.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.5% were
   non-families. 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals and
   7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The
   average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.20.

   In the city the population was spread out with 25.9% under the age of
   18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 32.0% from 25 to 44, 21.7% from 45 to 64, and
   11.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years.
   For every 100 females there were 103.3 males. For every 100 females age
   18 and over, there were 102.5 males.

   The median income for a household in the city was $44,069, and the
   median income for a family was $50,465. Males had a median income of
   $35,511 versus $27,554 for females. The per capita income for the city
   was $22,060. About 8.6% of families and 11.9% of the population were
   below the poverty line, including 15.4% of those under age 18 and 8.3%
   of those age 65 or over.

   As of the 2004 census estimate, the Las Vegas metropolitan area
   contained over 1.6 million residents, and contains the largest ethnic
   Hawaiian community outside of Hawaii.

Education

   Primary public education is provided by the Clark County School
   District (CCSD), which is the fifth largest school district in the
   nation.

   Las Vegas does not have any independent four-year university within its
   city limits. The University of Nevada, Las Vegas is located in
   Paradise, three miles south of the city limits. The University of
   Nevada Medical School has a campus near downtown Las Vegas. Several
   national colleges, including the University of Phoenix, have campuses
   in the Las Vegas area. Nevada State College and Touro University Nevada
   are both located in nearby Henderson. The Community College of Southern
   Nevada has campuses in Las Vegas, North Las Vegas and Henderson

Environmental features

   Las Vegas is situated on the arid floor within Clark County.
   Correspondingly the environment is dominated by desert vegetation and
   wildlife; however, the setting is also subject to torrential flash
   floods which the infrastructure of storm sewers has not been able to
   contain. The rapid pace of urban development beginning in the 1980s has
   produced more impervious surface and exacerbated the inherent flooding
   issue. Enabling the rapid population expansion was a major addition to
   the city's sewage treatment capacity, an event removing a major
   constraint to population growth in the 1970s. The Sewage treatment
   expansion resulted from a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant
   funded 208 program to analyse and forecast growth and environmental
   impacts through the year 2010.

Economy

   Enlarge
   Interior of a casino. A major part of the city economy is based on
   tourism, including gambling.

   The primary drivers of the Las Vegas economy have been the confluence
   of tourism, gaming, and conventions which in turn feed the retail and
   dining industries. Several companies involved in the manufacture of
   electronic gaming machines, such as slot machines, are located in the
   Las Vegas area. In the 2000s retail and dining have become attractions
   of their own.

   Tourism marketing and promotion are handled by the Las Vegas Convention
   and Visitors Authority, a county wide agency. Its annual Visitors
   Survey provides detailed information on visitor numbers, spending
   patterns and resulting revenues .

   Las Vegas as the county seat and home to the Lloyd D. George Federal
   District Courthouse, draws numerous legal service industries providing
   bail, marriage, divorce, tax, incorporation and other legal services.

   The redevelopment listed below shows how the city is trying to
   diversify the local economy and revitalize the downtown area. The World
   Market Centre is an example of this.

City redevelopment

   When The Mirage, the first Megaresort, opened in 1989, it started a
   movement of people and construction away from downtown Las Vegas to the
   Las Vegas Strip. This resulted in a drop in tourism from which the
   downtown area is still trying to recover.

   A concerted effort has been made by city officials to diversify the Las
   Vegas economy from tourism by attracting light manufacturing, banking,
   and other commercial interests. The lack of any state individual or
   corporate income tax and very simple incorporation requirements have
   fostered the success of this effort.

   Having been late to develop an urban core of any substantial size, Las
   Vegas has retained very affordable real estate prices in comparison to
   nearby urban centers. Consequently, the city has recently enjoyed an
   enormous boom both in population and in tourism. However, as a New York
   Times series on the city reported in 2004, the median price of housing
   in the Las Vegas Valley is now at or above the nationwide median. The
   urban area has grown outward so quickly that it is beginning to run
   into Bureau of Land Management holdings along its edges, increasing
   land values enough that medium- and high-density development is
   beginning to occur closer to the core.

   As a reflection of the city's rapid growing population, the new
   Chinatown of Las Vegas was constructed in the early 1990s on Spring
   Mountain Road. Chinatown initially consisted of only one large shopping
   centre complex, but the area was recently expanded for new shopping
   centers that contain various Asian businesses.

   With the Strip expansion in the 1990s, downtown Las Vegas began to
   suffer. The Fremont Street Experience (FSE) was built in an effort to
   draw tourists downtown. While greatly slowing the decline, it did not
   stop the decline in tourism and revenue. The multi-level Neonopolis,
   complete with 11 theaters (managed by Galaxy Theaters, Inc.), was built
   to offer more retail and services downtown. While there have been
   changes in ownership and management, Neonopolis has not been able to
   lease all the space available. As of May 2006, the property has been
   sold and is under new management. Renovations are under-way to
   revitalize Neonopolis. Look for new restaurants to open in the late
   summer to early fall of 2006.

   In the early 2000s, some promising signs emerged for downtown Las
   Vegas. The city successfully lured the Internal Revenue Service to move
   operations from the far west of the city to a new building downtown
   that opened in April 2005. The IRS is expected to create a demand for
   additional businesses in the area, epecially in the daytime hours.

   The city purchased 61  acres (247,000 m²) of property from Union
   Pacific Railroad in 1995 with the goal of creating something that would
   draw tourists and locals to the downtown area. In 2004 Las Vegas Mayor
   Oscar Goodman announced plans for the Union Park Development which will
   include residential and office high-rises, The Lou Ruvo Brain
   Institute, an academic medical centre, The Smith Centre for the
   Performing Arts, and a new City Hall. After failed negotiations with
   The Related Co. on the development of Union Park in October of 2005,
   San Diego-based Newland Communities was chosen by the city as the new
   development firm. The Newland contract calls for Dan Van Epp, Newland's
   regional vice president and former president of the Howard Hughes
   Corp., to oversee his company's work on Union Park. The Lou Ruvo Brain
   Institute is expected to be completed in 2007.

   Along with the Union Park Development, other promising residential and
   office developments have begun construction around downtown Las Vegas.
   New condominium and hotel high rise projects have changed the entire
   Las Vegas skyline dramatically in recent years. Many large high-rise
   projects are planned for downtown Las Vegas as well as the Las Vegas
   Strip. It is expected that high-rise condominium development will
   transform the downtown area into a vibrant urban centre.

   The city council of Las Vegas has agreed on zoning changes on Fremont
   Street, which allows bars to be closer together duplicating efforts of
   similar cities, like the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego. It is expected
   that this change will bring more tourism and business to the downtown
   area.

   In 2005, on a lot adjacent to the city's 61 ac (247,000 m²), the World
   Market Centre opened. It is intended to be the nation's and possibly
   the world's preeminent furniture wholesale showroom and marketplace,
   and is meant to compete with the current furniture market capital of
   High Point, North Carolina.

   In 2004, the city partnered with Cheetah Wireless Technologies and
   MeshNetwork to pilot a wide area mobile broadband system. The pilot
   system is installed downtown, around the Fremont Street Experience.

   On October 23, 2006, plans were unveiled to build a World Jewelry
   Center in Downtown's Union Park. Similar to the World Market Centre,
   the WJC will be a one stop shop for jewelry trade shows from around the
   world. The project proposes a 57-story, 815-foot office tower.

Technology business development

   Although there are large hospitality and gaming industires in Las
   Vegas, many technology companies are either being relocated to Las
   Vegas or are created there. For various reasons, Las Vegas has had a
   high concentration of technology companies in electronic gaming and
   telecommunications industries.

   Some companies started in Las Vegas but since sold or relocated are:
     * Westwood Studios (sold to Electronic Arts)
     * Systems Research & Development (Sold to IBM)
     * Yellowpages.com (Sold to Bellsouth and SBC)
     * MPower Communications

   Some current technology companies in southern Nevada are:
     * Bigelow Aerospace
     * CommPartners
     * Datanamics
     * eVital Communications
     * Petroglyph Games
     * SkywireMedia
     * Switch Communications
     * WorldDoc
     * Zappos

Transportation

   The CAT Bus is a popular means of public transportation among locals
   and tourists with various bus routes covering a large portion of the
   valley. The CAT system carries approximately 175,000 people per
   weekday, or about 10 percent of the valley's population.

   The Las Vegas Monorail runs from the MGM Grand Hotel at the south end
   of the Strip to the Sahara Hotel at the north end of the Strip.

   The street numbering system is divided by the following streets:
     * Westcliff Drive, US-95 Expressway, Fremont Street and Charleston
       Boulevard divides the north-south block numbers from west to east.
     * Las Vegas Boulevard divides the east-west streets from the Las
       Vegas Strip to near the Stratosphere, then Main Street becomes the
       dividing line from the Stratosphere to the North Las Vegas border,
       after which the Goldfield Street alignment officially divides east
       and west.

   The McCarran International Airport provides commercial flights into the
   Las Vegas valley. The airport also serves private aircraft, domestic
   and international passenger flights, and freight/cargo flights.
   Although general aviation traffic flies into McCarran International,
   other airstrips are available.

   Intercity bus service to Las Vegas is provided by traditional intercity
   bus carriers, including Greyhound; many charter services, including
   Green Tortoise; and several Chinatown bus lines.

   Primary roadways into and out of Las Vegas include I-15 (north towards
   Salt Lake City, Utah, and south towards San Diego, California and Los
   Angeles), US 93 (north towards Ely, Nevada and Jackpot, Nevada, and
   south towards Kingman, Arizona) and US 95 (north towards Reno and south
   towards Searchlight, Nevada), providing access to Interstates I-80 and
   I-40.

   Until 1997, the Amtrak Desert Wind train service ran through Las Vegas
   using the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) rails that run through the city;
   Amtrak service to Las Vegas has since been replaced by Amtrak's Thruway
   Motorcoach bus service. Plans to restore Los Angeles to Las Vegas
   Amtrak service using a Talgo train have been discussed since the Desert
   Wind was discontinued. As of 2006, however, no such service has been
   established.

   Union Pacific Railroad (UP) is the only class one railroad to provide
   rail freight service to the city.

   Some groups have proposed the California-Nevada Interstate Maglev line
   from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in order to ease the incoming and
   outgoing traffic congestion on I-15.

Attractions

   The major attractions in Vegas are the casinos. The most famous casinos
