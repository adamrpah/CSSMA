   Tropical Storm Odette was a rare out-of-season tropical storm that
   affected the Caribbean Sea in December of 2003. The fifteenth tropical
   storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season, Odette formed near the
   coast of Panama a few days after the official end of the Atlantic
   hurricane season, and ultimately made landfall on the Dominican
   Republic as a moderate tropical storm.

   The storm caused heavy damage throughout the Dominican Republic from
   unusually heavy rainfall in December. Preparation preceding Odette's
   landfall resulted in only 8 deaths and 14 injuries. Total damage is
   unknown, though crop damage in the Dominican Republic totaled to over
   $8 million (2003 USD, $8.8 million 2006 USD).

Storm history

   A cold front extended through the Caribbean Sea in late November. A low
   pressure area developed north of Panama on December 1, and as it
   drifted northeastward, it slowly organized. Convection organized with
   the approach of a tropical wave, and on December 4, Tropical Depression
   Twenty formed 345 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica. Generally favorable
   conditions for development continued, and the depression became
   Tropical Storm Odette later on the 4th.

   Odette strengthened in spite of being impacted by southwesterly shear,
   reaching its peak of 65 mph on December 6. The low-level circulation
   slowed down, while the storm's strong convection continued ahead of the
   storm. Because of this, the storm weakened slightly to a 60 mph
   tropical storm by the time it made landfall on Cabo Falso, Dominican
   Republic. It crossed the island, and upon reaching the Atlantic, lost
   much organization. On the 7th, Odette became extratropical, and
   continued northeast as an extratropical storm for two more days before
   dissipating.

Preparations

   Prior to Odette's predicted arrival, the Dominican Republic government
   issued for the evacuation of more than 10,000 people, mostly from those
   living near rivers. At least 2,000 shelters were set up, capable of
   housing up to 800,000 people. In addition, the government mobilized the
   army to force those unwilling to leave from their homes. Such
   precautions were taken due to already saturated grounds from heavy
   rainfall three weeks prior.

   A tropical storm watch was issued between Santo Domingo and the
   Dominican Republic/Haiti border on the 4th 56 hours prior to landfall.
   This was raised to a tropical storm warning on the 5th while 32 hours
   before landfall. In addition, tropical storm warning were issued for
   all of the Haitian coastline and Jamaica.

Impact

   While over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, Odette dropped heavy
   rainfall, including prior to its formation. For several days, the storm
   caused rains in Panama, Costa Rica, and the east coast of Nicaragua. In
   Colombia, the storm caused rainfall totals of up to 8 inches (200 mm)
   in Puerto Columbiana. In Jamaica, the storm dropped moderate rainfall,
   flooding several roads in Saint Ann and Saint Mary Parishes. Odette
   caused moderate damage and 8 deaths in the Dominican Republic.

   Winds from Tropical Storm Odette were relatively light across the
   Dominican Republic, with a peak gust of 60 mph occurring in Santo
   Domingo. The storm dropped heavy rainfall for several hours, amounting
   to a maximum of 9.07 inches (230 mm) in Isla Saona. Several other
   locations reported over 4 inches as well. The rainfall caused mudslides
   and flash flooding, forcing several rivers to overflow in combination
   with previous rains. In addition, a tornado was reported near Santo
   Domingo, destroying one house and uproofing several others.

   The flooding and mudslides damaged up to 60,000 homes and destroyed 34.
   Gusty winds caused power outages. River flooding caused two bridges to
   collapse, isolating several communities. Landslides buried several
   roads, though authorities quickly repaired them. The rainfall also
   flooded fields, resulting in severe crop damage. As much as 85% of the
   banana crop was lost, while the coffee crop suffered losses shortly
   before harvest season. Crop damage totaled to around $8 million (2003
   USD, $8.8 million 2006 USD). In addition, excess flooding contaminated
   water supplies, leaving several areas without clean water or
   sanitation.

   In all, Tropical Storm Odette caused 8 deaths and 14 injuries, mostly
   due to flash flooding and mudslides. In addition, two indirect deaths
   are associated with the storm due to heart attacks. Neighboring Haiti
   experienced little from the storm.

Puerto Rico and United States Virgin Islands

   Though Odette passed 280 miles to the west of Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico,
   the storm caused moderate rainfall across Puerto Rico and the United
   States Virgin Islands. Rainfall in Puerto Rico was heaviest in the
   southeast, where a peak of 8.73 inches was recorded in Jajome Alto. The
   storm also caused up to 2.2 inches of rainfall in Christiansted on
   Saint Croix.

   Odette's rainfall caused flooding throughout the island's rivers. The
   river flooding destroyed three bridges, resulting in $20,000 in damages
   (2003 USD). The flooding also caused a mudslide near a cemetery in
   Humacao. The rainfall also covered numerous roads, though overall
   damage was minimal throughout Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

Aftermath

   In all, 65,000 people were affected by Tropical Storm Odette. The
   Dominican Republic Red Cross and Red Crescent deployed 105 volunteers
   to the impacted areas, primarily in the area of Montecristi. The
   organization provided food and hygiene kits to thousands of people, as
   well as mosquito nets. The Red Cross also gave a 5,000 liter water tank
   for the citizens in Montecristi, an area without clean water or
   sanitation.

Records

   When Odette formed on December 4, it became the first tropical storm
   since the beginning of the modern tropical cyclone record to form in
   the Caribbean Sea in the month of December; a documented December
   Caribbean hurricane occurred in 1822 . However, Tropical Storm Karen,
   which formed in November of 1989, persisted until December while
   located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. In addition, Odette was the
   first Atlantic storm to form in the month of December since Hurricane
   Lili in 1984.

   The 2003 season was the first season since 1953 to have a pre-season
   storm and a post-season storm, with Ana in April and Odette.
