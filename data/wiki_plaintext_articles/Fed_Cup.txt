Fed Cup

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Sports events

   The Fed Cup (until 1995 Federation Cup) is the most important tennis
   tournament for female national teams, very similar to the men's Davis
   Cup. Both events are sanctioned by the International Tennis Federation.
   The chief difference between the 2 events used to be that the Fed Cup
   was typically contested in a much shorter period of time (2 weeks or
   less) whereas the Davis Cup is staggered over many months. Recently the
   format of the Fed Cup has been modified along the lines of the Davis
   Cup with one notable difference: each tie extends for only two days
   with doubles being the last rubber.

   The event was first held in 1963, the 50th anniversary of ITF, and has
   been held annually ever since.

   Arantxa Sánchez Vicario of Spain currently holds the record for the
   most singles and doubles wins in Fed Cup competition with 72 total
   victories and most years played (17).Israel's Anna Smashnova holds the
   records for most ties played (59)
