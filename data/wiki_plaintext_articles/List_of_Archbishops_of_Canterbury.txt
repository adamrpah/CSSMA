List of Archbishops of Canterbury

   This is a list of the Archbishops of Canterbury. The Archbishop of
   Canterbury is the head of the established Church of England and of the
   worldwide Anglican Communion.

   Until the first break between the Church of England and the Papal
   authority in 1534, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion
   with the Roman Catholic Church, which selected and consecrated them.
   After this the full communion was restored but then finally broken
   nearly 40 years later by the excommunication of Elizabeth I on April
   27, 1570. Since 1570, the Archbishop has been selected by the English
   (latterly British) monarch. Today, the choice is made in the name of
   the Sovereign by the Prime Minister, from a shortlist of two selected
   by an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission.

   Today, the Archbishop fills four main roles:
     * He is the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury, which
       covers the east of the County of Kent and the extreme north-east of
       Surrey. Founded by Augustine in 597, it is the oldest bishopric in
       the English church.
     * He is the metropolitan of the Province of Canterbury, encompassing
       30 dioceses in the southern two-thirds of England. The remaining 14
       dioceses in the north of England fall within the Province of York,
       under the aegis of the Archbishop of York. Four dioceses in Wales
       were under the Province of Canterbury until they were transferred
       to the disestablished Church in Wales in 1920.
     * As "Primate of All England", he is the chief religious figure in
       the Church of England (the British sovereign is the " Supreme
       governor" of the church).
     * As symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, the archbishop is
       recognized as primus inter pares ("first among equals") of all
       Anglican primates.
