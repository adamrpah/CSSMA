   Copenhagen ( IPA: [kəʊpənˈheɪgən], rhyming with pagan (the way the
   Danes themselves pronounce the name of the capital in English), or
   [kəʊpənˈhɑˑgən], with a as in spa; Danish København  IPA:
   [købn̩ˈhaʊˀn]) is the capital of Denmark and the country's largest city
   (metropolitan population 1,211,542 (2006)). It is also the name of the
   adjacent county. Copenhagen is the seat of the national parliament, the
   government, and the monarchy.

   The original designation for the city, from which the contemporary
   Danish name is derived, was Kjøbmandehavn, "merchants' harbour". The
   English name for the city is derived from its German name, Kopenhagen.
   The element hafnium is named after the city's Latin name, Hafnia.

Copenhagen municipality

   Copenhagen is one of three Danish municipalities that are not part of
   any county (that is, county functions are performed by the
   municipality), the others being the city of Frederiksberg (an enclave
   within Copenhagen itself) and the island of Bornholm. On 1 January
   2007, when the counties are to be replaced by fewer but larger
   "regions", Copenhagen will lose this special status and become an
   ordinary municipality within the new Region Hovedstaden (i.e. the
   Copenhagen Capital Region).

   The municipality covers a land area of 88 (total a. 91.3) km², and has
   a population of 501,000 (2006). Lord Mayor of Copenhagen is Ritt
   Bjerregaard, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne)
   political party, who is head of the Finance Committee. Other mayors are
   Martin Geertsen (Cultural and Recreational Committee), Bo Asmus
   Kjeldgaard (Education and Youth Committee), Mogens Lønborg (Health and
   Care Committee), Jakob Hougaard (Employment and Integration Committee),
   Klaus Bondam (Building and Environment Committee), and Mikkel Warming
   (Social Committee).

   The municipal seat of government is the Copenhagen City Hall (Rådhus).

   Neighboring municipalities are Gentofte, Gladsaxe and Herlev to the
   north, Rødovre and Hvidovre to the west, and Tårnby to the south.
   Frederiksberg is located as an enclave within the municipality, and is
   thus surrounded by Copenhagen.

   Copenhagen municipality will not be merged with other municipalities by
   January 1, 2007 as the result of nationwide Kommunalreformen ("The
   Municipal Reform" of 2007).

History of Copenhagen

   Copenhagen was founded around year 1000 by Sweyn I Forkbeard (Svend
   Tveskæg) and his son Canute the Great (Knud den Store). It was only a
   fishing village by the name of "Havn" (harbour) until the middle of the
   12th century when it grew in importance after coming into the
   possession of the Bishop Absalon, who fortified it in 1167. The
   excellent harbour encouraged Copenhagen's growth until it became an
   important centre of commerce (hence its name). It was repeatedly
   attacked by the Hanseatic League as the Germans took notice. In 1254,
   it received its charter as a city under Bishop Jakob Erlandsen.

   During 1658-59 it withstood a severe siege by the Swedes under Charles
   X. In 1801 a British fleet under Admiral Parker fought a major battle,
   the Battle of Copenhagen, with the Danish navy in Copenhagen harbour.
   It was during this battle Lord Nelson famously "put the telescope to
   the blind eye" in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to cease
   fire. When a British expeditionary force bombarded Copenhagen in 1807,
   to gain control of the Danish navy, the city suffered great damage and
   hundreds of people were killed. The reason why the devastation was so
   great was that Copenhagen relied on an old defence-line rendered
   virtually useless by the increase in shooting range available to the
   British. But not until the 1850's were the ramparts of the city opened
   to allow new housing to be built around the lakes ("Søerne") which
   bordered the old defence system to the west. This dramatic increase of
   space was long overdue, not only because the old ramparts were out of
   date as a defence system, but also because of bad sanitation in the old
   city. Before the opening, Copenhagen Centre was inhabited by
   approximately 125,000 people, peaking in the census of 1870 (140,000);
   today the figure is around 25,000. In 1901, Copenhagen expanded
   further, incorporating communities with 40,000 people, and in the
   process making Frederiksberg an enclave within Copenhagen.

   During World War II Copenhagen was occupied by German troops along with
   the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. In August
   1943, when the government's collaboration with the occupation forces
   collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbour by the Royal
   Danish Navy to prevent them being used by the Germans. The city has
   grown greatly since the war, in the seventies using the so-called
   five-finger-plan of commuter trainlines to surrounding towns and
   suburbs.

   Since the summer 2000, the cities of Copenhagen and Malmö have been
   connected by a toll bridge/tunnel ( Øresund Bridge), which allows both
   rail and road passengers to cross. It was inaugurated in July 2000 by
   King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. As a
   result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area
   which spans both nations. The construction of the bridge has led to a
   large number of changes to the public transportation system and the
   extensive redevelopment of Amager, south of the main city. The bridge
   has not yet been as widely used by motorists as was originally hoped,
   likely due to the high road tolls, allegedly slowing the planned
   integration of the region. Train passengers, however, are plentiful and
   increasing in numbers. The lack of a commonly acceptable currency
   throughout the area is another hindrance to the integration of the
   region, even though a growing number of shops, restaurants etc, if not
   usually encouraged, accept payment with either nation's currency in the
   other country.

Geography

Location

   Copenhagen is located on the eastern shore of the island of Zealand
   (Sjælland) and partly on the island of Amager. Copenhagen faces to the
   east the Øresund, the strait of water that separates Denmark from
   Sweden, and that connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea. On the
   Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen, lie the
   towns of Malmö and Landskrona.

   Copenhagen is also a part of the Øresund region, which consists of the
   eastern part of Zealand in Denmark and the western part of Scania in
   Sweden.

Population

   1,211,000 people live in metropolitan Copenhagen (Storkøbenhavn), a
   statistical abstract comprising the municipalities of Copenhagen and
   Frederiksberg and Copenhagen County. Of these, 501,158 live in the
   Municipality of Copenhagen, 91,855 in the Municipality of
   Frederiksberg, and 618,529 in the 18 municipalities of Copenhagen
   County.

   An even larger metropolitan region is known as the Copenhagen Region
   (Hovedstadsregionen), which consists of the municipalities of
   Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, and the counties of Copenhagen,
   Frederiksborg and Roskilde. The population of Hovedstadsregionen is
   1,831,751 (2006). Land area: 2760 km² (1,065.6 sq mi). Water area: 105
   km² (40.5 sq mi). Thus, the Copenhagen Region comprises 6,5% of the
   land area of Denmark, but has 34% of Denmark's population. This gives a
   total of 664 inhabitants per km² or 1,720 per square mile for the
   Region. This compares with a population density in the rest of the
   country of approximately 90 per km² or around 230 per square mile. The
   population density of the Region is around 300 inhabitants per km²
   (777/ sq mi) outside the metropolitan area of Copenhagen, and this is
   also the population density of Zealand as a whole.

Culture

General situation

   Danish newspapers rank Copenhagen as one of the world's best cities in
   which to live, despite the high cost of living.

   Strøget, a pedestrian shopping street in central Copenhagen was
   inaugurated in 1961. Copenhagen's extensive pedestrian network has been
   developed over the last 40 years through the work of architect and
   professor Jan Gehl.

   The Copenhagen Jazz Festival is a popular annual event that is the
   result of a significant jazz scene having existed for many years. It
   developed significantly when a number of American jazz musicians such
   as Ben Webster, Thad Jones, Richard Boone, Ernie Wilkins, Kenny Drew,
   Ed Thigpen, Bob Rockwell and others such as rock guitarist Link Wray
   came to Copenhagen beginning in the 1960s.

   Sexual equality is a high priority in Denmark. Women should encounter
   little or no discrimination in Copenhagen, and sexual harassment is
   rare compared to other Western capital cities, as well as crime in
   general.

   Copenhagen is a popular destination for homosexual travellers. It has
   an active gay community and a wide selection of nightlife options for
   those such as gay clubs for example the popular Pan Club Copenhagen.
   The more widely known gay pride festival is the annual Copenhagen Pride
   (formerly the Mermaid Pride Parade), a big Mardi Gras-like bash that
   occurs on a Saturday in early August, as well as Gay And Lesbian Film
   Festival Copenhagen held annually in late October. Danes are known to
   have a high degree of tolerance for "alternative" lifestyles of all
   sorts, and homosexuals receive equal rights to express themselves and
   are protected by anti-discrimination laws.

   Copenhagen is a 24-hour party city. For free entertainment simply
   stroll along Strøget, especially between Nytorv and Højbro Plads, which
   in the late afternoon and evening is a bit like an impromptu three-ring
   circus with musicians, magicians, jugglers and other street performers.

Sports

   Copenhagen has a wide variety of sport teams. Denmark's two leading
   football teams, Brøndby IF and FC København, are based in Copenhagen
   and its suburbs. FC København plays at Parken in Østerbro, Copenhagen.
   Brøndby IF plays at Brøndby Stadion outside of the municipality of
   Copenhagen.

   In recent years, Brøndby IF has become the second most successful team
   ever in Danish history, winning the Danish Championship 10 times and
   the Danish Cup 5 times since 1985. The most successful team in Danish
   history is KB — Kjøbenhavns Boldklub who has won the Danish
   championship 15 times. In 1992, KB merged with B1903 — winner of 6
   Danish Championships — forming FC København. FC København has won the
   Danish Championship 5 times and the Danish Cup 3 times over the last 14
   years (4 times Danish champions since 2001) — FC København was founded
   in 1992 and won their first Danish championship in their first season.
   FC København's home ground is the Danish national stadium, Parken.

   Notable Copenhagen teams playing at the second highest level in Danish
   football (the Danish 1st Division) include AB, HIK, Frem, Brønshøj,
   Fremad Amager and Skjold.

   Copenhagen also has three ice hockey teams: Rødovre Mighty Bulls,
   Herlev Hornets and Nordsjælland Cobras.

   There is both a men's and a women's handball team, and both teams play
   in the highest league. Both of the handballteams are owned by FC
   København and have the same name and logo. They were formerly known as
   FIF.

   Rugby is also played in the Danish capital with teams such as
   CSR-Nanok, Copenhagen Scrum, Exiles, Froggies and Rugbyklubben Speed.

   The Danish Australian Football League, based in Copenhagen is the
   largest Australian rules football competition outside of the English
   speaking world.

   Copenhagen is also home to a number of Denmark's 40-odd cricket clubs.
   Although Denmark has been an associate member of the International
   Cricket Council since 1966, the sport is not taught much in schools,
   and Danish cricket competes unfavourably with the much more widely
   followed sport of football for players, facilities, media attention and
   spectators.

   Copenhagen is also home to three prominent paintball teams, the
   Copenhagen Ducks, The Ugly Ducklings and the Copenhagen Berserks.
   Because of paintball's relative popularity in Scandinavia, these teams
   are well-known throughout the globe, despite Denmark's small size.

   The second World Outgames will take place in Copenhagen in 2009, after
   Berlin refused to stage them due to the continuing rivalry between the
   two gay sporting organisations.

Cuisine

   Copenhagen offers a great variety of fine restaurants and it is
   possible to find modest eateries with open sandwiches (called "
   smørrebrød"), which is the traditional and most known dish. Most
   restaurants, though, serve international dishes.

   Also, Copenhagen is known for the hotdog stands found throughout the
   city. The city is also home to many fine bakeries and pastry shops.

   The city boasts an impressive 10 Michelin star restaurants.

   Lately, immigration from the Middle East, Turkey and Arabian countries
   has made fast food dishes like kebab and falafel as popular as more
   traditional Danish fast food.

Transport

   Trains in Copenhagen outside the Carlsberg building

   The public transportation system of Copenhagen consists of commuter
   trains (called " S-Trains" (S-tog)), buses, and a metro. The S-trains
   form the basis of the transportation network, stretching to most areas
   of metropolitan Copenhagen, with their main hub at Copenhagen Central
   Station (København H). Some regional trains supplement the S-train
   services with lines extending further such as to the Copenhagen
   Airport, Elsinore, and Malmö.

   The entire system is operated by the Greater Copenhagen Authority
   (Hovedstadens Udviklingsråd), covering the three counties and two
   municipalities of Hovedstadsregionen (Copenhagen Region) – 50
   municipalities in total. Tickets are transferable from one means of
   transport to another (e.g. from bus to train) as long as the time limit
   is not exceeded. The region is divided into ninety-five zones, which
   determine the cost of a ticket. The more zones a ticket is valid for,
   the longer its time validity with a maximum of two hours. A trip of
   seven or more zones costs a base rate.

   Discount cards, known as punch cards, as well as period cards are
   available. Ticket prices are high and have increased substantially in
   recent years leading to a decrease in passenger numbers. In fact the
   percentage of trips made on public transportation in Copenhagen is
   quite low by northern European standards.

   An extensive road system is also in place, and the city's bicycle paths
   are extensive and well-used. The city provides public bicycles which
   can be found throughout the downtown area and used with a returnable
   deposit of 20 kroner. Bicycle paths are often separated from the main
   traffic lanes and sometimes have their own signal systems. Copenhagen
   is known as one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world , and
   is a centre of bicycle culture.
