   Bedbugs (or bed bugs) are small nocturnal insects of the family
   Cimicidae that live by hematophagy, feeding on the blood of humans and
   other warm-blooded hosts.

Biology

Genera and species

   The common bedbug ( Cimex lectularius) is the best adapted to human
   environments. It is found in temperate climates throughout the world
   and has been known since ancient times.

   Other species include Cimex hemipterus, found in tropical regions
   (including Florida), which also infests poultry and bats, and
   Leptocimex boueti, found in the tropics of West Africa and South
   America, which infests bats and humans. Cimex pilosellus and C.
   pipistrella primarily infest bats, while Haematosiphon inodora, a
   species of North America, primarily infests poultry.

   Oeciacus, while not strictly a bedbug, is a closely related genus
   primarily affecting birds.

Physical characteristics

   Adult bedbugs are reddish brown, flattened, oval, and wingless, with
   microscopic hairs that give them a banded appearance. A common
   misconception is that they are not visible to the naked eye, but adults
   grow to 4 to 5 mm (one-eighth to three-sixteenths of an inch) in length
   and do not move quickly enough to escape the notice of an attentive
   observer. Newly hatched nymphs are translucent and lighter in colour
   and continue to become browner and molt as they reach maturity. When it
   comes to size, they are often compared to lentils or appleseeds.

   A recent paper by Professor Brian J. Ford and Dr Debbie Stokes gives
   views of a bed bug under various microscopes.

Feeding habits

   Bedbugs are generally active only at night, with a peak attack period
   about an hour before dawn, though given the opportunity, they may
   attempt to feed at other times of day. Attracted by warmth and the
   presence of carbon dioxide, the bug pierces the skin of its host with
   two hollow tubes. With one tube it injects its saliva, which contains
   anticoagulants and anesthetics, while with the other it withdraws the
   blood of its host. After feeding for about five minutes, the bug
   returns to its hiding place. The bites cannot usually be felt until
   some minutes or hours later, as a dermatological reaction to the
   injected agents. Although bedbugs can live for up to 18 months without
   feeding, they typically seek blood every five to ten days.

   Bedbugs are often erroneously associated with filth. They are attracted
   by exhaled carbon dioxide, not by dirt, and they feed on blood, not
   waste. In short, the cleanliness of their environments has no effect on
   bedbugs. Their numbers may be reduced temporarily by vacuuming, but
   will recover and require vacuuming again.

Health effects on humans

   While bedbugs have been known to harbour pathogens in their bodies,
   including plague and hepatitis B, they have not been linked to the
   transmission of any disease and are not regarded as a medical threat.
   Some individuals, however, can get skin infections and scars from
   scratching bites. While bedbugs are not regarded as a vector of
   transmissible diseases, they may be a significant source of stress,
   alarm and/or distress. With some individuals, it may precipitate mild
   to moderate cases of delusional parasitosis.

Reproductive habits

   Female bedbugs can lay up to five eggs in a day and 500 during a
   lifetime. The eggs are visible to the naked eye measuring 1 mm in
   length (approx. 2 grains of salt) and are a milky-white tone in colour.
   The eggs hatch in one to two weeks. The hatchlings begin feeding
   immediately. They pass through five molting stages before they reach
   maturity. They must feed once during each of these stages. At room
   temperature, it takes about 5 weeks for a bed bug to pass from
   hatching, through the stages, to maturity. They become reproductively
   active only at maturity.

   All bedbugs mate via a process termed " traumatic insemination".
   Instead of inserting their genitalia into the female's reproductive
   tract as is typical in copulation, males instead pierce females with
   hypodermic genitalia and ejaculate into the body cavity. This form of
   mating is thought to have evolved as a way for males to overcome female
   mating resistance. Traumatic insemination imposes a cost on females in
   terms of physical damage and increased risk of infection. To reduce
   these costs females have evolved internal and external "paragenital"
   structures collectively known as the “spermalege”. Within the True Bugs
   (Heteroptera) traumatic insemination occurs in the Prostemmatinae
   (Nabidae) and the Cimicoidea (Anthocoridae, Plokiophilidae,
   Lyctocoridae, Polyctenidae and Cimicidae), and has recently been
   discovered in the plant bug genus Coridromius (Miridae).

   Remarkably, in the genus Afrocimex both males and females possess
   functional external paragenitalia, and males have been found with
   copulatory scars and the ejaculate of other males in their haemolymph.
   There is a widespread misbelief that males inseminated by other males
   will in turn pass the sperm of both themselves and their assailants
   onto females with whom they mate. While it is true that males are known
   to mate with and inject sperm into other males, there is however no
   evidence to suggest that this sperm ever fertilizes females inseminated
   by the victims of such acts.

Infestations

Method of initial infestation

   There are several means by which dwellings can become infested with
   bedbugs. People can often acquire bedbugs at hotels, motels, and
   bed-and-breakfasts, thanks to increased domestic and international
   tourism, and bring them back to their homes in their luggage. They also
   can pick them up by inadvertently bringing infested furniture or used
   clothing to their household. If someone is in a place that is severely
   infested, bedbugs may actually crawl onto and be carried by people's
   clothing, although this is atypical behaviour — except in the case of
   severe infestations, bedbugs are not usually carried from place to
   place by people on clothing they are currently wearing. Finally,
   bedbugs may travel between units in multi-unit dwellings (such as
   condominiums and apartment buildings), after being originally brought
   into the building by one of the above routes. This spread between units
   is dependent in part on the degree of infestation, on the material used
   to partition units (concrete is a more effective barrier to the spread
   of the infestation), and whether or not infested items are dragged
   through common areas while being disposed of, resulting in the shedding
   of bedbugs and bedbug eggs while being dragged.

Common location of infestations

   Bedbugs are very flat, allowing them to hide in tiny crevices. A crack
   wide enough to fit the edge of a credit card can harbour bedbugs [even
   in the ceiling]. In the daytime, they tend to stay out of the light,
   hidden in such places as mattress seams, mattress interiors, bed
   frames, nearby furniture, carpeting, baseboards, or bedroom clutter.
   Bedbugs can settle in the open weave of linen; this will often appear
   as a gray spindle a centimeter long and a thread wide, with a dark
   speck in the middle. Bedbugs can be found on their own, but more often
   congregate in groups. They are not social insects, however, and do not
   build or stay in nests. These groups of bedbugs are very often found in
   beds, usually either in the seams of a mattress (usually the seams
   closest to the sleeper), in the boxspring, or within the structure of
   the bed itself. They can also be found in a wide variety of locations
   in a home, such as behind baseboards, behind a picture frame, within
   books (near the bed), in telephones, or radios near the bed, and within
   the folds of curtains. When not feeding, bedbugs are likely to be found
   hiding in shaded areas such as the seam along which the floor and wall
   meet, or under the edge of the carpet. Bedbugs are capable of
   travelling as far as 100 feet to feed, but usually remain close to the
   host in bedrooms or on sofas where people may sleep. They feed every
   five to 10 days. The manner in which infestations spread throughout a
   home or within an apartment building is not entirely understood and
   differs from case to case.

   It is important to inspect all adjacent rooms for infestation, as
   bedbugs travel easily and quickly along pipes and boards. In treatment,
   it is important to consider the insides of walls as potential places
   for bedbug infestation.

Size of infestations

   The numerical size of a bedbug infestation is to some degree variable,
   as it is a function of the elapsed time from the initial infestation.
   With regards to the elapsed time from the initial infestation, even a
   single female bedbug brought into a home has a potential for
   reproduction, with its resulting offspring then breeding, resulting in
   a geometric progression of population expansion if control is not
   undertaken. Sometimes people are not aware of the insects, but do
   notice the bites. The visible bedbug infestation does not represent the
   infestation as a whole, as there may be infestations elsewhere in a
   home, however, the insects do have a tendency to stay close to their
   hosts (hence the name "bed" bugs).

Detection of infestations

   Many misconceptions exist about bedbugs.

   It is a common misconception that bedbug infestations can be detected
   by smell, or by the presence of small red blood stains. The most
   reliable way of detecting bedbug infestations is through the presence
   of bedbug feces, which can stain bedding.

   Though bedbug bites can occur singly, they often follow a distinctive
   pattern of a linear group of three bites, sometimes macabrely referred
   to as "breakfast, lunch and dinner". These patterns of bites are caused
   when a bedbug is disturbed in feeding by a person moving, and then the
   bedbug resumes feeding. Bedbug bites also often occur in lines marking
   the paths of blood vessels running close to the surface of the skin.
   The effect of these bites on humans varies from person to person, but
   often cause welts and swelling that are more itchy and longer-lasting
   than mosquito bites. Some people, however, have little or no reaction
   to bedbug bites. Those whose bodies do not initially react may
   subsequently develop symptoms, however, due to an allergic reaction
   caused by the development of antigen. Bedbugs never crawl under one's
   skin and markings implying this may be signs of other skin infections
   or a severe allergic reaction to bedbug bites.

   A technique for "catching" (detecting) bedbugs is to have a light
   source accessible from bed and to turn it on at about an hour before
   dawn, which is usually the time when bedbugs are most active. A
   flashlight is recommended instead of room lights, as the act of getting
   out of bed will cause any bedbugs present to scatter. Bedbugs can also
   sometimes be viewed during the day.

   Some individuals have used glue traps placed in strategic areas around
   their home (sometimes used in conjunction with heating pads, or
   balloons filled with exhaled breath, thus offering the carbon dioxide
   that bedbugs look for) in order to attract and thus detect bedbug
   infestations. There are also commercial traps like "flea" traps whose
   effectiveness is really questionable except perhaps as a means of
   detection, but traps will certainly not work to control an infestation.

   Perhaps the easiest method for detection is to place double sided
   carpet tape in long strips near or around the bed and check the strips
   after a day or more. This is also useful in detecting insect presence
   in general.

   Veterinarians may mistake bedbugs' leavings on a pet's fur as " flea
   dirt".

   The above having been said, bedbugs are known for being elusive,
   transient and nocturnal. For many, the only way to detect and identify
   with certainty an infestation is to contact a pest control
   professional.

Incidence of infestations

   With the widespread use of DDT in the 1940s and '50s, bedbugs all but
   disappeared from North America in the mid-twentieth century.
   Infestations remained common in many other parts of the world, however,
   and in recent years have begun to rebound in North America.
   Reappearance of bedbugs in the developed world has presented new
   challenges for pest control, and, without DDT and similarly banned
   agents, no fully effective treatment is now in use. The industry is
   only beginning to develop procedures and techniques.

   Another reason for their increase is that pest control services more
   often nowadays use low toxicity gel-based pesticides for control of
   cockroaches, the most common pest in structures, instead of residual
   sprays. When residual sprays meant to kill other insects were commonly
   being used, they resulted in a collateral insecticidal effect on
   potential bedbug infestations; the gel-based insecticides primarily
   used nowadays do not have any effect on bedbugs, as they are incapable
   of feeding on these baits.

   The Professional Pest Management Association, a US advocacy group for
   pest control operators (PCOs) conducted a "proactive bed bug public
   relations campaign" in 2005 and 2006, resulting in increased media
   coverage of bedbug stories and an increase in business for PCOs,
   possibly distorting the scale of the increase in bedbug infestations. .

Living with infestation

   If it is necessary to live with bedbugs in the short term, it is
   possible to create makeshift temporary barriers around a bed. Because
   bedbugs cannot fly or jump, an elevated bed can be protected by
   applying double-sided sticky tape (carpet tape) around each leg, or by
   keeping each leg on a plastic furniture block in a tray of water. Bed
   frame can be effectively ridded of adult bedbugs and eggs by use of
   steam. Small steam cleaners are available and are very effective for
   this local treatment. A suspect mattress can be protected by wrapping
   it in a painter's disposable plastic dropcloth, neatly sealing shut all
   the seams with packing tape, and putting it on a protected bed after a
   final visual inspection. Bedding can be sanitized by a 120 °F (49 °C)
   laundry dryer. Once sanitized, bedding should not be allowed to drape
   to the floor. An effective way to quarantine a protected bed is to
   store sanitized sleeping clothes in the bed during the day, and bathing
   before entering the bed.

   Vermin and pets may complicate a barrier strategy. Bedbugs prefer human
   hosts, but will resort to other warm-blooded hosts if humans are not
   available, and some species can live up to eighteen months without
   feeding at all. A co-infestation of mice can provide an auxiliary food
   source to keep bedbugs established for longer. Likewise, a house cat or
   human guest might easily defeat a barrier by sitting on a protected
   bed. Such considerations should be part of any barrier strategy.

Predators near bed bug infestations

   Some bed bug predators may also be found near bed bug infestations. The
   most common bed bug predator are masked hunters.

   Jeffrey Hahn writes:

          Adult masked hunters are dark brown to black and are elongate
          oval in shape. When full grown, they're about 3/4 inch long.
          They have a short, stout, 3-segmented beak. Immature masked
          hunters are similar but smaller and lack developed wings. They
          are often covered with dust, lint and other debris, giving them
          a grayish or whitish appearance. Underneath, however, they are
          dark-colored like adults. Masked hunters do not feed on human
          blood. However, they are capable of inflicting painful bites as
          a defensive reaction if they are disturbed or carelessly
          handled. The bite feels like a bee sting followed by numbness
          and swelling. Rarely does a masked hunter bite require medical
          attention. Masked hunters do not transmit any disease.

   It is not wise to introduce masked hunters to bed bug infestations in
   hopes of exterminating the bed bugs.

Treatment

Self-treatment

   Some individuals have had success conducting their own exterminations
   by preparing an insecticide mixture of pyrethrins and fresh-water
   diatomaceous earth. At least one manufacturer produces a household
   insecticide D-20 with only .2% naturally derived pyrethrins and 1.0%
   Piperonyl Butoxide, which magnifies the pyrethrin's effectivenes by 10
   times. Natural pyrethrins are more expensive than many alternatives.
   The function of the pyrethrins is to stimulate the nervous system of
   the bugs so that the spasms will allow the diatomaceous earth to
   desiccate, puncture, and kill the bugs through mechanical action. Great
   care should be taken not to use products with salt-water diatomaceous
   earth or heat-treated diatomaceous earth (the common industrial forms),
   which can damage the lungs of any mammal (dogs, cats, or humans) which
   inhale it (due to its extreme sharp crystalline edges), and has also
   been known to cause cancer. Fresh-water diatomaceous earth, however, is
   commonly used to deworm cats, dogs, and humans, and is considered as
   safe as table salt. What is sold as food-grade diatomite generally
   contains very low percentages of crystalline silica.

   Others have used fruit and vegetable insecticides, comprised of a
   mixture of pyrethins and canola oil, which are usually safe for humans
   and most pets (aside from fish).

   One person writes: Contrary to popularly disseminated information,
   extreme heat or extreme cold is usually not effective in eliminating
   bedbugs. Pest control professionals receive reports of infestations
   even in the dead of winter, and manufactured environments of extreme
   heat or cold (such as encasing a mattress in a bag and placing it in
   direct sunlight, or placing a suspect piece of bedding or clothing in a
   freezer) usually cannot stay consistently hot or cold enough to
   sufficiently kill bedbugs, which are not particularly sensitive to
   temperature extremes.

   From a San Francisco tenant advocate: As someone who has suffered from
   bedbugs myself, and counsels and follows-through on approximately 35
   bedbug cases a month, proper exposure to extreme heat and cold is the
   most effective means of healthfully treating bedbug infestations. While
   mattresses generally need replacement because of their nearly
   unpenitrable thickness; sealing belongings in black plastic bags and
   leaving them in the boiler room or on a hot rooftop for several days is
   very successful in killing bedbugs and their eggs. Bedbugs, in fact,
   are very sensitive to extreme temperatures if left 2-3 days. Adding dry
   ice to bagged goods suffocates living bedbugs, but does not harm eggs.

   In addition, since bedbugs normally disperse, treatment of a bed or
   mattress is insufficient to eradicate an infestation.

Professional treatment

Selection of professionals

   Not all exterminators in North America are familiar with extermination
   techniques for bedbugs. In the past, fumigation with Cyanogas was used
   for bedbug control. This was very effective, but also very dangerous.
   This method is no longer used. Fumigation—that is the use of poison
   gases—is costly, and though this has been tried as a method of control
   in isolated cases, it is transient. New infestation can be imported
   shortly after a fumigation has taken place. Fumigation does work, but
   it may not be practical, and may not be permitted in most
   jurisidictions. Care must thus be taken when selecting an exterminator,
   in order to select a professional who knows how to conduct proper
   bedbug removal. The National Pest Management Association can assist in
   the location of pest control professionals.

Necessary number of professional treatments

   A survey of pest control professionals conducted by a pest control
   professor at the University of Massachusetts stated that 68% of all
   bedbug infestations require three or more treatments, 26% require two
   treatments, and 6% require just one. However, this survey does not seem
   to have taken into account the size of the infestation, the size of the
   venue being treated, the extensiveness of that venue's preparation for
   the treatment (thus enabling or inhibiting coverage of the poisons),
   the skill of the exterminator, whether popular nesting places have been
   disposed of, and the cause behind the original infestation. Treatment
   Exterminators will often apply a "contact kill" spray directly on
   bedbugs found in the apartment (such as a mixture of cyfluthrin,
   pyrethrins, and piperonyl butoxide), and then spray lambda-cyhalothrin
   on baseboards and other favorite hiding places. Lambda-cyhalothrin acts
   as a "slow kill" barrier which kills bedbugs after they cross it, and
   is usually microencapsulated, making it safe to pets and humans after
   it dries. Often, deltamethrin is also injected into larger crevices.
   The lambda-cyhalothrin and the deltamethrin are at their strongest for
   the first two weeks following their application, but usually retain
   effectiveness for up to 60 days.

   Successful treatment of a bedbug infestation is often highly dependent
   on how thorough the pest control professional is. Although the
   assessment and judgment of the pest control professional should be
   respected, most treatments cover such areas within homes as closets,
   curtains, outside and inside furniture crevices (dresser and desk
   drawers, night tables, etc.), as well as the interior of electrical
   outlets and behind pictures hangings on walls. If the choice was made
   to retain bedding, professionals will often either treat or steam-clean
   bedframes and the undersurface of solid beds. Some higher-end pest
   control firms also offer to perform the aforementioned vacuuming

Pre-treatment preparation

   Proper preparation is a mandatory requirement for control to be
   effective. Pest control firms should outline this in detail and provide
   detailed instructions on what to do. This is generally done by the
   resident; although some firms may offer preparation for an additional
   charge, this is uncommon. Preparation involves providing access for
   pest control treatment as well as taking measures to ensure that
   bedbugs are destroyed or contained. If a home is not properly prepared,
   successful elimination is practically impossible. Although preparation
   may be difficult for some people (for example, seniors or handicapped
   individuals), it is essential for effective treatment, and thus in such
   cases family members, friends or social or charitable agencies may need
   to provide assistance.

Packing

   All furniture and appliances in the dwelling usually need to be pulled
   away from the baseboards, and it is commonly asked that all furniture
   containing potential hiding crevices, such as bookshelves and desks, be
   emptied and left open for the exterminator to spray. Items in tightly
   sealed containers are usually safe from bedbug infestation and need not
   be emptied. Pest Control Operators may declare an item untreatable upon
   inspection--especially items of wood or paper.

Laundry

   Everything that can be laundered should be laundered, and laundered in
   advance of the treatment, then placed in plastic bags. This would
   include stuffed animals, drapes and so on.

   The items should be securely tied into plastic bags, and emptied
   directly from the bags into the machines. (The bags should then be
   immediately disposed of.) It is heat, not water, that kills any bedbugs
   residing within the laundered items; so the items should be washed in
   hot water, regardless of normal washing directions, and should be dried
   with medium heat (preferably high heat) for 20 minutes or more. (For
   those who have the ability to measure the temperature of the water in
   their washing machine, or of the hot air in their dryer, the target
   heat range is 120°F (49°C).)

   (If a marathon laundering session such as described is financially
   prohibitive, it has been posited by some that the items need only be
   run through the dryer, not the washing machine. However, the extensive
   water and spinning action associated with washing machines may assist
   in dislodging bedbugs from where they are residing within clothes and
   laundered.) However, this is optional as the heat of the cycle of
   drying will effectively kill all stages—eggs, immature stage (nymphs)
   and adults.

   For items that require dry cleaning, the dry cleaners should be
   informed that the items in question are potentially infested, and the
   items should be bagged. (However, many dry cleaners then may refuse to
   accept the items.)

   Steam cleaning of carpets can be helpful; although bedbugs will not be
   in the middle of the floor, they may be under the carpets at the edges
   of rooms. Vacuuming is especially important, however. Pesticide is
   applied at perimeters and is effective, but the more steps are taken to
   assist removal, the more thorough the elimination will be.

Vacuuming

   The mechanical removal of bedbugs by vacuuming is a most important part
   of preparing for control. Vacuuming alone will not solve the problem,
   but it will substantially reduce bedbug numbers and thus help reduce
   the population as part of preparing for treatment. A crevice attachment
   should be used on the seams of mattresses, on box springs, on bed legs,
   within furniture interiors, behind pictures, on curtains, and anywhere
   there is a possibility of the insects hiding (e.g. inside dresser
   drawers, dresser cases, under chairs, etc.). Carpets should also be
   vacuumed throughout the home, preferably with a power-head. Baseboards
   should also be vacuumed using the crevice tool—not swept—prior to the
   exterminator's arrival. Vacuum bags should then immediately be removed
   and placed in doubled plastic bags and placed into strong plastic bag
   for disposal. Spraying inside the vacuum cleaner bag with an aerosol
   insecticide or 50/50 alcohol/water mix is a good idea. The bags should
   be stored outside of home before collection. Incineration is not
   practical in the vast majority of urban centres and may be illegal.

Steam treatment

   Some pest control firms do offer steam treatment for items like
   mattresses or upholstered furniture especially when individuals are
   concerned about pesticides on bedding. This has only a very limited
   effectiveness, however, it is quite effective in this range of less
   than 1/2 inch of penetration. This also depends on the time that the
   steam is applied to the surface of the item. Small steam cleaners for
   domestic use can be useful for mattresses and the surfaces of
   upholstered furniture. This is a worthwhile option if there are issues
   of allergy, and the homeowner takes the time to treat carefully in this
   limited context.

Managing bedding

   There are differing opinions as to whether it is necessary to dispose
   of mattress, boxsprings, futons, pillows, and other bedding. There is
   of course often a heavy cost involved in the complete replacement of
   such bedding. It is clear, also, that getting rid of infested bedding
   alone does not solve the problem. The decision to replace bedding or
   not depends on the condition of and often related level of infestation
   within the items, the comfort level of the owner, whether the owner can
   afford replacement, and aesthetics. A reasonable rule of thumb is that
   new bedding does not need to be replaced but if bedding is older and
   replacement may have been done soon in any case, then of course,
   replacing it AFTER control is a welcome clean start. Treatment of
   bedding items must be done with care and according to the label on the
   insecticide used. Mattresses typically need local treatment with
   non-residual insecticides at seams and borders. Boxsprings are more
   difficult to treat as there are more places for the insects to hide.
   The notion that getting rid of bedding helps solve the problem is
   misguided. Infestation must be handled first and then if new bedding is
   desired, the old bedding can be disposed of. Spread of infestation in
   apartment buildings is increased by tenants deciding to throw away old
   bedding. An infested mattress or box spring dragged in a hallway to an
   elevator will cause bedbugs to fall off or even run off the item, and
   these may then find their way into other units. As noted here, the use
   of plastic bags to protect bedding after treatment or to enclose
   bedbugs when the items are being thrown away are invaluable in
   preventing spread of infestation. It is also suggested to slash or mark
   up infested items so that others do not take them back into the
   building.

   After the mattress and/or box spring or futon has been treated, placing
   these inside a cotton, polyvinyl or polyethylene bag is a good idea as
   a secondary means of defense. Bedbugs like to hide near the victim and
   are commonly found on seams of mattresses, or within the structure of
   box springs. The mattress bag serves to reduce this likelihood and in
   the case of box springs, it seals any remaining insects inside the bag.
   The mattress bag also protects the mattress from the mess of staining
   caused when bedbugs aggregate on seams. The bag is a good idea either
   until the infestation has been totally eliminated or in the case of
   good quality cotton bags, useful as a permanent protection for the
   mattress—and also to enable easier control if infestation recurs.

   Those who end up disposing of suspect items should enclose them in
   plastic mattress bags, or large garbage bags, to prevent shedding bugs
   and eggs on their way to the disposal site. Care should also be taken
   to label throwaway items with a warning about the suspected bedbug
   infestation, as furniture is often reclaimed by dumpster divers.

   New items should not be purchased until after the infestation has been
   thoroughly eliminated. Also, many retailers offer disposal of old
   mattresses. This can pose obvious problems if new and old mattresses
   are carried together on the same truck without the proper precautions
   taken.

Treatment

   Exterminators will often apply a "contact kill" spray directly on
   bedbugs found in the apartment (such as a mixture of cyfluthrin,
   pyrethrins, and piperonyl butoxide), and then spray lambda-cyhalothrin
   on baseboards and other favorite hiding places. Lambda-cyhalothrin acts
   as a "slow kill" barrier which kills bedbugs after they cross it, and
   is usually microencapsulated, making it safe to pets and humans after
   it dries. Often, deltamethrin is also injected into larger crevices.
   The lambda-cyhalothrin and the deltamethrin are at their strongest for
   the first two weeks following their application, but usually retain
   effectiveness for up to 60 days.

   Gentrol and Phantom can also be used for bed bug control. Gentrol
   contains the active ingredient (S)-Hydroprene, an insect growth
   regulator (IGR) that disrupts the normal growth development of
   cockroaches and stored product pests, drain flies and fruit flies, as
   well as bed bugs. Phantom® uses an active ingredient known as
   chlorfenapyr. It is non-repellent and relatively long-lasting.

   Successful treatment of a bedbug infestation is often highly dependent
   on how thorough the pest control professional is. Although the
   assessment and judgment of the pest control professional should be
   respected, most treatments cover such areas within homes as closets,
   curtains, outside and inside furniture crevices (dresser and desk
   drawers, night tables, etc.), as well as the interior of electrical
   outlets and behind pictures hangings on walls. If the choice was made
   to retain bedding, professionals will often either treat or steam-clean
   bedframes and the undersurface of solid beds. Some higher-end pest
   control firms also offer to perform the aforementioned vacuuming.

   Most infestations are not successfully handled by one treatment alone.
   Most require exterminators to visit multiple times. In multi-unit
   dwellings, such as apartment buildings, the whole building should be
   treated, in order to avoid a situation where bed bugs travel out of the
   treated unit, only to infest other apartments and/or repeatedly
   reinfest the original unit.

Post-treatment

   Bedbugs can often be seen alive for up to two weeks following treatment
   of a dwelling, although they should not be seen in great number (e.g.,
   only one or two). It is important to continue to monitor for bedbugs
   after the initial treatment.

   Vacuuming should not be performed for a period of time following
   treatment, as some pesticides dry as a fine film, and can be
   prematurely removed from the environment if vacuumed, allowing
   infestations to survive the treatment.

   Anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that many, and perhaps most, people
   who successfully deal with bedbug infestations find themselves overly
   paranoid about the possibility of reinfestation for varying lengths of
   time. These feelings of anxiety may have some relation to delusional
   parasitosis: "Sometimes an initial and real insect infestation precedes
   and triggers the delusion [...] Out of desperation the victims may move
   out of their home, only to report later that the ‘bugs’ have followed
   them there too." (The Physician’s Guide to Arthropods of Medical
   Importance, J.A. Goddard, CRC Press, 1993.)

   On the other hand, evidence likewise suggests that reinfestations do
   occur often, especially under certain circumstances. In multi-unit
   buildings, landlords often choose to save money by exterminating only
   those apartments where complaints of bed bugs have been received. Bed
   bugs easily travel from one apartment to the next along pipes and
   through holes or cracks in the wall, floor, or ceiling. So a thorough
   and repeated extermination of one apartment may clear the infestation
   for a time in that unit. Eventually, bed bugs may migrate back to their
   original home. Since immature bed bugs are as small as the period in a
   newspaper sentence, is also possible that items stored in sealed
   containers during the treatment period may contain bed bugs, nymphs, or
   eggs that were inadvertently stored. If even one bed bug survives the
   treatment(s), a reinfestation can occur. Likewise, an individual may
   have inadvertently carried a bed bug or nymph outside the home (in
   clothing, laptop case, purse), and these may cause infestations at
   work, in a car, and so on. This can lead to a recurrence at home.
