   Patrick Hart "Pat" Cash (born May 27, 1965, in Melbourne, Victoria) is
   a former professional tennis player from Australia. He is best
   remembered for winning the men's singles title at Wimbledon in 1987.

Early career

   Cash first came to the tennis world's attention as a brilliant junior
   player in the early 1980s. He was ranked the top junior player in the
   world in 1981, and in 1982 he won the junior titles at both Wimbledon
   and the US Open.

   Cash turned professional in 1982 and won his first top-level singles
   title that year in Melbourne.

   Cash established a reputation on the tour as a hard-fighting serve and
   volleyer, and for wearing his trademark black-and-white checked
   headband.

   In 1983, Cash was chosen to play for the Australian Davis Cup Team and
   became the youngest player to play in a Davis Cup final. He won the
   decisive singles rubber against Joakim Nystr√∂m as Australia defeated
   Sweden 3-2 to claim the cup.

   In 1984, Cash reached the men's singles semi-finals at both Wimbledon
   and the US Open. He lost in three sets in the Wimbledon semi-finals to
   John McEnroe, and was defeated in a thrilling five-set semi-final at
   the US Open by Ivan Lendl who claimed the fifth set in a tie-breaker.

   Cash finished runner-up in the men's doubles competition at Wimbledon
   in both 1984 and 1985.

   In 1986, Cash helped Australia win the Davis Cup again. Yet again they
   beat Sweden 3-2 in the final. And Cash again won the decisive singles
   rubber, coming back from two sets down against Mikael Pernfors to win
   in five sets.

   In 1987, Cash reached his first Grand Slam singles final at the
   Australian Open, where he lost a tight five-setter to Stefan Edberg in
   the last Australian Open final to be played on grass courts at Kooyong.

Wimbledon victory

   The crowning moment of Cash's career came at Wimbledon in 1987. Having
   beaten Mats Wilander in the quarter-finals and Jimmy Connors in the
   semi-finals, Cash moved through to the final where he faced the World
   No. 1 Ivan Lendl.

   Cash seized his moment and beat Lendl in straight-sets 7-6, 6-2, 7-5.

   Cash famously sealed a memorable victory by climbing into the stands
   and up to the player's box at Centre Court, where he celebrated with
   his family, girlfriend and coach. In doing so, he started a Wimbledon
   tradition which has been copied by many other champions in the years
   that followed.

Later career and retirement

   In 1988, Cash reached the Australian Open final for the second
   consecutive year and faced another Swede in the form of Mats Wilander.
   It was the first men's singles final to be played at the new Flinders
   Park venue, and Wilander won in an epic five-set, four-and-a-half-hour
   encounter, taking the fifth set 8-6.

   Cash played in his third Davis Cup final in 1990. This time Australia
   lost 3-2 in the final to the United States.

   Cash continued to play on the circuit on-and-off through to the mid-
   1990s. But a series of injuries to his Achilles' tendon, knees and back
   meant that he was never really able to recapture his best form after
   his triumphant Wimbledon-winning year in 1987. He won his last
   top-level singles title in 1990 in Hong Kong. His last doubles title
   came in 1996 at Pinehurst.

   Since his retirement from the tour, Cash has resided mainly in London.
   He has coached top players including Greg Rusedski and Mark
   Philippoussis. He has also worked as a TV commentator. A father of
   four, Cash's main passion away from tennis and his family is playing
   the guitar. He donned the stage with INXS at the 2003 Australian Open,
   and has played with his own band at various events and festivals.

   At an early age, Cash had two children out-of-wedlock with his
   girlfriend, the Norwegian model Anne-Britt Kristiansen. In 1990 Cash
   married Emily, the Neo-Geo Baseball champion, and they appeared
   together on the first series of the Gamesmaster television programme.
   They had two sons, twins Shannon and Jett, before divorcing.

   In 1999 Cash checked into a rehabilitation clinic for treatment for his
   drug and alcohol addictions. He publicly stated he was depressed and
   considering suicide.
