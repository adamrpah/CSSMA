   Part of the
   2003 Pacific hurricane season

   Hurricane Marty was the deadliest tropical cyclone of the 2003 Pacific
   hurricane season. Forming on September 18, it became the 13th tropical
   storm and fourth hurricane of the year. The storm moved generally
   northwestward and steadily intensified despite only a marginally
   favorable environment for development, and became a Category 2
   hurricane before making two landfalls on the Baja California peninsula
   and mainland Mexico.

   The hurricane was responsible for significant flooding and storm surges
   that caused $50.5 million (2003 USD) in damage, mostly on the peninsula
   of Baja California, and resulted in the deaths of 12 people. Marty
   affected many of the same areas that had been affected by Hurricane
   Ignacio a month earlier.

Storm history

   Storm path

   A tropical wave moved into the Pacific Ocean from Central America on
   September 10. Convection along the wave became better organized as it
   moved westward, and a tropical depression developed on September 18.
   The depression moved generally west-northwestward before strengthening
   into Tropical Storm Marty on September 19. The storm entrained dry air
   into its circulation as it curved toward the northwest, disrupting the
   storm's convective structure and inhibiting further intensification for
   the next two days. Eventually, Marty fought off the dry air and
   intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September 21.

   Marty began moving north-northwestward in response to a high pressure
   ridge to the west, and continued to strengthen, reaching a peak
   intensity of 100 mph (175 km/h) early on September 22. Marty then moved
   northward at an increased speed before making landfall 10 mi (15 km)
   northeast of Cabo San Lucas in Baja California Sur later that day.
   After making landfall, Marty turned back to the north-northwest, moving
   parallel to the eastern coast of the peninsula, and weakening to a
   tropical storm on the 23rd. Marty then stalled over the Gulf of
   California after encountering a high pressure system over the U.S.
   state of Nevada, and further weakened to a tropical depression before
   making a second landfall near Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, on the 24th.
   Marty became a remnant low pressure area on the 25th, and moved
   erratically over the northern Gulf of California for the next two days
   before drifting southwestward and dissipating over the northern Baja
   California Peninsula on the 26th.

Preparations

   Fearing a repeat of the damage left by Hurricane Ignacio a month
   earlier, many residents stocked up on supplies, secured their homes and
   evacuated to emergency shelters. The government of Mexico issued
   hurricane warnings for areas of the eastern coast of the Baja
   California Peninsula and the west coast of the mainland on September
   21. Tropical storm warnings were issued for the Mexican coastline to
   the Colorado River on the 23rd, but were discontinued later that day.
   Forecasters also predicted that the hurricane might cause 4 – 6 feet
   (122 – 182 cm) of storm surge, 8 inches (20.3 cm) of rain, serious
   flash flooding, and mudslides. Many schools and tourist destinations
   were used as emergency shelters and most seaports and airports were
   closed down. Across the Gulf of California, in the state of Sonora,
   authorities of the municipality of Empalme monitored the status of the
   Punta de Agua dam, located 30 km (20 mi) upstream of the municipal
   seat, which threatened to overtop and flood the city. As a result, 300
   residents were evacuated to shelters in higher ground.

Impact

Baja California Peninsula

   About 8 to 11 inches (20–28 cm) of rain fell in areas of the Baja
   California Peninsula, with the largest 24-hour rainfall total ocurring
   at Todos Santos, Baja California Sur, where 197.5 mm (7.77 in) of rain
   fell. Numerous ships offshore reported tropical storm and hurricane
   force winds, and an automated weather station in Cabo San Lucas, Baja
   California Sur, reported sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) with
   gusts to 115 mph (185 km/h). Santa Rosalía, Baja California Sur,
   reported 7.8 inches (19.8 cm) of rain..

   Five people drowned after their cars were swept away by floodwaters
   while trying to cross a flooded stream. The floods also damaged
   4,000-6,000 homes and buildings and significantly disrupted water and
   communications for an extended period of time. The hurricane's storm
   surge damaged many boats and yachts in ports along the peninsula's
   coast, most of them beyond repair. Minor beach erosion was reported at
   San Felipe, Baja California. As a result, the Baja California Sur
   municipalities of La Paz, Los Cabos, Loreto, Comondú and Mulegé were
   declared national disaster areas.

Mainland Mexico

   On the mainland, the largest daily rainfall total occurred on Sebampo,
   Sonora, which recorded 171.0 mm (6.73 in) of rain. Five fishermen
   drowned when their fishing boat sank in the Gulf of California, off the
   coast of Sonora. Also in that state, the University of Sonora suspended
   operations in its Navojoa campus. Two more people died when a tree fell
   on a car in Sinaloa. Heavy rainfall caused moderate to severe flash
   flooding in Sonora and Sinaloa, although damage was not as severe or as
   extensive as on the Baja California peninsula. Los Mochis, Sinaloa,
   reported sustained winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) on September 22.

   Rainfall totals from Marty

   The outer bands of Marty brought locally heavy rains to extreme
   southwestern Arizona, but there were no reports of flooding. The
   highest rain total was 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) at Organ Pipe Cactus
   National Monument in Arizona. Rainfall extended eastward into Texas,
   where a storm peak of 3.09 inches of rain occurred in Tankersly.

   Because the damage caused by Marty was not extreme, the name of the
   storm was not retired from the rotating Pacific hurricane name lists,
   and will reused in the 2009 season.
