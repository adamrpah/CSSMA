   In the Whyte notation, a 2-8-0 is a railroad steam locomotive that has
   a single-axle leading truck followed by four powered driving axles. In
   the US, this wheel arrangement is commonly called a Consolidation.

   The equivalent UIC classification is 1-D.

History

   Of all the locomotive types that were created and experimented with in
   the early part of the 19th century, the 2-8-0 was a relative latecomer.
   The 2-6-0, often considered the logical forerunner to the 2-8-0, was
   first created in the early 1860s.

   The first locomotive of this wheel arrangement was likely built by the
   Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), but like the first 2-6-0s, this first
   2-8-0 had a leading axle that was rigidly attached to the locomotive's
   frame. To create this 2-8-0, the PRR's master mechanic John P. Laird
   modified an existing 0-8-0, the Bedford between 1864 and 1865.

   The locomotive Consolidation, built in 1865 is widely considered the
   first true 2-8-0 built in the United States. It is this locomotive that
   is the origin of the class name.

   Only a few railroads purchased this locomotive type upon its
   introduction by Baldwin. Even the Baltimore & Ohio, which had nearly
   180 of this locomotive type in regular service by 1885, didn't purchase
   any of this type until 1873.

   The 2-8-0 design was given a major boost in 1875 when the PRR made it
   the railroad's standard freight locomotive. 1875 was also the year that
   the Erie Railroad began replacing its 4-4-0s in freight service with
   2-8-0s. The railroads found that the 2-8-0 could move trains twice as
   heavy for half the cost of their earlier brethren. From a financial
   standpoint, the choice of freight locomotives was clear.

European use

   The 2-8-0 was also a popular type in Europe, again largely as a freight
   hauler.

Germany

   The 2-8-0 enjoyed a brief period of popularity in Germany during the
   period of the State Railways (LÃ¤nderbahnen) prior to the establishment
   of the Deutsche Reichsbahn Gesellschaft (German National Railways) in
   1920. The DRG chose the 2-10-0 as the heavy freight locomotive type for
   the new, unified rail system. Under the DRG's classification system,
   all 2-8-0s were assigned to series (Baureihe) BR 56, with different
   types receiving sub-classifications. The earliest type was the Prussian
   G7^3 of 1893.

United Kingdom

   The 2-8-0 was the standard heavy freight steam locomotive type in the
   20th Century. The first 2-8-0 built in Britain was the Great Western
   Railway's 2800 Class from 1903. Other systems followed the GWR's lead;
   notable British 2-8-0s include the LMS Stanier Class 8F, the GCR Class
   8K, and the WD Austerity 2-8-0 of the World War II period.
