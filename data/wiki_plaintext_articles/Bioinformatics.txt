   Bioinformatics and computational biology involve the use of techniques
   including applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, computer
   science, artificial intelligence, chemistry and biochemistry to solve
   biological problems usually on the molecular level. Research in
   computational biology often overlaps with systems biology. Major
   research efforts in the field include sequence alignment, gene finding,
   genome assembly, protein structure alignment, protein structure
   prediction, prediction of gene expression and protein-protein
   interactions, and the modeling of evolution.

   The terms bioinformatics and computational biology are often used
   interchangeably. However bioinformatics more properly refers to the
   creation and advancement of algorithms, computational and statistical
   techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems posed by
   or inspired from the management and analysis of biological data.
   Computational biology, on the other hand, refers to hypothesis-driven
   investigation of a specific biological problem using computers, carried
   out with experimental and simulated data, with the primary goal of
   discovery and the advancement of biological knowledge. A similar
   distinction is made by National Institutes of Health in their working
   definitions of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, where it is
   further emphasized that there is a tight coupling of developments and
   knowledge between the more hypothesis-driven research in computational
   biology and technique-driven research in bioinformatics. Computational
   biology also includes lesser known but equally important subdisciplines
   such as computational biochemistry and computational biophysics.

   A common thread in projects in bioinformatics and computational biology
   is the use of mathematical tools to extract useful information from
   data produced by high-throughput biological techniques such as genome
   sequencing. A representative problem in bioinformatics is the assembly
   of high-quality genome sequences from fragmentary "shotgun" DNA
   sequencing. Other common problems include the study of gene regulation
   using data from microarrays or mass spectrometry.

Major Research Areas

Sequence analysis

   Since the Phage Î¦-X174 was sequenced in 1977, the DNA sequences of
   hundreds of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases. These
   data are analyzed to determine genes that code for proteins, as well as
   regulatory sequences. A comparison of genes within a species or between
   different species can show similarities between protein functions, or
   relations between species (the use of molecular systematics to
   construct phylogenetic trees). With the growing amount of data, it long
   ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually. Today,
   computer programs are used to search the genome of thousands of
   organisms, containing billions of nucleotides. These programs can
   compensate for mutations (exchanged, deleted or inserted bases) in the
   DNA sequence, in order to identify sequences that are related, but not
   identical. A variant of this sequence alignment is used in the
   sequencing process itself. The so-called shotgun sequencing technique
   (which was used, for example, by The Institute for Genomic Research to
   sequence the first bacterial genome, Haemophilus influenza) does not
   give a sequential list of nucleotides, but instead the sequences of
   thousands of small DNA fragments (each about 600-800 nucleotides long).
   The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned in the right way,
   make up the complete genome. Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data
   quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite
   complicated for larger genomes. In the case of the Human Genome
   Project, it took several months of CPU time (on a circa-2000 vintage
   DEC Alpha computer) to assemble the fragments. Shotgun sequencing is
   the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today, and
   genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics
   research.

   Another aspect of bioinformatics in sequence analysis is the automatic
   search for genes and regulatory sequences within a genome. Not all of
   the nucleotides within a genome are genes. Within the genome of higher
   organisms, large parts of the DNA do not serve any obvious purpose.
   This so-called junk DNA may, however, contain unrecognized functional
   elements. Bioinformatics helps to bridge the gap between genome and
   proteome projects--for example, in the use of DNA sequences for protein
   identification.

Genome annotation

   In the context of genomics, annotation is the process of marking the
   genes and other biological features in a DNA sequence. The first genome
   annotation software system was designed in 1995 by Owen White, who was
   part of the team that sequenced and analyzed the first genome of a
   free-living organism to be decoded, the bacterium Haemophilus
   influenzae. Dr. White built a software system to find the genes (places
   in the DNA sequence that encode a protein), the transfer RNA, and other
   features, and to make initial assignments of function to those genes.
   Most current genome annotation systems work similarly, but the programs
   available for analysis of genomic DNA are constantly changing and
   improving.

Computational evolutionary biology

   Evolutionary biology is the study of the origin and descent of species,
   as well as their change over time. Informatics has assisted
   evolutionary biologists in several key ways; it has enabled researchers
   to:
     * trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring
       changes in their DNA, rather than through physical taxonomy or
       physiological observations alone,
     * more recently, compare entire genomes, which permits the study of
       more complex evolutionary events, such as gene duplication, lateral
       gene transfer, and the prediction of bacterial speciation factors,
     * build complex computational models of populations to predict the
       outcome of the system over time
     * track and share information on an increasingly large number of
       species and organisms

   Future work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex tree of
   life.

   The area of research within computer science that uses genetic
   algorithms is sometimes confused with computational evolutionary
   biology, but the two areas are unrelated.

Measuring biodiversity

   Biodiversity of an ecosystem might be defined as the total genomic
   complement of a particular environment, from all of the species
   present, whether it is a biofilm in an abandoned mine, a drop of sea
   water, a scoop of soil, or the entire biosphere of the planet Earth.
   Databases are used to collect the species names, descriptions,
   distributions, genetic information, status and size of populations,
   habitat needs, and how each organism interacts with other species.
   Specialized software programs are used to find, visualize, and analyze
   the information, and most importantly, communicate it to other people.
   Computer simulations model such things as population dynamics, or
   calculate the cumulative genetic health of a breeding pool (in
   agriculture) or endangered population (in conservation). One very
   exciting potential of this field is that entire DNA sequences, or
   genomes of endangered species can be preserved, allowing the results of
   Nature's genetic experiment to be remembered in silico, and possibly
   reused in the future, even if that species is eventually lost.

Analysis of gene expression

   The expression of many genes can be determined by measuring mRNA levels
   with multiple techniques including microarrays, expressed cDNA sequence
   tag (EST) sequencing, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) tag
   sequencing, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), or various
   applications of multiplexed in-situ hybridization. All of these
   techniques are extremely noise-prone and/or subject to bias in the
   biological measurement, and a major research area in computational
   biology involves developing statistical tools to separate signal from
   noise in high-throughput gene expression studies. Such studies are
   often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder: one might
   compare microarray data from cancerous epithelial cells to data from
   non-cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up-regulated
   and down-regulated in a particular population of cancer cells.

Analysis of regulation

   Regulation is the complex orchestration of events starting with an
   extra-cellular signal and ultimately leading to an increase or decrease
   in the activity of one or more protein molecules. Bioinformatics
   techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process.
   For example, promoter analysis involves the elucidation and study of
   sequence motifs in the genomic region surrounding the coding region of
   a gene. These motifs influence the extent to which that region is
   transcribed into mRNA. Expression data can be used to infer gene
   regulation: one might compare microarray data from a wide variety of
   states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in
   each state. In a single-cell organism, one might compare stages of the
   cell cycle, along with various stress conditions (heat shock,
   starvation, etc.). One can then apply clustering algorithms to that
   expression data to determine which genes are co-expressed. For example,
   the upstream regions (promoters) of co-expressed genes can be searched
   for over-represented regulatory elements.

Analysis of protein expression

   Protein microarrays and high throughput (HT) mass spectrometry (MS) can
   provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample.
   Bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein
   microarray and HT MS data; the former approach faces similar problems
   as with microarrays targeted at mRNA, the latter involves the problem
   of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from
   protein sequence databases, and the complicated statistical analysis of
   samples where multiple, but incomplete peptides from each protein are
   detected.

Analysis of mutations in cancer

   Massive sequencing efforts are currently underway to identify point
   mutations in a variety of genes in cancer. The sheer volume of data
   produced requires automated systems to read sequence data, and to
   compare the sequencing results to the known sequence of the human
   genome, including known germline polymorphisms.

   Oligonucleotide microarrays, including comparative genomic
   hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, able to probe
   simultaneously up to several hundred thousand sites throughout the
   genome are being used to identify chromosomal gains and losses in
   cancer. Hidden Markov model and change-point analysis methods are being
   developed to infer real copy number changes from often noisy data.
   Further informatics approaches are being developed to understand the
   implications of lesions found to be recurrent across many tumors.

   Some modern tools (e.g. Quantum 3.1 ) provide tool for changing the
   protein sequence at specific sites through alterations to its amino
   acids and predict changes in the bioactivity after mutations.

Prediction of protein structure

   Protein structure prediction is another important application of
   bioinformatics. The amino acid sequence of a protein, the so-called
   primary structure, can be easily determined from the sequence on the
   gene that codes for it. In the vast majority of cases, this primary
   structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment.
   (Of course, there are exceptions, such as the bovine spongiform
   encephalopathy - aka Mad Cow Disease - prion.) Knowledge of this
   structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein. For
   lack of better terms, structural information is usually classified as
   one of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. A viable general
   solution to such predictions remains an open problem. As of now, most
   efforts have been directed towards heuristics that work most of the
   time.

   One of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of homology. In
   the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the
   function of a gene: if the sequence of gene A, whose function is known,
   is homologous to the sequence of gene B, whose function is unknown, one
   could infer that B may share A's function. In the structural branch of
   bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein
   are important in structure formation and interaction with other
   proteins. In a technique called homology modelling, this information is
   used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a
   homologous protein is known. This currently remains the only way to
   predict protein structures reliably.

   One example of this is the similar protein homology between haemoglobin
   in humans and the haemoglobin in legumes ( leghemoglobin). Both serve
   the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism. Though both of
   these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their
   protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near
   identical purposes.

   Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein
   threading and de novo (from scratch) physics-based modeling.

   See also structural motif and structural domain.

Comparative genomics

   The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the
   correspondence between genes (orthology analysis) or other genomic
   features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that
   make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for
   the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events
   acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the
   lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a
   higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral
   transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ultimately,
   whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization,
   polyploidization and endosymbiosis, often leading to rapid speciation.
   The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to
   developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to
   a spectra of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques,
   ranging from exact, heuristics, fixed parameter and approximation
   algorithms for problems based on parsimony models to Markov Chain Monte
   Carlo algorithms for Bayesian analysis of problems based on
   probabilistic models.

   Many of these studies are based on the homology detection and protein
   families computation.

   See also comparative genomics, bayesian network and protein family.

Modeling biological systems

   Systems biology involves the use of computer simulations of cellular
   subsystems (such as the networks of metabolites and enzymes which
   comprise metabolism, signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory
   networks) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of
   these cellular processes. Artificial life or virtual evolution attempts
   to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of
   simple (artificial) life forms.

High-throughput image analysis

   Computational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the
   processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of
   high-information-content biomedical imagery. Modern image analysis
   systems augment an observer's ability to make measurements from a large
   or complex set of images, by improving accuracy, objectivity, or speed.
   A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer.
   Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery, biomedical
   imaging is becoming more important for both diagnostics and research.
   Some examples are:
     * high-throughput and high-fidelity quantification and sub-cellular
       localization ( high-content screening, cytohistopathology)
     * morphometrics
     * clinical image analysis and visualization
     * determining the real-time air-flow patterns in breathing lungs of
       living animals
     * quantifying occlusion size in real-time imagery from the
       development of and recovery during arterial injury
     * making behavioural observations from extended video recordings of
       laboratory animals
     * infrared measurements for metabolic activity determination

Software tools

   First generation bioinformatics tools consisted of applications,
   usually with a text-based interface, which performed a specific task
   well. The computational biology tool best-known among biologists is
   probably BLAST, an algorithm for searching large databases of protein
   or DNA sequences. The NCBI provides a popular web-based implementation
   that searches their massive sequence databases. Also fairly early on,
   due to the amassing of sequence and annotation data, keyword search
   engines which were able to resolve gene and protein synonyms were
   important. In these early days, computer scripting languages such as
   Perl and Python were often used to interface with biological databases
   and parse output from bioinformatics programs written in languages such
   as C or C++, and much legacy code is still in use today. Today, many
   other languages are used to author excellent software, and communities
   of bioinformatics programmers have set up free open source
   bioinformatics projects to develop and distribute the tools and modules
   they produce.

   As the data sources expanded and diversified, both in content and
   geography, bioinformatic meta search engines, such as Sequence
   profiling tools, emerged to help find relevant information from several
   databases. These meta search engines might index data from a local
   server or even from a panel of third party services.

   More recently, SOAP-based interfaces have been developed for a wide
   variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running
   on one computer in one part of the world to use algorithms, data and
   computing resources on servers in other parts of the world. A large
   availability of these SOAP-based bioinformatics web services, along
   with the open source bioinformatics collections, lead to the next
   generation of bioinformatics tools: the integrated bioinformatics
   platform. These tools range from a collection of standalone tools with
   a common data format under a single, slick standalone or web-based
   interface, to integrative and extensible bioinformatics workflow
   development environments.

   An interesting novel direction for bioinformatics applications is
   illustrated by Q-Pharm's Quantum 3.1, an example of the bioinformatics
   post- QSAR technology applying quantum and molecular physics instead of
   statistical methods.
