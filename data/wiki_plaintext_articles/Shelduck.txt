   The Shelducks, genus Tadorna, are a group of large birds in the
   Tadorninae subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that
   includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and
   swans.

   A shelduck is approximately 58.5 cm in length and has a white plumage
   with bold brown and black markings. It can be found from the British
   Isles across, Europe and Asia to Eastern China.

   The shelducks are a group of larger often semi-terrestrial waterfowl,
   which can be seen as intermediate between geese (Anserinae) and ducks.
   Their diet consists of small shore animals ( winkles, crabs etc) as
   well as grasses and other plants.
