   Raven is the common name given to several large black birds of the
   genus Corvus. Other birds in the same genus are the smaller crows,
   jackdaws, and rooks.

   In much of Europe and North America, raven is used as a synonym for the
   widespread Common Raven, and much of the literature and culture
