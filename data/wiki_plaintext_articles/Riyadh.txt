   Riyadh (Arabic: الرياض‎ ar-Riyāḍ) is the capital and largest city of
   the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, located in Ar Riyad Province in the Najd
   region. It is situated in the centre of the Arabian peninsula on a
   large plateau and is home to over 4,260,000 people (around 20% of the
   nation's population).

   The city lies in Saudi Arabia's 'central corridor' of development along
   with Buraydah and Al Kharj in the Ar Riyad administrative division. The
   other areas of concentrated population are two coastal areas - around
   Jiddah and Mecca on the Red Sea, and around Jubail and Dhahran on the
   Persian Gulf. Riyadh is located at 24°42'42" North, 46°43'27" East
   (24.711667, 46.724167).

   The city is divided into 17 branch municipalities under the control of
   the Riyadh Municipality and the Riyadh Development Authority, chaired
   by Riyadh Province Governor Prince Salman Bin Abdul Aziz.

   Although in a highly arid area the city does receive some rainfall.
   Five dams store the runoff. There are also 96 wells and 290 miles (467
   km) of pipe bringing huge volumes of water from desalination plants on
   the Persian Gulf.

Name

   The name Riyadh is derived from the Arabic word meaning a place of
   gardens and trees ("rawdah"). With many wadis (a former water course,
   now dry) in the vicinity, Riyadh has been since antiquity a fertile
   area set in the heartland of the Arabian peninsula.

History

   In pre-Islamic times, the settlement at the site was called Hajar. The
   site is at the confluence of several rivers (now wadis) and much
   underground water is accessible at the site. The settlement was
   historically famous for its dates and orchards. The modern name was
   first applied to only certain parts of the settlement where orchards
   predominated. Gradually the name was used for the entire settlement.

   By the end of the 18th century, Riyadh was part of the First Saudi
   State, with the capital at Diriyah. After the destruction of Diriyah in
   1818 by the Turks, the capital moved to Riyadh. Portions of Diriyah, a
   city made of mud bricks, still exist.

   The city was seized in 1902 by Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud. He
   went on to establish the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, with
   Riyadh the capital of the nation. The diplomatic capital remained at
   Jeddah until 1982. Recently the city has experienced very high rates of
   population growth, which is indicated by the poor quality of
   development since the 1970s. In the 1960s, its population was 50,000.
   According to most recent sources, today it is home for over 4.5 million
   inhabitants.

City districts

   Once a small walled city, Riyadh has developed into a dynamic
   metropolis over the years. The first major thrust came during the oil
   boom of the 1950s, when older structures were demolished to make way
   for commercial development. Today, it is one of the fastest growing and
   most prosperous cities in the world.

   The capital and largest city of the Kingdom, Riyadh is divided into 17
   municipalities. Each contributes in its own way to the vibrant
   character of the city, which boasts of a fairly unique history and
   colorful past. The city has grown both culturally and commercially over
   the years. Along with the urban areas of Dhahran, Dammam, and
   Al-Khobar, Riyadh has become a focal point for both travel and trade.
   On the outskirts of the city lies the ancient town of AI-Dih'yah.

   In addition to being the centre of power, the city is also a commercial
   hub. Numerous educational, financial, agricultural, cultural,
   technical, and social organizations have set up base here. The most
   striking aspect of Riyadh is its architecture, which is a vibrant
   juxtaposition of the old and the new - contemporary high-rises tower
   over buildings exuberating of old world charm.

   The bustling Olaya District is the heart and soul of this city. This
   commercial and residential district offers accommodation,
   entertainment, dining and shopping options. The Kingdom Centre, Al
   Faisalyah and Al-Tahlya street the areas' landmarks.

   The centre of the city, Al-Bathaa, is also its oldest part. At its
   heart lies the beautiful 19th-century Masmak Castle, which is one of
   the city's major attractions; and to the west lies the Riyadh Museum of
   History and Archeology.

   The Diplomatic Quarter or DQ as it is popularly known, is home to
   foreign embassies, international organizations as well as residential
   structures and malls. With lush gardens and numerous sports facilities,
   it is also one of the city's greenest areas. It is especially known for
   its fine architecture, and is considered a model for other Islamic
   cities around the world. Despite its name, the Diplomatic Quarter
   offers no special privileges. All Saudi laws must be obeyed and there
   are occasional patrols by the Mutaween, or Saudi religious police.

   The Qasr Al-Hukm or the Justice Palace is located in the district of
   the same name. It is here that the Governor meets citizens and listens
   to their grievances and problems and stays abreast to all aspects of
   the region's life. Its architecture, like other buildings in the area,
   is a fine mélange of traditional and contemporary styles.

   While the Al Khobar District is a preferred residential choice for
   expatriates, the Al-Dira area is rich with commercial markets and
   traditional buildings, which include the famous Royal Palace and
   Al-Mue'qila building.

   Numerous shops, lively markets, world-cuisine restaurants, and huge
   malls keep both Salahuddin District and King Fahad highway packed with
   tourists.
