   Earl of Shaftesbury is a title in the Peerage of England. It was
   created in 1672 for Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 2nd Baronet, a prominent
   politician in the Cabal then dominating the policies of King Charles
   II. He had already been created Baron Ashley, of Wimborne St Giles in
   the County of Dorset, in 1661, and was made Baron Cooper of Paulett, in
   the County of Somerset, at the same time he was given the earldom.
   These titles are also in the Peerage of England. Baron Ashley is used
   as a courtesy title by the Earl's eldest son and heir apparent. The
   Baronetcy, of of Rockbourne in the County of Southampton, was created
   in the Baronetage of England in 1622 for the Earl's father John Cooper.
   He sat as Member of Parliament for Poole.

   Shaftesbury was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented
   Melcombe Regis and Weymouth in the House of Commons. His son, the third
   Earl, also sat as a Member of Parliament but is chiefly remembered as a
   writer and philosopher. On his death the titles passed to his son, the
   fourth Earl. He notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Dorset. His
   younger son, the sixth Earl, represented Dorchester in Parliament. He
   was succeeded by his son, the seventh Earl. He was a prominent
   politician, social reformer and philanthropist.

   His eldest son, the eighth Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Hull
   and Cricklade. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Earl. He was Lord
   Mayor of Belfast, Lord Lieutenant of Belfast, County Antrim and Dorset
   and Lord Steward of the Household. On his death the titles passed to
   his grandson, the tenth Earl, the son of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Lord
   Ashley. He was murdered in 2004. As of 2007 the titles are held by his
   second and youngest son, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded his elder
   brother in 2005.

   Another member of the family was the Liberal politician Evelyn Ashley.
   He was the second son of the seventh Earl. His son was the Conservative
   politician Wilfrid Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple.

   The family seat is Ashley House, near Wimborne St Giles in Dorset. The
   family also own Lough Neagh, the largest lake in the British Isles.
