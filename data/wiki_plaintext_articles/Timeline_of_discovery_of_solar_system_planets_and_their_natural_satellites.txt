Timeline of discovery of solar system planets and their natural satellites

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Space (Astronomy); The
Planets

   This timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural
   satellites charts the progress of the discovery of new bodies over
   history.

   Historically the naming of natural satellites did not always match the
   times of their discovery.

   In the following tables, planetary satellites are indicated in bold
   type (e.g. Moon) while planets, major or minor, which directly circle
   the Sun are in italic type (e.g. Earth). The tables are sorted by
   publication/announcement date. Dates are annotated with the following
   symbols:
     * i: for date of first imaging (photography, etc.);
     * o: for date of first human visual observation, either through
       telescope or on photographic plate (the true "discovery" moment);
     * p: for date of announcement or publication.

   *Note: Marked moons had complicated discoveries. Several moons took
   several years to be confirmed, and in several cases were actually lost
   and rediscovered. Others were found in Voyager photographs years after
   they were taken.

Prehistory

   Unknown Sun
   Star In the Ptolemaic system, the Earth was believed to be at the
   centre of the cosmos. Seven planets were placed in orbit around it in
   an order of increasing distance from the Earth, first established by
   the Greek Stoics: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and
   Saturn. This list included two objects, the Sun and the Moon, which are
   no longer considered to be planets; it also excluded the Earth.
   Unknown Mercury
   1st Planet In Nicolaus Copernicus' heliocentric system ( De
   Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, 1543) the Earth came to be considered
   a planet revolving with the other planets around the Sun, in the
   following order of distance from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
   Jupiter, and Saturn. The Sun, now situated near the centre of
   revolution, was no longer considered a planet.

   Unknown Moon
   Earth I In the Copernican system, the Moon was considered to be no
   longer a planet but a natural satellite of the Earth, and was the only
   body in that system whose revolution was not centered on the Sun.

   discovered lately by Mr. Cassini at the Royal Observatory at Paris.,
   Philosophical Transactions 16 (1686-1692) pp. 79-85.
   Together with his previous two discoveries, Cassini named these
   satellites Sidera Lodoicea.

   In his work Kosmotheôros (published posthumously in 1698), Christiaan
   Huygens relates "Jupiter you see has his four, and Saturn his five
   Moons about him, all plac’d in their Orbits."
