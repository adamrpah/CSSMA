   Spiders are predatory invertebrate animals with two body segments,
   eight legs, no chewing mouth parts and no wings. They are classified in
   the order Araneae, one of several orders within the larger class of
   arachnids, a group which also contains scorpions, whip scorpions,
   mites, ticks, and opiliones (harvestmen). The study of spiders is known
   as arachnology.

   All spiders produce silk, a thin, strong protein strand extruded by the
   spider from spinnerets most commonly found on the end of the abdomen.
   Many species use it to trap insects in webs, although there are many
   species that hunt freely. Silk can be used to aid in climbing, form
   smooth walls for burrows, build egg sacs, wrap prey, and temporarily
   hold sperm, among other applications.

   All spiders except those in the families Uloboridae and Holarchaeidae,
   and in the suborder Mesothelae) (together about 350 species) can inject
   venom to protect themselves or to kill and liquefy prey. Only up to 200
   species, however, have bites that can pose health problems to humans.
   Many larger species' bites may be painful, but will not produce lasting
   health concerns.

   Spider anatomy:
   (1) four pairs of legs
   (2) cephalothorax
   (3) opisthosoma

   Spiders, unlike insects, have only two body segments (tagmata) instead
   of three: a fused head and thorax (called a cephalothorax or prosoma)
   and an abdomen (called the opisthosoma). The exception to this rule are
   the assassin spiders, whose cephalothorax seems to be almost divided
   into two independent units. Except for a few species of very primitive
   spiders (family Liphistiidae), the abdomen is not externally segmented.
   The abdomen and cephalothorax are connected with a thin waist called
   the pedicle or the pregenital somite, a trait that allows the spider to
   move the abdomen in all directions. This waist is actually the last
   segment (somite) of the cephalothorax and is lost in most other members
   of the Arachnida (in scorpions it is only detectable in the embryos).

Cephalothorax

   All spiders have eight legs, although a few ant-mimicking species use
   their front legs to imitate antennae, which spiders lack. Their eyes
   are single lenses rather than compound eyes, ranging from simple
   light/dark-receptors to eyes rivalling that of a pigeon (some jumping
   spiders).

   They have pedipalps (or just palps), at the base of which are coxae or
   maxillae next to their mouth that aid in ingesting food; the ends of
   the palp are modified in adult males into elaborate and often
   species-specific structures used for mating. Since they don't have any
   antennae, they are using specialised and sensitive hairs on their legs
   to pick up scent, sounds, vibrations and air currents.

   Because they can't chew their food, they have, like other arachnids, a
   tiny mouth they use as a short drinking straw to suck up the liquid
   parts of their prey. However, they are able to eat their own silk.

Sense organs

   Spiders usually have eight eyes in various arrangements, a fact which
   is used to aid in taxonomically classifying different species. Most
   species of the Haplogynae have six eyes, although some have eight (
   Plectreuridae), four (eg., Tetrablemma) or even two (most Caponiidae)
   eyes. Sometimes one pair of eyes is more well developed than the rest,
   or even, in some cave species, there are no eyes at all. Several
   families of hunting spiders, such as jumping spiders and wolf spiders,
   have fair to excellent vision. The main pair of eyes in jumping spiders
   even sees in colors.

   Net-casting spiders have enormous, compound lenses that give a wide
   field of view and gather available light very efficiently.

   However, most spiders that lurk on flowers, webs, and other fixed
   locations waiting for prey tend to have very poor eyesight; instead
   they possess an extreme sensitivity to vibrations, which aids in prey
   capture. Vibration sensitive spiders can sense vibrations from such
   various mediums as the water surface, the soil or their silk threads.
   Also changes in the air pressure can be detected in the search for
   prey.

Respiration and circulation

   Spiders have an open circulatory system; i.e., they do not have true
   blood, or veins to convey it. Rather, their bodies are filled with
   haemolymph, which is pumped through arteries by a heart into spaces
   called sinuses surrounding their internal organs.

   Spiders have developed several different respiratory anatomies, based
   either on book lungs, a tracheal system, or both. Mygalomorph and
   Mesothelae spiders have two pairs of book lungs filled with haemolymph,
   where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter
   and diffuse oxygen. This is also the case for some basal araneomorph
   spiders like the family Hypochilidae, but the remaining members of this
   group have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the
   posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into
   tracheae, through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or
   directly to the tissue and organs. This system has most likely evolved
   in small ancestors to help resist desiccation. The trachea were
   originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of spiracles,
   but in the majority of spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a
   single one in the middle, and migrated posterior close to the
   spinnerets.

   Among smaller araneomorph spiders we can find species who have evolved
   also the anterior pair of book lungs into trachea, or the remaining
   book lungs are simply reduced or missing, and in a very few the book
   lungs have developed deep channels, apparently signs of evolution into
   tracheae. Some very small spiders in moist and sheltered habitats have
   no breathing organs at all, and instead breathe directly through their
   body surface. In the tracheal system oxygen interchange is much more
   efficient, enabling cursorial hunting (hunting involving extended
   pursuit) and other advanced characteristics as having a smaller heart
   and the ability to live in drier habitats.

Digestion

   Digestion is carried out internally and externally. Spiders that do not
   have powerful chelicerae secrete digestive fluids into their prey from
   a series of ducts perforating their chelicerae. These digestive fluids
   dissolve the prey's internal tissues. Then the spider feeds by sucking
   the partially digested fluids out. Other spiders with more powerfully
   built chelicerae masticate the entire body of their prey and leave
   behind only a relatively small residue of indigestible materials.
   Spiders consume only liquid foods. Many spiders will store prey
   temporarily. Web weaving spiders that have made a shroud of silk to
   quiet their envenomed prey's death struggles will generally leave them
   in these shrouds and then consume them at their leisure.

Spinnerets

   The abdomen has no appendages except from one to four (usually three)
   modified pairs of movable telescoping organs called spinnerets, which
   produce silk. The suborder Mesothelae is unique in having only two
   types of silk glands - thought to be the ancestral condition. All other
   spiders have the spinnerets further towards the posterior end of the
   body where they form a small cluster, and the anterior central
   spinnerets on the tenth segment are lost or reduced (suborder
   Mygalomorphae), or modified into a specialised and flattened plate
   called the cribellum (parts of suborder Araneomorphae), which produces
   a thread made up of hundreds to thousands of very fine dry silk fibers
   resulting in a woolly structure that traps prey. The cribellate spiders
   were the first spiders to build specialised prey catching webs. Later
   some groups evolved (called ecribellate) that use silk threads dotted
   with sticky droplets to capture prey ranging from small arthropods to
   sometimes even small bats and birds.

   The spider life cycle progresses through three stages: the embryonic,
   the larval, and the nympho-imaginal.

   The time between when an egg is fertilized and when the spider begins
   to take the shape of an adult spider is referred to as the embryonic
   stage. As the spider enters the larval stage, it begins to look more
   and more like an full grown spider. It enters the larval stage as a
   prelarva and, through subsequent moults, reaches its larval form, a
   spider-shaped animal feeding off its yolk supply. After a few more
   moults (also called instars) body structures become differentiated.
   Soon, all organ systems are complete and the animal begins to hunt on
   its own; it has reached the nympho-imaginal stage.

   This stage is differentiated into two sub-stages: the nymph, or
   juvenile stage and the imago, or adult stage. A spider does not become
   sexually mature until it makes the transition from nymph to imago. Once
   a spider has reached the imago stage, it will remain there until its
   death. After sexual maturity is reached, the general rule is that they
   stop moulting, but the females of some non-araneomorph species will
   continue to moult the rest of their lives.

   Many spiders may only live for about a year, but a number will live two
   years or more, overwintering in sheltered areas. The annual influx of
   'outdoor' spiders into houses in the fall is due to this search for a
   warm place to spend the winter. It is common for tarantulas to live
   around twenty years.

Reproduction

   Spiders reproduce by means of eggs, which are packed into silk bundles
   called egg sacs. Spiders often use elaborate mating rituals (especially
   the visually advanced jumping spiders) to allow conspecifics to
   identify each other and to allow the male to approach and inseminate
   the female without triggering a predatory response. If the approach
   signals are exchanged correctly, the male spider must (in most cases)
   make a timely departure after mating to escape before the female's
   normal predatory instincts return.

   Sperm transmission from male to female occurs indirectly. When a male
   is ready to mate, he spins a web pad upon which he discharges his
   seminal fluid. He then dips his pedipalps (also known as palpi), the
   small, leg-like appendages on the front of his cephalothorax, into the
   seminal fluid, picking it up by capillary attraction. Mature male
   spiders have swollen bulbs on the end of their palps for this purpose,
   and this is a useful way to identify the sex of a spider in the field.
   With his palps thus charged he goes off in search of a female.
   Copulation occurs when the male inserts one or both palps into the
   female's genital opening, known as the epigyne. He transfers his
   seminal fluid into the female by expanding the sinuses in his palp.
   Once the sperm is inside her, she stores it in a chamber and only uses
   it during the egg-laying process, when the eggs comes into contact with
   the male sperm for the first time and are fertilized; this may be why
   the vivipary has never evolved in spiders.

   Very unusual behaviour is seen in spiders of the genus Tidarren: the
   male amputates one of his palps before maturation and enters his adult
   life with one palp only. The palpi constitute 20% of the body mass of
   males of this species, and since this weight greatly impedes its
   movement, by detaching one of the two he gains increased mobility. In
   the Yemeni species Tidarren argo, the remaining palp is then torn off
   by the female. The separated palp remains attached to the female's
   epigynum for about four hours and apparently continues to function
   independently. In the meantime the female feeds on the palpless male.

Sacrificial males

   It is a common belief that male spiders, which usually are
   significantly smaller than the females, are likely to be killed after
   or during mating, or sometimes even before mating can occur.

   Even in some species of black widow, which are named exactly for this
   belief, the male may live in the female's web for some time without
   being harmed. However, the male of the closely related Australian
   redback spider is killed ritually by the females after it inserts its
   second palpus in the female genital opening; in over 60% of cases the
   female then eats the male. Males that 'sacrifice' themselves gain the
   benefit of increasing their paternity relative to males who do not get
   cannibalized, by feeding the egg-laying female.

   In many other species, males are sometimes killed by females. In at
   least some of these cases it's likely that the males are simply
   mistaken as prey.

Ecology

   Spiders have a great range of variation and lifestyle, although all are
   predatory.

   While spiders are generalist predators, in actuality their different
   methods of prey capture often determine the type of prey taken. Thus
   web-building spiders rarely capture caterpillars, and crab spiders that
   ambush prey in flowers capture more bees, butterflies and some flies
   than other insects. Groups of families that tend to take certain types
   of prey because of their prey capture methods are often called guilds.
   A few spiders are more specialized in their prey capture. Dysdera
   captures and eats sowbugs, pillbugs and beetles, while pirate spiders
   eat only other spiders. Bolas spiders in the family Araneidae use sex
   pheromone analogs to capture only the males of certain moth species.
   Despite their generally broad prey ranges, spiders are one of the most
   important links in the regulation of the populations of insects. Every
   day on a meadow they devour over 10 g/m² of insects and other
   arthropods.

Behaviour

   Spiders show a wide range of behaviour, from the ballet-like mating
   dances of certain jumping spiders to the seeming athletics of bolas
   spiders snatching their prey. Most diversity comes with the mode of
   predation, for example whether the spider waits for it in its orb web,
   or hunts it down.

Predatory techniques

   There are many families of spiders, and the ways that they catch prey
   are diverse. But whether they catch insects, fish, small mammals, small
   birds, or some other small form of life, as soon as a spider makes
   contact with its prey it will generally attempt to bite it.

   Spiders bite their prey, and occasionally animals that cause them pain
   or threaten them, to do two things. First, they inflict mechanical
   damage, which, in the case of a spider that is as large as or larger
   than its prey, can be severe. Second, they can choose to inject venom
   through their hollow fangs. Many genera, such as the widow spiders,
   inject neurotoxins that can spread through the prey's entire body and
   interfere with vital body functions. Other genera inject venom that
   operates to produce tissue damage at the site of the bite. Genera such
   as that of the brown recluse spider produce a necrotoxin. The
   necrotoxin is injected into prey where it causes the degradation of
   cell membranes. In the larger victims that do not die from these
   attacks, painful lesions over a fairly wide area of the body can remain
   active for fairly long periods of time. The spitting spiders have
   modified their poison glands to produce a mixture of venom and sticky
   substance that works as glue and immobilises the prey.

   Although there are no vegetarian spiders, some species in the families
   Anyphaenidae, Corinnidae, Clubionidae, Thomisidae and Salticidae have
   been observed feeding on plant nectar. Several spider species are also
   known to feed on bananas, marmalade, milk, egg yolk and sausages in
   captivity.

   Some spiders spin funnel-shaped webs, others make sheet webs, spiders
   like the black widow make tangled, maze-like, webs, and still others
   make the spiral "orb" webs that are most commonly associated with
   spiders. These webs may be made with sticky capture silk, or with
   "fluffy" capture silk, depending on the type of spider. Webs may be in
   a vertical plane (most orb webs), a horizontal plane (sheet webs), or
   at any angle in between. Most commonly found in the sheet-web spider
   families, some webs will have loose, irregular tangles of silk above
   them. These tangled obstacle courses serve to disorient and knock down
   flying insects, making them more vulnerable to being trapped on the web
   below. They may also help to protect the spider from aerial predators
   such as birds and wasps.

   The spider, after spinning its web, will then wait on, or near, the web
   for a prey animal to become trapped. The spider can sense the impact
   and struggle of a prey animal by vibrations transmitted along the web
   lines.

   Other species of spiders do not use webs for capturing prey directly,
   instead pouncing from concealment (e.g. trapdoor spiders) or running
   them down in open chase (e.g. wolf spiders). The net-casting spider
   balances the two methods of running and web-spinning in its feeding
   habits. This spider weaves a small net which it attaches to its front
   legs. It then lurks in wait for potential prey and, when such prey
   arrives, lunges forward to wrap its victim in the net, bite and
   paralyze it. Hence, this spider expends less energy catching prey than
   a primitive hunter such as the Wolf spider. It also avoids the energy
   cost of weaving a large orb-web. The diving bell spider does not use
   its web directly in prey capture, but has modified it into an
   underwater diving bell. Even species whose ancestors were building
   spiral orb webs have given rise to spiders who no longer make webs, for
   instance some Hawaiian spiny-legged spiders (genus Tetragnatha, family
   Tetragnathidae) which have abandoned web construction entirely.

   Some spiders manage to use the 'signalling snare' technique of a web
   without spinning a web at all. Several types of water-dwelling spiders
   will rest their feet on the water's surface in much the same manner as
   an orb-web user. When an insect falls onto the water and is ensnared by
   surface tension, the spider can detect the vibrations and run out to
   capture the prey.

Hunting spiders

   Many spiders do not build webs for catching prey. Some examples
   include:
     * Brazilian wandering spider
     * Brown recluse spider
     * Huntsman spiders
     * Jumping spiders
     * Lynx spiders
     * Nursery web spiders
     * Spitting spiders
     * Tarantulas
     * Wolf spiders (Lycosidae)
     * Yellow sac spider
     * Assassin spider

Ambush predators

   Some actively lure prey (the Bolas spiders) and may capture them with a
   sticky ball of silk on a line; others (like the crab spiders, trapdoor
   spiders, or the six-eyed sand spider) wait in a high-traffic area and
   directly attack their prey from ambush.

Defense

   All spiders will attempt to protect themselves by biting, especially if
   they are unable to flee. Some tarantulas have a second kind of defense,
   a patch of urticating hairs, or urticating setae, on their abdomens,
   which is generally absent on modern spiders and Mesothelae. These
   ultra-fine hairs causes irritation and sometimes even allergic
   reactions in the attacker. Certain other species have specialized
   defense tactics. For example, the golden wheeling spider (Carparachne
   aureoflava) of the desert of Namibia escapes tarantula hawks (a species
   of wasp that lays its eggs in a paralyzed spider so the larvae have
   enough food when they hatch) by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling
   away.

Social spiders

   A few species of spiders that build webs live together in large
   colonies and show social behaviour, albeit not as well evolved as in
   social insects. The most social species is probably Anelosimus eximius,
   which can form colonies of up to fifty thousand individuals.

Web types

Tangleweb spiders

   Members of this group (family Theridiidae) are characterized by
   irregular, messy-looking, tangled, three-dimensional (non-sticky) webs,
   generally low and anchored to the ground or floor and wall. They are
   commonly found in or near buildings; some build webs in bushes. The
   spider generally hangs in the centre of its web, upside-down. Prey is
   generally ground-dwelling insects such as ants or crickets, in addition
   to small flying insects. These include the infamous black widows, the
   minute happyface spider, and thousands of other species.

Orb web spiders

   Enlarge

   Spiders in several families (eg., Araneidae, Tetragnathidae,
   Nephilidae) spin the familiar spiral snare that most people think of as
   the typical spider web. On average, an orb-weaving spider takes 30
   minutes to an hour to weave a web. They range in size from quite large
   (6+  cm) to very small (<1 cm), but all are quite harmless to humans,
   beyond the shock entailed from walking into a face-height web and
   having a large spider dangling from your nose. Many of the daytime
   hunters have a 'ferocious' appearance, with spines or large 'fangs',
   but they are almost invariably inoffensive, preferring to drop on a
   dragline to the ground when disturbed, rather than bite, which can
   nevertheless be quite painful.

Other forms of webs

   Many other groups spin webs in a variety of structural styles.

   Some (the Linyphiidae) make various forms of bowl- or dome-shaped webs
   with or without a flat sheet or a tangled web above or below. Some make
   a flat platform extending from a funnel-shaped retreat, with generally
   a tangle of silk above the web. The common northern hemisphere
   'funnel-web', 'house' or 'grass' spiders are only superficially similar
   to the notorious Sydney funnel-web spider, and are generally considered
   to be quite harmless. Some of the more primitive group Atypidae may
   make tubular webs up the base of trees, from inside which they bite
   insects that land on the webbing. These spiders look quite ferocious,
   but are not generally considered to be particularly dangerous to
   humans.

Evolution

   Trigonotarbids, spider-like arachnids, were among the oldest known land
   arthropods. Like spiders, they were terrestrial, respired through book
   lungs, and walked on eight legs with two additional legs adapted to use
   around their mouth. However, they were not true spiders, not even
   ancestral to them, but represented independent offshoots of the
   Arachnida.

   True spiders (thin-waisted arachnids) evolved about 400 million years
   ago, and were among the first species to live on land. They are
   distinguished by abdominal segmentation and silk producing spinnerets.
   The Pedipalpi (including whip scorpions) are believed to constitute the
   sister group to the Araneae.

   Most of the early segmented fossil spiders belonged to the Mesothelae,
   a group of primitive spiders with the spinnerets placed underneath the
   middle of the abdomen, rather than at the end as in modern spiders
   (Opisthothelae). They were probably ground dwelling predators of other
   primitive arthropods. Silk may have been used simply as a protective
   covering for the eggs, a lining for a retreat hole, and later perhaps
   for simple ground sheet web and trapdoor construction.

   As plant and insect life diversified so also did the spider's use of
   silk. Spiders with spinnerets at the end of the abdomen ( Mygalomorphae
   and Araneomorphae) appeared more than 250 million years ago, presumably
   promoting the development of more elaborate sheet and maze webs for
   prey capture both on ground and foliage, as well as the development of
   the safety dragline.

   By the Jurassic, the sophisticated aerial webs of the orb weaving
   spiders had already developed to take advantage of the rapidly
   diversifying groups of insects. A spider web preserved in amber,
   thought to be 110 million years old, shows evidence of a perfect orb
   web.

   The ability to weave orb webs is thought to have been "lost", and
   sometimes even re-evolved or evolved separately, in different breeds of
   spiders since its first appearance.

Taxonomy

   Almost 40,000 species of spiders (order Araneae) have been identified
   and are currently grouped into 111 families by arachnologists, but
   because of difficulties in collecting these often very minute and
   evasive animals, and because of many specimens stored in collections
   waiting to be described and classified, it is believed that up to
   200,000 species may exist.

   The order is composed of three suborders. In the non-venomous primitive
   Mesothelae, body segmentation is clearly visible, demonstrating the
   link of spiders with their segmented arthropod ancestors.

   The two other suborders, the Mygalomorphae (trapdoor spiders,
   funnel-web spiders, tarantulas) and the Araneomorphae ("modern"
   spiders), are sometimes grouped together as Opisthothelae. The latter
   account for about 94% of all spider species.

   The Mesothelae include the only recent family Liphistiidae. Two more
   families ( Arthrolycosidae and Arthromygalidae) are recognized from
   fossil evidence only.

   The Liphistiidae are burrowing spiders only found in Southeast Asia,
   China, and Japan with about 90 species in 5 genera. Spiders of this
   remnant suborder are very rare, and are among the most " primitive"
   types of spiders in existence.

   Recent Mesothelae are characterized by the narrow sternum on the
   ventral side of the prosoma. Several plesiomorphic characters may be
   useful in recognizing these spiders: there are tergite plates on the
   dorsal side and the almost- median position of the spinnerets on the
   ventral side of the opisthosoma.

Mygalomorphae

   The Mygalomorphae are also called the Orthognatha, referring to the
   orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross
   each other (cf Araneomorphae). This suborder includes the heavy bodied,
   stout legged spiders popularly known as tarantulas as well as the
   dangerous Australasian funnel-web spiders. They have ample poison
   glands that lie entirely within their chelicerae. Their chelicerae and
   fangs are large and powerful. Occasionally members of this suborder
   will even kill small fish, small mammals, etc. Most members of this
   suborder occur in the tropics and subtropics, but their range can
   extend farther toward the poles, e.g. into the southern and western
   regions of the United States and Canada, the northern parts of Europe
   and south into Argentina and Chile.

Araneomorphae

   Spinyback orbweaver
   Enlarge
   Spinyback orbweaver

   The Araneomorphae, (previously called the Labidognatha), are often
   known as the modern spiders. They are distinguished by having
   chelicerae that point diagonally forward and cross in a pinching
   action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close
   kin), where they point straight down. Most of the spiders that people
   encounter in daily life belong to this suborder, which makes up 94% of
   all spider species.

   There are approximately 95 families in this suborder, ranging from the
   minute Patu digua (0.37  mm) to the big and flashy Argiope, from the
   common orb-weaver spiders to the abstruse assassin spiders, from the
   reclusive tree trapdoor spiders to the inquisitive jumping spiders.

Creatures often mistaken for spiders

   In addition to the true spiders, there are several arachnids commonly
   mistaken for spiders, but which are not true spiders.
     * Camel spider, a species of solifugid (also commonly called
       sun-spiders or wind-scorpions), are the source of many urban
       legends. In spite of their bad reputation they are actually
       harmless to humans, and have no venom.
     * The daddy long-legs or harvestman is a member of the order
       Opiliones. These round-bodied arachnids have only two eyes and
       their heads are fused to their bodies. However, the name "daddy
       long-legs" is sometimes used to refer to cellar spiders, which have
       a similar leg shape; these are true spiders. Both are also often
       said to produce a deadly venom. While the harvestmen do not produce
       venom at all, the cellar spider's venom is completely harmless to
       humans.

Spiders and people

Spider bites

   Most spiders are unlikely to bite humans because they do not identify
   humans as prey. Spiders, even small ones, may however bite humans when
   pinched. For instance, a common jumping spider (Family: Salticidae),
   around ⅜ inch (1 cm) long, when pinched between the folds of a human's
   palm may inflict a bite that is about as painful as a bee sting.

   Spiders in the world which have been linked to fatalities in humans, or
   have been shown to have potentially fatal bites by toxicology studies
   of their venom, include:
     * The Brazilian wandering spider
     * The Australasian funnel-web spider
     * The six-eyed sand spider, and possibly other spiders of genus
       Sicarius
     * The widow spiders
     * The recluse spiders

   Spiders which likely are not deadly to humans, but which are
   nonetheless medically significant include:
     * The hobo spider (this is doubtful, however)
     * The yellow sac spider
     * Certain species of tarantulas
     * The false black widows

   Spiders which can inflict painful bites (often similar to a bee sting),
   but whose bites generally do not cause any systemic or long-lasting
   effects, include:
     * The huntsman spider
     * The redback jumping spider (not to be confused with the very
       dangerous redback spider, the latter being one of the widow
       spiders).

   None of these spiders will intentionally "come after you," but they
   should be removed from one's house to avoid accidental injury. Many
   authorities warn against spraying poisons indiscriminately to kill all
   spiders, because doing so may actually remove one of the biological
   controls against incursions of the more dangerous species by ridding
   them of their competition.

   If dangerous spiders are present in your area, be mindful when moving
   cardboard boxes and other such objects that may have become the shelter
   of a poisonous spider. There is no need to be fearful; just do not grab
   a spider.

Arachnophobia

   Arachnophobia is a specific phobia, an abnormal fear of spiders. It is
   among the most common of phobias. The reactions of arachnophobics often
   seem irrational to others (and sometimes to the sufferers themselves).
   People with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe
   could harbour spiders or that has visible signs of their presence, such
   as webs. If they see a spider they may not enter the general vicinity
   until they overcome the panic attack that is often associated with
   their phobia. They may feel humiliated if such episodes happen in the
   presence of peers or family members. The fear of spiders can be treated
   by any of general techniques suggested for specific phobias.

   Arachnophobia is also the title of a 1990 film, as well as a spin-off
   video game, in which (fictitious) deadly spiders overrun a small
   California town.

Spiders in symbolism and culture

   There are many references to the spider in popular culture, folklore
   and symbolism. The spider symbolizes patience for its hunting with web
   traps, and mischief and malice for its poison and the slow death this
   causes. It symbolises possessiveness for its spinning its prey into a
   ball and taking it to its burrow (for burrowing species).
