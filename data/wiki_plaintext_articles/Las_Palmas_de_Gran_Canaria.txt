   The city was founded in the 24th of June, 1478 by Juan Rejón and the
   Castillian troops, after fighting the local Guanches (aboriginal people
   of the Canary Islands). In 1492, Christopher Columbus stopped in the
   city prior to his first trip to the Americas. He also stopped on the
   way back to Spain. Today, a museum is named after him - Casa Colon in
   the Vegueta area of the city.

   Las Palmas is today a very cosmopolitan city. There are popular beaches
   nearby (Las Canteras and Las Alcaravaneras) and a busy harbor (Puerto
   de la Luz harbor) - one of the busiest ports in the world during the
   70s~early 90s. As a result, many people from all over the world live
   and work in Las Palmas. Merchants and traders from Africa, China,
   Russia and the Middle East mingle with each other in the streets of the
   harbour. The Korean and Indian communities are the largest foreign
   communities on the island, although the majority have been acquiring
   Spanish citizenships over the years.
