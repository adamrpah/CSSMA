   Pigeons and doves are some 300 species of near passerine birds in the
   order Columbiformes. In general parlance the terms "dove" and "pigeon"
   are used somewhat interchangeably. In ornithological practice there is
   a tendency for "dove" to be used for smaller species and "pigeon" for
   larger ones, but this is in no way consistently applied, and
   historically the common names for these birds involve much variation
   between "dove" and "pigeon".

   The species commonly referred to just as the "pigeon" is the feral Rock
   Pigeon, common in many cities.

   Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short
   slender bills with a fleshy cere.

   The usually flimsy nests are made of sticks, and the two white eggs are
   incubated by both sexes. Doves feed on seeds, fruit and other soft
   plantstuff. Unlike most other birds (but see flamingo), the doves and
   pigeons produce " crop milk", which is secreted by a sloughing of
   fluid-filled cells from the lining of the crop. Both sexes produce this
   highly nutritious substance to feed to the young.

   This family occurs worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the
   Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones. It is related to the extinct dodo.
   The young doves and pigeons are called "squabs".

Systematics and evolution

   The family is usually divided into five subfamilies, but this is
   probably inaccurate. For example, the American ground and quail doves
   which are usually placed in the Columbinae seem to be two distinct
   subfamilies. The order presented here follows Baptista et al. (1997)
   with some updates (Johnson & Clayton, 2000; Johnson et al., 2001;
   Shapiro et al., 2002).

   Note that the arrangement of genera and naming of subfamilies is in
   some cases provisional because analyses of different DNA sequences
   yield results that differ, often radically, in the placement of certain
   (mainly Indo-Australian) genera. This ambiguity, probably caused by
   Long branch attraction, on the other hand seems to confirm that the
   first pigeons evolved in the Australasian region, and that the
   "Treronidae" and allied forms (crowned and pheasant pigeons, for
   example) represent the earliest radiation of the group.

   Exacerbating these issues, columbids are not well represented in the
   fossil record. No really primitive forms have been found to date. The
   genus Gerandia which most likely belongs to the Columbinae has been
   described from Early Miocene deposits of France. Apart from that, all
   other fossils belong to extant genera. For these, and for the
   considerable number of more recently extinct prehistoric species, see
   the respective genus accounts.

Symbolism

     * White doves, usually meaning domesticated Rock Pigeons, are a
       traditional Christian and Jewish symbol of love and peace.
       According to the biblical story, a dove was released by Noah after
       the flood in order to find land; it came back carrying an olive
       branch, telling Noah that, somewhere, there was land. A dove with
       an olive branch has since then come to symbolize peace. In
       Christian iconography, a dove also symbolizes the Holy Spirit, in
       reference to Matthew 3:16 and Luke 3:22 where the Holy Spirit
       appeared as a dove at the Baptism of Jesus.
     * Doves or other birds are sometimes released at Christian weddings.
       It should be noted that these birds, unless they are trained homing
       pigeons, cannot survive in the wild and will either starve to death
       or be easy prey for predators.
     * Doves are often associated with the concept of peace and pacifism.
       They often appear in political cartoons, on banners and signs at
       events promoting peace (such as the Olympic games, at various
       anti-war/anti-violence protests, etc.), and in pacifist literature.
       A person who is a pacifist is sometimes referred to as a dove
       (similarly, in American politics, a person who advocates the use of
       military resources as opposed to diplomacy can be referred to as a
       hawk).
     * Ironically, although sometimes ungratefully considered "pests" in
       big cities, common pigeons or Rock Pigeons have served humans in
       times of war as war pigeons, and have even been awarded war medals
       to honour their services to humanity. These include the homing
       pigeon, Cher Ami, who received the French Croix de guerre for
       services during wartime, and who is now enshrined in the
       Smithsonian Institution, and G.I. Joe, who received the Dickin
       Medal for his role in preventing the bombing of an Italian village
       of over 1,000 people.

Doves as food

   Several species of pigeon or dove are used as food, and probably any
   could be; the powerful breast muscles characteristic of the family make
   excellent meat. In Europe the Wood Pigeon is commonly shot as a game
   bird, while Rock Pigeons were originally domesticated as a food
   species, and many breeds were developed for their meat-bearing
   qualities. The extinction of the Passenger Pigeon was at least partly
   due to shooting for use as food.

   Doves are Kosher, and they and Turtle Doves are the only birds that may
   be used for a Korban. Other Kosher birds may be eaten, but not brought
   as a Korban.

Spread of Disease

   Though feral pigeons are often associated with the threat of disease,
   this is actually a fairly recent idea. Brought about and popularized in
   part by pest control companies in the 1980s, the concept of dangerously
   communicable diseases spread by these city dwelling birds stands in
   stark contrast to reality. To quote Dr. Manuel Vargas of the New York
   City Department of Health: "[We have] no documented cases of
   communicable disease transmitted from pigeons to humans."

   In addition, pigeons do not spread West Nile Virus; though they can
   contract it, they do not appear to be able to transmit it. In fact,
   they are no longer monitored as an indication of the presence of the
   virus in the area (as crows still are.) Pigeons are also at extremely
   low risk for carrying or even contracting avian flu.

   Certainly pigeons, like any other wild animal, carry some risk of
   disease. They are known, in particular, to be susceptible to
   salmonellosis, tuberculosis, and ornithosis. (None of these have been
   proven to be transmitted from pigeons to humans, however.) It is wise,
   therefore, to use precautions when handling them.

Pigeon Lung

   Pigeon breeders sometimes suffer from an ailment known as Pigeon Lung.
   A form of Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Pigeon Lung is caused by the
   inhalation of the avian proteins found in feathers and dung. It can
   sometimes be combatted by wearing a filtered mask.

Overpopulation

   In the last few decades, people have begun to poison feral pigeons when
   their numbers become too large. This has proven to be fairly
   ineffective, however, as pigeons can breed very quickly (up to six
   times a year) and their numbers are determined by how much food is
   available; that is, they breed more often when more food is provided to
   them. When pigeons are poisoned, surviving birds do not leave the area.
   On the contrary, they are left with more food per bird than before.
   This attracts pigeons from outside areas as well as encouraging more
   breeding, and populations are reestablished quickly.

   A more effective tactic to reduce the number of feral pigeons is
   deprivation. , Cities around the world have discovered that not feeding
   their local birds results in a safe population decrease in only a few
   years.
