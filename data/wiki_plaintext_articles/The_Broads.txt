The Broads

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Geography of Great
Britain

   The Broads are a network of mostly navigable rivers and lakes (known
   locally as broads) in the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. The
   Broads and some surrounding land was constituted as a special area with
   a level of protection similar to a national park by The Norfolk and
   Suffolk Broads Act of 1988. The Broads Authority, a Special Statutory
   Authority responsible for managing the area, became operational in
   1989.

   The total area, the majority of which is in Norfolk, is 303 kmÂ², with
   over 200 km of navigable waterways. There are 7 rivers and about 50
   broads, mostly less than 12 feet deep. Out of 50 or so broads, only 13
   are generally open to navigation, with a further three having navigable
   channels. Some broads have navigation restrictions imposed on them in
   autumn and winter.

   The Broads give their name to the Broadland district council area

   Although the terms "Norfolk Broads" and "Suffolk Broads" are used to
   identify those areas within the two counties respectively, the whole
   area is sometimes referred to as the "Norfolk broads". The Broads
   Authority is promoting a Private Bill to be put before parliament in
   2006 to create the "Broads National Park". Since the "Standford
   principle" governing National parks puts a priority on conservation
   would be in conflict with the navigation aspects of the Broads, the
   Minister responsible has opposed the national park aspect and this is
   likely to be dropped.

Management

   The Broads are managed by the Broads Authority. Special legislation
   gives the navigation of the waterways equal status with the
   conservation and public enjoyment of the area.

   Specific parts of 'the Broads' have been awarded a variety of
   conservation designations, for instance:
     * Special Protection Area (SPA) status for an area named 'Broadland'
       composed of 28 SSSIs Site of Special Scientific Interest
     * Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) status for parts of the
       Halvergate Marshes
     * National Nature Reserve (NNR) status for:
          + Bure Marshes NNR
          + Benacre NNR
          + Ant Broads & Marshes NNR
          + Hickling Broad NNR
          + Ludham - Potter Heigham NNR
          + Redgrave and Lopham Fen NNR
          + Martham Broad NNR
          + Calthorpe Broad NNR
          + Mid-Yare NNR

   A specific project being considered under the UK Biodiversity Action
   Plan is re-introduction of the Large Copper butterfly, whose habitat
   has been reduced by reduction of fens.

   For many years the broads were regarded as natural features of the
   landscape. It was only in the 1960s that Dr Joyce Lambert proved that
   they were artificial features, the effect of flooding on early peat
   excavations. The Romans first exploited the rich peat beds of the area
   for fuel, and in the Middle Ages the local monasteries began to
   excavate the "turbaries" (peat diggings) as a business, selling fuel to
   Norwich and Great Yarmouth.The Cathedral took 320,000 tonnes of peat a
   year. Then the sea levels began to rise, and the pits began to flood.
   Despite the construction of windpumps and dykes, the flooding continued
   and resulted in the typical Broads landscape of today, with its reed
   beds, grazing marshes and wet woodland.

   The Broads have been a favourite boating holiday destination since the
   early 20th century. The waterways are lock-free, although there are
   three bridges under which only small cruisers can pass. The area
   attracts all kinds of visitors, including ramblers, artists, anglers,
   and bird-watchers as well as people "messing about in boats". The
   Norfolk wherry, the traditional cargo craft of the area, can still be
   seen on the Broads as some specimens have been preserved and restored.

   Ted Ellis, a local naturalist, referred to the Broads as "the breathing
   space for the cure of souls"

   A great variety of boats can be found on the Broads, from Edwardian
   trading wherries to state-of-the-art electric or solar-powered boats.

Geography

   The Broads largely follows the line of the rivers and natural
   navigations of the area. There are seven navigable rivers, the River
   Yare and its (direct and indirect) tributaries the Rivers Bure, Thurne,
   Ant, Waveney, Chet and Wensum. There are no locks on any of the rivers
   (except for Mutford lock in Oulton Broad that links to the saltwater
   Lake Lothing in Lowestoft), all the waterways are subject to tidal
   influence. The tidal range decreases with distance from the sea, with
   highly tidal areas such as Breydon Water contrasted with effectively
   non-tidal reaches such as the River Ant upstream of Barton Broad.

   The broads themselves range in size from small pools to the large
   expanses of Hickling Broad, Barton Broad and Breydon Water. The broads
   are unevenly distributed, with far more broads in the northern half of
   Broadland (the Rivers Bure, Thurne and Ant) than in the central and
   southern portions (the Rivers Yare, Waveney, Chet and Wensum).
   Individual broads may lie directly on the river, or are more often
   situated to one side and connected to the river by an artificial
   channel or dyke.

   Besides the natural watercourses of the rivers, and the ancient but
   artificial broads, there is one more recent navigation canal, the
   lock-less New Cut which connects the Rivers Yare and Waveney whilst
   permitting boats to by-pass Breydon Water.

   There is also a second navigable link to the sea, via the River Waveney
   and its link to Oulton Broad. Oulton Broad is part of the Broads tidal
   system, but is immediately adjacent to Lake Lothing which is itself
   directly connected to the sea via the harbour at Lowestoft. Oulton
   Broad and Lake Lothing are connected by Mutford Lock, the only lock on
   the broads and necessary because of the different tidal ranges and
   cycles in the two lakes.

   In the lists below, names of broads are emboldened to help distinguish
   them from towns and villages.

   from the centre of Norwich, past Norwich Cathedral to the confluence
   with the River Yare.

Trinity Broads

   The Trinity Broads are an exception to the general rule, in that whilst
   they are connected to each other they have no navigable connection to
   the rest of the broads. The broads are:
     * Rollesby Broad
     * Ormesby Broad
     * Filby Broad
     * Lily Broad
     * Ormesby Little Broad

Ecology

   The Broads are Britain's largest protected wetland and are home to a
   wealth of wildlife, especially birdlife. Amongst the waterfowl:
   Mallard, Coot, Moorhen, Great Crested Grebe, Greylag Goose, Canada
   Goose, Egyptian Goose. Larger birds include Grey Heron, Cormorant,
   Kestrel, Sparrowhawk and Bittern.

   The scarce Cetti's Warbler breeds in the Broads, and Britain's only
   breeding Common Cranes are found in the area. Among the rare insects is
   the Norfolk hawker, a dragonfly. Some of the broads are surrounded by
   fens, i.e. reed and sedge beds. Norfolk reed from the broads has been a
   traditional material for thatching houses.
