   Henri Matisse ( December 31, 1869 – November 3, 1954) was a French
   artist, noted for his use of colour and his fluid, brilliant and
   original draftsmanship. As a draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor, but
   principally as a painter, Matisse is one of the best-known artists of
   the twentieth century.

Biography

   Born Henri-Émile-Benoît Matisse in 1869 in Le Cateau-Cambrésis,
   Nord-Pas-de-Calais, France, he grew up in Bohain-en-Vermandois. In 1887
   he went to Paris to study law, working as a court administrator in Le
   Cateau-Cambrésis after gaining his qualification. He first started
   painting during a period of convalescence following an attack of
   appendicitis, and discovered "a kind of paradise" as he later described
   it. In 1891 he returned to Paris to study art at the Académie Julian
   and became a student of William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Gustave Moreau.
   Influenced by the works of the post-Impressionists Paul Cézanne,
   Gauguin, Van Gogh and Paul Signac, and also by Japanese art, he made
   colour a crucial element of his paintings from the first. Many of his
   paintings from 1899 to 1905 make use of a pointillist technique adopted
   from Signac.

   His first exhibition was in 1901 and his first solo exhibition in 1904.
   His fondness for bright and expressive colour became more pronounced
   after he moved southwards in 1905 to work with André Derain and spent
   time on the French Riviera. The paintings of this period are
   characterized by flat shapes and controlled lines, with expression
   dominant over detail. He became known as a leader of the Fauves (wild
   beasts), a group of artists which also included Derain, Georges Braque,
   Raoul Dufy and Maurice Vlaminck. The decline of the Fauvist movement
   after 1906 did nothing to affect the rise of Matisse; many of his
   finest works were created between 1906 and 1917 when he was an active
   part of the great gathering of artistic talent in Montparnasse.

   He was a friend as well as rival of his younger contemporary Picasso,
   to whom he is often compared. A key difference between them is that
   Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was much more
   inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently
   by both artists were women and still lifes, with Matisse more likely to
   place his figures in fully realized interiors.

   Matisse lived in Cimiez on the French Riviera, now a suburb of the city
   of Nice, from 1917 until his death in 1954. His work of the decade or
   so following this relocation shows a relaxation and a softening of his
   approach. This "return to order" is characteristic of much art of the
   post-World War I period, and can be compared with the neoclassicism of
   Picasso and Stravinsky, and the return to traditionalism of Derain.
   After 1930 a new rigor and bolder simplification appear. In 1941 he was
   diagnosed with cancer and, following surgery, he used a wheelchair.
   Matisse did not allow this setback to halt his work, and with the aid
   of assistants he started creating cut paper collages, often on a large
   scale, called gouaches découpés. His Blue Nudes series feature prime
   examples of this technique; these demonstrate the ability to bring his
   eye for colour and geometry to a new medium of utter simplicity, but
   with playful and delightful power.

   The first painting of Matisse acquired by a public collection was
   "Still Life with Geranium" in 1910, today exhibited in the Pinakothek
   der Moderne.

   Today, a Matisse painting can fetch as much as US $17 million. In 2002,
   a Matisse sculpture, "Reclining Nude I (Dawn)," sold for US $9.2
   million, a record for a sculpture by the artist.
