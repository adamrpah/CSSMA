   The GNU Project was announced in 1983 by Richard Stallman. It initiated
   the GNU operating system, software development for which began in
   January 1984.

   The founding goal of the project was, in the words of its initial
   announcement, to develop "a sufficient body of free software [...] to
   get along without any software that is not free." That goal was
   achieved in 1992 when the last gap in the GNU system, a kernel, was
   filled by a third-party Unix-style kernel called "Linux" being released
   as free software.

Philosophy

   Although its most visible output is technical, the GNU Project was
   launched as a social, ethical, and political initiative. As well as
   producing software and licenses, the GNU Project has published a large
   number of philosophical writings, the majority of which were penned by
   Stallman.

Website and publications

   The GNU project website is translated into many languages by
   volunteers. Most pages are available in 15 to 20 languages, while some
   are available in more than 30.
