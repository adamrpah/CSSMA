   J. S. Fry & Sons, Ltd. was a chocolate company owned by Joseph Storrs
   Fry and his family.

   This business moved through several names and hands before ending up as
   J. S. Fry & Sons.

   Timeline:
     * circa 1759 — Joseph Fry starts making chocolate
     * 1761 — Joseph Fry and John Vaughan purchase the chocolate business
       of Walter Churchman. Company named Fry, Vaughan & Co.
     * 1777 — Chocolate works move from Newgate Street to Union Street,
       Bristol
     * 1787 — Joseph Fry dies. Firm is renamed Anna Fry & Son
     * 1795 — Joseph Storrs Fry assumes control. He patents a method of
       grinding cocoa beans using a steam-powered engine. As a result
       factory techniques are introduced into the cocoa business.
     * 1803 — Anna Fry dies and Joseph Storrs Fry partners with a Dr.
       Hunt. The business is renamed Fry & Hunt
     * 1822 — Dr. Hunt retires and Joseph Storrs Fry takes his sons on as
       partners and the firm is renamed J. S. Fry & Sons. The company
       becomes the largest commercial producer of chocolate in Britain.
     * 1835 — Joseph Storrs Fry dies and the sons take full control.

   In 1847, the Fry's chocolate factory, located in Bristol, England,
   moulded the first ever chocolate bar suitable for widespread
   consumption. The firm began producing the Fry's Chocolate Cream bar in
   1866. Over 220 products were introduced in the following decades,
   including the Fry's Turkish Delight (or Fry's Turkish bar) in 1914. In
   1896 the firm became a registered private company. It was run by the
   Fry family, with Joseph Storrs Fry, grandson of the first Joseph Storrs
   Fry, as the chairman.

   Near the start of World War I the company was the largest employer in
   Bristol. Joseph Storrs Fry died in 1913. By 1919 the company merged
   with Cadbury's chocolate and the joint company named British Cocoa and
   Chocolate Company. The Fry's division was moved to Somerdale in 1923.
   After 1981 the name Fry's was no longer in use at Somerdale, but the
   factory is still a major producer of Cadbury's products.
