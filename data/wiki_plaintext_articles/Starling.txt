   Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family
   Sturnidae. Starlings occur naturally only in the Old World (Europe,
   Asia and Africa), some forms as far east as Australia, but several
   European and Asian species have been introduced to North America,
   Australia, and New Zealand.

   They are medium-sized passerines with strong feet. Their flight is
   strong and direct, and they are very gregarious. Their preferred
   habitat is fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. Several
   species live around habitation, and are effectively omnivores. Many
   species search for food by opening the bill after probing it into dense
   vegetation; this behaviour is called "open-bill probing" or is referred
   to by the German word "zirkeln."

   Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen. Most species nest in
   holes, laying blue or white eggs.

   Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and
   the members of the African genus Lamprotornis are known as glossy
   starlings because of their iridescent plumage. The two species of
   Buphagus are called oxpeckers.

   European Starlings introduced to North America have been a factor in
   reducing native cavity nesting bird populations (such as Bluebirds and
   Red-headed Woodpeckers) by competing aggressively for nesting cavities.

   Starlings were first brought to North America in the 1890s. Eugene
   Schieffelin decided that North America should contain all the birds
   mentioned in William Shakespeare's plays. As starlings receive a brief
   mention in Henry IV, Part 1, Schieffelin introduced 60 of the birds in
   Central Park, New York.

   Starlings have diverse and complex vocalizations, and have been known
   to imbed sounds from their surroundings into their own calls, including
   car alarms, and human speech patterns. The birds can recognize
   particular individuals by their calls, and are currently the subject of
   research into the evolution of human language .
