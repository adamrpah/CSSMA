   Tottenham Hotspur Football Club are an English football club, which
   play in the FA Premier League. The club is also known as Tottenham and
   Spurs, while their own fans also refer to them as the Lilywhites
   because of their traditional white shirts. Their home ground is White
   Hart Lane, Tottenham, London.

   Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League
   and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960-61 season. In
   1963, Spurs became the first English club to win a European trophy -
   the European Cup Winners' Cup.

   The club enjoys a long-standing rivalry with near neighbours Arsenal,
   and matches between the two are known as the North London derbies part
   of the many London Derbies that take place during the season.The club
   motto is Audere est Facere (lit: "To dare is to do") and their emblem
   is the cockerel and ball.

History

Formation to first league title

   In 1882 the Hotspur Football Club was formed by young men from a local
   grammar school and Hotspur cricket club. It is thought that the name
   Hotspur was associated with Sir Henry Percy (Sir Harry Hotspur) who
   lived locally in the 14th Century. The team later became Tottenham
   Hotspur to distinguish itself from another team called London Hotspur.

   At first Hotspur played in navy blue shirts. The club colours then
   varied from light blue and white halved jerseys, to red shirts and blue
   shorts, through chocolate brown and old gold and then finally, in the
   1899-1900 season, to white shirts and navy blue shorts as a tribute to
   Preston North End, the most successful team of the time.

   In 1888 Tottenham moved their home fixtures from the Lee River marshes
   to Northumberland Park where the club was able to charge for spectator
   admission. They turned professional just before Christmas 1895 and by
   1896 had been admitted to the Southern League and were attracting
   crowds sometimes nearing 15,000. Charles Roberts became Chairman from
   1898 to 1943.

   In 1899 Spurs made their final ground move to a former market garden in
   nearby High Road, Tottenham. In time the ground adopted the name of a
   local thoroughfare, White Hart Lane. The move proved successful as in
   1900, Tottenham won the Southern League title and crowned this
   achievement the next year by winning the FA Cup - becoming the only
   non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League.

   Tottenham achieved election to the Second Division of the Football
   League for the 1908-09 season, immediately winning promotion as
   runners-up to the First Division. Their record between 1910 and the
   Great War was poor and when football was suspended at the end of the
   1914-15 season, Tottenham were bottom of the league.

   There were shenanigans in 1919 when Arsenal - who had finished only
   fifth in Division 2 the previous season - were elected to the First
   Division in Spurs' place. Their relocation into Tottenham's hinterland
   and this duplicity triggered the derision Spurs fans feel for the
   Gunners. Tottenham were Division Two Champions in 1919-20 and in the
   following year, on April 23, 1921, Spurs went all the way to their
   second FA Cup Final victory beating Wolves 1-0 at Stamford Bridge.

   After finishing second to Liverpool in the league in 1922, Spurs
   experienced a steady decline, culminating in 1928's relegation. Spurs
   were unable to advance beyond the quarter finals of the FA Cup, getting
   that far three years running 1935- 1938. On September 3, 1939, as
   Neville Chamberlain declared war, Spurs were seventh in the Second
   Division. League Football was abandoned for the "duration".

   By 1949 Arthur Rowe was manager, and had devised and developed the “
   push and run” tactical style of play. This involved quickly laying the
   ball off to a teammate and running past the marking tackler to collect
   the return pass. It proved an effective way to move the ball at pace
   with players' positions and responsibility being totally fluid. Rising
   to the top of the Second Division, Tottenham ran away with their first
   ever league title. In 1951 they won the First Division Championship and
   became the first side to win Second and First Divisions in successive
   seasons. Playing heroes included Alf Ramsey, Ronnie Burgess, Ted
   Ditchburn, Len Duquemin, Sonny Walters and Bill Nicholson.

1960s to 1990s

   Bill Nicholson joined Tottenham Hotspur as an apprentice in 1936. The
   following 68 years saw him serve the club in every capacity from boot
   room to president. He guided Tottenham to major trophy success three
   seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the double in 1961, the FA Cup and
   European Cup Semi-final in 1962, and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1963. Key
   players included Danny Blanchflower, John White, Dave Mackay, Cliff
   Jones and Jimmy Greaves.

   After 1964, the Double side began to disintegrate due to age, injuries
   and transfers. Nicholson rebuilt a second successful team with imports
   like Alan Gilzean, Mike England, Alan Mullery, Terry Venables, Joe
   Kinnear and Cyril Knowles. They won the 1967 FA Cup and finished third
   in the league.

   Nicholson added the League Cup (1971 and 1973) and the UEFA Cup (1972)
   to Tottenham's illustrious history before he resigned at the start of
   the 1974-75 season due to both a poor start, and his disgust at seeing
   rioting fans in Rotterdam in a UEFA Cup final, which Spurs lost.

   Tottenham slipped out of the First Division at the end of the 1976-77
   season, and the club installed Keith Burkinshaw as manager in a bid to
   revitalise their fortunes. They won promotion to the top flight and
   lifted the FA Cup in 1981 beating Manchester City in a replay, with
   Ricardo Villa scoring a memorable solo goal. Spurs retained the trophy
   the following year, beating QPR. Key players in this successful
   Tottenham side included Steve Archibald, Garth Crooks, Glenn Hoddle,
   Osvaldo Ardiles, and Steve Perryman who, in seventeen seasons, played
   655 league games for Spurs. These players inspired Tottenham to UEFA
   Cup glory in 1984, but Burkinshaw walked out on the club within days to
   be succeeded by Peter Shreeves.

   In 1982 the club was bought by Monte Carlo-based property tycoon Irving
   Scholar. He arrived in a boardroom which had seen just one or two
   proficient directors since 1943. The challenge for Scholar was to
   reinstate financial stability after the construction of a new West
   Stand had almost bankrupted the club.

   Peter Shreeves was in charge for two seasons, achieving a third place
   finish in his first but losing his job after a slump in 1985-86. Luton
   Town manager David Pleat was appointed the new manager, and for much of
   1986-87 it looked as though it would be a very successful season.

   Playing with a five man midfield (Hoddle, Ardiles, Hodge, Paul Allen,
   Waddle) supplying the prolific Clive Allen, Tottenham mounted a serious
   challenge on all fronts. At one point in March, if they had won their
   remaining 13 matches, they would have won all domestic honours. As it
   was, they were defeated in the League Cup semi final by rivals Arsenal.
   After faltering at the final hurdle in the league, Spurs' hopes hinged
   on the FA Cup. Spurs had never before lost a domestic cup final while
   their opponents, Coventry, had never even reached a Cup Final before.
   Spurs were the favourites but suffered a 3-2 defeat at the hands of
   John Sillett's team. Pleat quit the following October following
   allegations over his private life.

   Spurs veteran Terry Venables was named Pleat's successor, and after two
   league seasons, guided the club to third place in 1989-90 and an FA Cup
   win in 1991. The new-look Tottenham team included two players who
   starred in England's run to the semi-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup
   – Paul Gascoigne and Gary Lineker.

   In 1990, a slump in the property market left chairman Irving Scholar on
   the verge of bankruptcy, leaving him with no option but to sell the
   club. Venables joined forces with businessman Alan Sugar to take over
   Tottenham Hotspur PLC and pay off its £20 million debts, part of which
   involved the sale of Gascoigne. Venables became chief executive, with
   Peter Shreeves again taking charge of first-team duties. His second
   spell as team manager lasted just one season, before he was dismissed
   in favour of joint coaches Ray Clemence and Doug Livermore. Tottenham's
   first Premier League season ended with a mid-table finish and Venables
   was removed from the club's board after a legal dispute with Sugar.
   Several years later the High Court ruled Venables to be unfit to be
   concerned in any way with the management of a company, in part due to
   his dealings at Tottenham.

Premier League era

   Having just won the Division Two playoffs as manager of WBA, former
   star Ossie Ardiles became the club's next manager in 1993. He was
   renowned for pronouncing Tottenham as Tottingham as well as helping
   them win two FA Cups and a UEFA Cup as a player.

   Ardiles captured three expensive players - German striker Jürgen
   Klinsmann and Romanian midfield duo Gheorghe Popescu and Ilie
   Dumitrescu. Tottenham employed the Famous Five: Teddy Sheringham and
   Klinsmann up front, Nick Barmby just behind, Darren Anderton on the
   right and Dumitrescu on the left. Klinsmann was a sensation, scoring
   freely and becoming a firm fan favourite. Ultimately these expensive
   signings made little difference to Tottenham's form and Ardiles was
   sacked in September 1994.

   During the 1994 close season, Tottenham was found guilty of making
   illegal payments to players and given one of the most severe
   punishments in English football history: 12 points deducted for the
   1994-95 season, a one year ban from the FA Cup, and a £600,000 fine.
   Alan Sugar protested against these penalties on the grounds that the
   people involved were no longer at the club, and the FA Cup ban and
   points deduction were both quashed.

   Ardiles was replaced by former QPR manager Gerry Francis, who turned
   around the club's fortunes dramatically. Tottenham climbed to seventh
   place in the league, and took advantage of their reinstatement to the
   FA Cup by reaching the semi-finals, a 4-1 defeat against eventual
   winners Everton preventing them from reaching the final.

   1996-97 saw Tottenham finish in 10th place. Striker Teddy Sheringham
   requested a move and was sold to Manchester United. In November 1997,
   with Spurs second from bottom and in danger of relegation, Francis was
   sacked. Christian Gross, coach of Swiss champions Grasshoppers, was
   appointed. He re-signed legendary striker Jürgen Klinsmann, whose
   second spell proved a key factor in securing Premiership survival.

   George Graham was hired to lead the club before the 1998-99 season.
   Despite heavy criticism from club fans due to Graham's previous
   dealings with bitter rivals Arsenal, in his first season as Spurs
   manager the club secured a mid-table finish and won the League Cup by
   defeating Leicester City at Wembley. However, another mid-table league
   finish followed in 1999-2000.

   At the start of 2001, Sir Alan Sugar's patience broke. He sold his
   controlling interest in Tottenham to ENIC Sports PLC, run by Daniel
   Levy.

   Team management passed to Tottenham legend Glenn Hoddle who took over
   in April 2001 with the team lying thirteenth in the table. His first
   match in charge was an FA Cup semi-final defeat to rivals Arsenal.
   Another humiliation followed when club captain Sol Campbell defected to
   Arsenal on a Bosman free transfer. With limited funds to improve the
   squad Hoddle turned towards more experienced players in the shape of
   Teddy Sheringham, Gus Poyet and Christian Ziege for inspiration.

   Season 2001-02 saw an improvement, as Spurs finished in ninth place.
   However, a League Cup Final defeat to Blackburn Rovers left Hoddle
   under pressure for the following campaign. Only limited funds were
   available and the only significant outlay was £7 million for Robbie
   Keane, who joined from Leeds United. 2002-03 started well, with
   Tottenham remaining in the top six as late as early February. But with
   just seven points in the final ten games, the club finished in tenth
   place. Players publicly criticised Hoddle's management style and
   communication skills. Six games into the 2003-04 season, Hoddle was
   sacked and David Pleat took over on a caretaker basis until a full-time
   successor could be found.

   In May 2004, Tottenham signed French team manager Jacques Santini as
   head coach, with Martin Jol as his assistant and Frank Arnesen as
   Sporting Director. Despite much hype, Santini quit the club in bizarre
   circumstances after just 13 games in charge and was replaced by Jol. It
   didn't take long for the big Dutchman to become a favourite with the
   often fickle Spurs crowd and inspite of a 9th place finish in his first
   season, it was clear progress was being made and the club was heading
   in the right direction. However a change of plans was forced on Spurs
   when at the end of the season Frank Arnesen controversially headed to
   Chelsea, with Tottenham angrily accusing their London neighbours of
   tapping up their employee. With the threat of Premier League action
   looming, Chelsea eventually paid Spurs compensation of around £5
   million, with the latter swiftly appointing Damien Comolli as their new
   Sporting Director in September 2005 as Arnesen's replacement.

   2005-06 proved to be Spurs' best Premiership season to date. During the
   campaign the club spent six months in fourth place, which they only
   relinquished to rivals Arsenal on the last day of the season after a
   defeat to West Ham in a loss that was controversial as ten members of
   the Spurs first team had come down with a mysterious stomach bug only
   hours before kick off. Fans were left to settle for fifth position and
   a place in the UEFA Cup for the coming season. Although it wasn't the
   Champions League as hoped, the return to European football to the lane
   was welcomed by the fans.

   In the 2006-07 season, Tottenham beat Slavia Prague in the first round
   and then won their first three UEFA Cup group stage matches, including
   a resounding 2-0 win away at Turkish club Beşiktaş who gave the players
   a standing ovation after the game, and a 1-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen,
   thus qualifying for the knockout stages of the competition. On November
   5th, Tottenham beat the reigning champions Chelsea for the first time
   in the league since 1990, and in 19 years at White Hart Lane.

Club ownership

   Billionaire Joseph Lewis owns 29.8 per cent of the club through his
   investment company ENIC Sports Ltd. ENIC have also held significant
   stakes in SK Slavia Praha and AEK Athens. Daniel Levy, Lewis's partner,
   is Executive Chairman of the club, and it is widely believed by fans,
   players and management, that he has played a significant part in the
   club's turnaround, not least through the acquisition of players and of
   current Head Coach, Martin Jol. Former chairman Sir Alan Sugar retains
   a 13 per cent stake through Amshold Limited, while Stelios Haji-Ioannou
   has 9 per cent through Hodram Inc.

Tottenham Hotspur Ladies

   Tottenham's ladies team was founded in 1985 as Broxbourne Ladies. They
   started using the Tottenham Hotspur name for the 1991/2 season and play
   in the South-East & London Regional Women's League (the fourth tier of
   the game).

Support

   Tottenham have a large fanbase, with home matches traditionally
   attracting high attendances. In several seasons during the 1950s and
   1960s, Tottenham had the highest average attendance in England.^, In
   more recent years, attendances have been lower, partly due to the
   reduction in capacity caused by White Hart Lane's conversion to an
   all-seater stadium. In the 2005-06 season, Tottenham had the eighth
   largest average attendance in England.

   The club have a reputation for having a large Jewish following, with
   some Tottenham supporters referring to themselves as Yids a slang term
   for Jewish people deriving from Yiddish. The term was originally used
   as a racist provocation, but was co-opted by Spurs fans in the late
   1960s, after years of having had anti-semitic racial abuse directed at
   them by opposing supporters, to deflect its impact and to differentiate
   themselves from other clubs' fans. A small element among the Tottenham
   crowd (including many gentiles) developed the use of chants such as
   Yiddos! and Yid Army! in an effort to fire up the team.

   Tottenham's biggest rivalry is with fellow North London club Arsenal,
   against whom they contest the North London derby.
