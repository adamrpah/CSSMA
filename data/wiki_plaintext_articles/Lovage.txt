   L. Koch.

   Lovage (Levisticum officinale) is a plant, the leaves and "seeds" or
   fruit of which are used to flavor food, especially in South European
   cuisine. It is a tall (3 to 7ft) perennial that vaguely resembles
   celery in appearance and in flavor. Lovage also sometimes gets referred
   to as smallage, but this is more properly used for celery.

   The fruit of the lovage plant can be used as a spice, but what appears
   in the trade as lovage seed is usually ajwain, not lovage. On the other
   hand, what is sold as "celery seed" is often partially or entirely
   ground lovage seed.

   The root of lovage is used as a diuretic.

   In German, one of the common names of Lovage is Maggikraut because the
   plant's taste is reminiscent of Maggi soup seasoning.

   Lovage tea can be applied to wounds as an antiseptic, or drunk to
   stimulate digestion.
