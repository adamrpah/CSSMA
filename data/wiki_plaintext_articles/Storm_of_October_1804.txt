   1804 Atlantic hurricane season

   The Storm of October 1804 was a late-season major hurricane in the 1804
   Atlantic hurricane season that brought vast amounts of snow to New
   England as an extratropical storm in mid-October. The storm was the
   last of the only two tropical cyclones recorded that season.

   It killed at least 9 people, and caused $100,000+ (1804 USD,
   $1.2 million 2005  USD) in damage across much of the Northeast Coast of
   the United States. In addition, several ships were wrecked in Boston's
   Harbour.

Storm history

   Late in the 1804 Atlantic hurricane season, a major hurricane moved
   northwestward across the Western Atlantic. It passed by Virginia on
   October 8, and winds reached as far as Norfolk with winds of at least
   31 mph (50 km/h). One ship was reported to have passed through the
   gale, damage to the vessel is unknown. The system hit near Atlantic
   City, New Jersey, on October 9, and slowly curved east-northeastward,
   passing just north of New York City. After briefly passing through
   Connecticut into Massachusetts, cool air was entrained in the
   circulation, and it became extratropical. It continued east as it
   passed through Boston into the Gulf of Maine. It was last mentioned two
   days later, on October 11, probably over Atlantic Canada. An estimated
   track of the storm can be viewed here.

                                                               Area Deaths
                                                      Massachusetts      8

   The tropical cyclone brought blankets of snow to anywhere between New
   York and Southern Canada when it became extratropical. The storm
   brought heavy rain across the Atlantic states and southern New England,
   until it became extratropical and brought snow instead, in some areas
   up to two to three feet (610-910  mm). This was the first observation
   of snow from a landfalling hurricane, but not the last; Hurricane Ginny
   of 1963 brought up to 18 inches (400 mm) of snow to portions of Maine.
   In addition to the immense amounts of snow, the Storm of October 1804
   toppled fruit orchards everywhere. Thousands of fowl perished, and
   cattle and sheep died by the hundreds because of the frigid
   temperature. In total, the extratropical storm killed 9 people and
   caused at least $100,000 (1804 USD, $1.2 million (2005  USD) in damage.

Southern Mid-Atlantic States

   A vessel, the Rising Stakes, passed through the "dreadful squall" off
   of Cape Henry, but managed to escape without major damage. Many ships
   in Baltimore were beached after the rise and fall of the tide. In
   Atlantic City, New Jersey, a ship was driven ashore. In Trenton, a
   ferry capsized due to the high winds in the area. Philadelphia,
   Pennsylvania stated that one new ship sunk–quite a loss of money.

New York

   New York City received the worst recorded amount of snow from the
   storm; the pressure dropped from 992.5 mbar to 977.6 mbar over night.
   Rainfall totals reached 2.77 inches (70 mm). Once the system had become
   extratropical, New York received large amounts of snow across the whole
   state. In Bemis, New York, in the western section of New York, snow and
   rain was reported to have fallen. Farther eastward, 18 inches (460 mm)
   of snow was received in Catskill Mountains.

Southern New England

   In New Haven, Connecticut, a total rainfall accumulation of 3.66 inches
   (93 mm) was reported. After becoming extratropical, Litchfield reported
   3 inches (76 mm) of snow, while Goshen, reported one foot (305 mm).
   Rhode Island experienced stronger winds than ever remembered in
   Providence.

   In Massachusetts, 5-14 inches (127-356 mm) of snow was the average
   snowfall from the gale. But the Berkshire of Massachusetts reported two
   to three feet (610-910 mm) of snow. In Salem, 7 inches (178 mm) of rain
   was reported, more than ever before in a 24-hour period. The Gale of
   October 1804 was the worst tropical cyclone to affect Salem; it is not
   known if that record has been lost. The roof of the South Church in
   Danvers, Massachusetts was lost. And in Peabody, Massachusetts, over
   30,000 unfinished bricks were ruined. Many buildings in Boston,
   Massachusetts were destroyed, and one person died because of fallen
   roofs. Several ships in Boston's harbour were wrecked, causing loss of
   life.

   In Concord, New Hampshire, two feet (610 mm) of snow was recorded.
   Western New Hampshire along the Connecticut River was blanketed with
   18 inches (457 mm) of snow. As for the damage, Portsmouth only lost
   trees and fences to the storm. But Rye lost a person to the storm. A
   dead woman was found on the beach, with her child still in her hands.
   Whether the child was dead or alive at the time is unknown. The Vermont
   Journal estimated 36 to 48 inches (914-122 mm) in areas around Windsor,
   Vermont, and the northern area of Vermont, Lunenburg, Vermont, reported
   only 20 inches (508 mm). Thomaston, Maine had a sixty  acre (24.28
   hectares) lot of trees that was completely flattened by the time the
   storm had exited the area.

Miscellanea

     * The Old North Church in Boston lost its steeple. The replacement
       steeple — fifteen feet (4.6  m) shorter than the original —
       eventually fell victim to Hurricane Carol in 1954, 150 years later.
       The third and current steeple is a replica of the first.
