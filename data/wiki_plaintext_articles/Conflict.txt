Conflict

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Conflict and Peace

   Conflict is a state of opposition, disagreement or incompatibility
   between two or more people or groups of people, which is sometimes
   characterized by physical violence. Military conflict between states
   may constitute war.

Definitions

   In political terms, "conflict" refers to an ongoing state of hostility
   between two or more groups of people.

   Conflict as taught for graduate and professional work in conflict
   resolution commonly has the definition: "when two or more parties, with
   perceived incompatible goals, seek to undermine each other's
   goal-seeking capability".

   One should not confuse the distinction between the presence and absence
   of conflict with the difference between competition and co-operation.
   In competitive situations, the two or more parties each have mutually
   inconsistent goals, so that when either party tries to reach their goal
   it will undermine the attempts of the other to reach theirs. Therefore,
   competitive situations will by their nature cause conflict. However,
   conflict can also occur in cooperative situations, in which two or more
   parties have consistent goals, because the manner in which one party
   tries to reach their goal can still undermine the other.

   A clash of interests, values, actions or directions often sparks a
   conflict. Conflicts refer to the existence of that clash.
   Psychologically, a conflict exists when the reduction of one motivating
   stimulus involves an increase in another, so that a new adjustment is
   demanded. The word is applicable from the instant that the clash
   occurs. Even when we say that there is a potential conflict we are
   implying that there is already a conflict of direction even though a
   clash may not yet have occurred so to speak

Types and Modes of Conflict

   A conceptual conflict can escalate into a verbal exchange and/or result
   in fighting.

   Conflict can exist at a variety of levels of analysis:
     * intrapersonal conflict (though this usually just gets delegated out
       to psychology)
     * interpersonal conflict
     * emotional conflict
     * group conflict
     * organizational conflict
     * community conflict
     * intra-state conflict (for example: civil wars, election campaigns)
     * international conflict
     * environmental resources conflict
     * intersocietal conflict
     * intra-societal conflict
     * ideological conflict
     * diplomatic conflict
     * economic conflict
     * military conflict
     * religious-based conflict (for example: Centre For Reduction of
       Religious-Based Conflict)

   Conflicts in these levels may appear "nested" in conflicts residing at
   larger levels of analysis. For example, conflict within a work team may
   play out the dynamics of a broader conflict in the organization as a
   whole. (See Marie Dugan's article on Nested Conflict. John Paul
   Lederach has also written on this.)

   Theorists have claimed that parties can conceptualize responses to
   conflict according to a two-dimensional scheme; concern for one's own
   outcomes and concern for the outcomes of the other party. This scheme
   leads to the following hypotheses:
     * High concern for both one's own and the other party's outcomes
       leads to attempts to find mutually beneficial solutions.
     * High concern for one's own outcomes only leads to attempts to "win"
       the conflict.
     * High concern for the other party's outcomes only leads to allowing
       the other to "win" the conflict.
     * No concern for either side's outcomes leads to attempts to avoid
       the conflict.

   In Western society, practitioners usually suggest that attempts to find
   mutually beneficial solutions lead to the most satisfactory outcomes,
   but this may not hold true for many Asian societies.

   Several theorists detect successive phases in the development of
   conflicts.

   Often a group finds itself in conflict over facts, goals, methods or
   values. It is critical that it properly identify the type of conflict
   it is experiencing if it hopes to manage the conflict through to
   resolution. For example, a group will often treat an assumption as a
   fact.

   The more difficult type of conflict is when values are the root cause.
   It is more likely that a conflict over facts, or assumptions, will be
   resolved than one over values. It is extremely difficult to "prove"
   that a value is "right" or "correct".

   In some instances, a group will benefit from the use of a facilitator
   or process consultant to help identify the specific type of conflict.

   Practitioners of nonviolence have developed many practices to solve
   social and political conflicts without resorting to violence or
   coercion.

Examples

     * Approach-avoidance conflict is an example of intrapersonal
       conflict.

     * The Vietnam Conflict is commonly regarded as a war.

     * The Arab-Israeli conflict forms a historic and ongoing conflict
       between Israel and Arab interests. See also Israeli-Palestinian
       conflict.

     * The Catholic-Protestant conflict in Northern Ireland furnishes an
       example of another notable historic conflict. For information on
       the conflict, see the Troubles, Bloody Sunday (Northern Ireland
       1972), the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan Bombings and the 1998 Omagh
       bombing.

     * Many conflicts have a supposedly racial or ethnic basis. This would
       include such conflicts as the Bosnian-Croatian conflict (see
       Kosovo), the conflict in Rwanda.

     * Class conflict forms an important topic in much Marxist thought.

     * Another type of conflict exists between governments and guerrilla
       groups or groups engaged in asymmetric warfare.

Causes of Conflict

   Structural Factors (How the company is set up)
     * Specialization (The experts in fields)
     * Interdependance (A company as a whole can't operate w/o other
       departments)
     * Common Resources (Sharing the same secretary)
     * Goal Differences (One person wants production to rise and others
       want communication to rise)
     * Authority Relationships (The boss and employees beneath him/her)
     * Status Inconsistencies
     * Jurisdicational Ambiguities (Who can discipline who)

   Personal Factors
     * Skills and Abilities
     * Conflict management style
     * Personalities
     * Perception
     * Values and Ethics
     * Emotions
     * Communication barriers
     * Cultural Differences

   "Conflict is an emotionally defined and driven," and "does not exist in
   the absence of emotion."

   There are many components to the emotions that are intertwined with
   conflict. There is a behavioural, physiological, cognitive component.
     * Behavioural- The way emotional experience gets expressed which can
       be verbal or non-verbal and intentional or un-intentional.
     * Physiological- The bodily experience of emotion. The way emotions
       make us feel in comparison to our identity.
     * Cognitive- The idea that we “assess or appraise” an event to reveal
       its relevancy to ourselves.

   These three components collectively advise that “the meanings of
   emotional experience and expression are determined by cultural values,
   beliefs, and practices.”
     * Cultural values- culture tells people who are a part of it, “Which
       emotions ought to be expressed in particular situations” and “what
       emotions are to be felt.”
     * Physical- This escalation results from “anger or frustration.”
     * Verbal- This escalation results from “negative perceptions of the
       annoyer’s character.”

   There are several principles of conflict and emotion.
     * 1. Conflict is emotionally Defined-conflict involves emotion
       because something “triggers” it. The conflict is with the parties
       involved and how they decide to resolve it “Events that trigger
       conflict are events that elicit emotion.”
     * 2. Conflict is emotionally Valenced- Emotion levels during conflict
       can be intense or less intense. The “intensity” levels “may be
       indicative of the importance and meaning of the conflict issues for
       each” party.
     * 3. Conflict Invokes a Moral Stance- When an event occurs it can be
       interpreted as moral or immoral. The judging of this morality
       “Influences one’s orientation to the conflict, relationship to the
       parties involved, and the conflict issues”.
     * 4. Conflict is Identity based- Emotions and Identity are a part of
       conflict. When a person knows there values, beliefs, and morals
       they are able to determine whether the conflict is personal,
       relevant, and moral. “Identity related conflicts are potentially
       more destructive.”
     * 5. Conflict is Relational- “conflict is relational in the sense
       that emotional communication conveys relational definitions that
       impact conflict.” “Key relational elements are power and social
       status.”

   Emotions are acceptable in the workplace as long as they can be
   controlled and utilized for productive organizational outcomes.
