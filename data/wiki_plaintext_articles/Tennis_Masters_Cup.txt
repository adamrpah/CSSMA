Tennis Masters Cup

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Sports events

   The Tennis Masters Cup is a tennis tournament played annually at the
   end of each year, involving the top eight players in the men's tennis
   world rankings.

   Unlike all the other events on the men's tour, the Tennis Masters Cup
   is not a straightforward knock-out tournament. The eight players are
   divided into two groups of four, and play three round-robin matches
   each against the other three players in their group. From there, the
   two players with the best records in each group progress to the
   semi-finals, with the semi-final winners meeting in the final to
   determine the champion.

   The event is actually the third evolution of a championship which began
   in 1970. It was originally known simply as The Masters tournament, and
   was organised by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The Masters
   was a year-end showpiece event between the best players on the men's
   tour, but did not count for any world ranking points. In 1990, the
   Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) took over the running of the
   men's tour and replaced the Masters with the ATP Tour World
   Championship. World ranking points were now at stake, with an
   undefeated champion earning the same number of points they would for
   winning one of the four Grand Slam events. The ITF, who continued to
   run the Grand Slam tournaments, created a rival year-end event known as
   the Grand Slam Cup, which was contested by the 16 players with the best
   records in Grand Slam competitions that year. In December 1999, the ATP
   and ITF agreed to discontinue the two separate events and create a new
   jointly-owned event called the Tennis Masters Cup. As with the Masters
   and the ATP Tour World Championships, the Tennis Masters Cup is
   contested by eight players. However under the rules of the Tennis
   Masters Cup, the player who is ranked number eight in the ATP
   Champion's Race world rankings does not have a guaranteed spot. If a
   player who wins one of the year's Grand Slam events finishes the year
   ranked outside the top eight but still within the top 20, he can be
   included in the Tennis Masters Cup instead of the eight-ranked player.
   If two players outside the top eight win Grand Slam events, the higher
   placed player in the world rankings will take the final spot in the
   Tennis Masters Cup.

   For many years, the doubles event was held as a separate tournament the
   week after the singles competition. But more recently they have been
   held together in the same week and venue. Like the singles competition,
   the doubles involves the eight most successful teams on the tour each
   year and starts with a group phase with each team playing three
   round-robin matches.
