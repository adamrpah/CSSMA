   Tropical Storm Franklin was a tropical storm over the western Atlantic
   Ocean during July of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the
   sixth named storm of the season and twice approached hurricane
   strength.

   The storm formed over the Bahamas on July 21 then moved north
   erratically, approaching Bermuda on July 26. Franklin eventually became
   extratropical near Newfoundland on July 30, before being absorbed by a
   larger system. The National Hurricane Centre struggled to predict
   Tropical Storm Franklin mainly due difficulties in predicting the
   effects of wind shear. There were only minor effects on land from
   Tropical Storm Franklin and no damages were caused.

Storm history

   Storm path

   A tropical wave emerged from the African coast late on July 10. The
   wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and organized into Tropical
   Depression Six while 70 miles (110 km) east of Eleuthera. Initially the
   storm was predicted to execute a clockwise loop and drift to the west
   in response to a high pressure system. Several models indicated the
   possibility of the storm to drift westward into central Florida. Soon
   after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm
   Franklin.

   Tropical Storm Franklin suffered high levels of wind shear associated
   with the development of Tropical Storm Gert, which led the forecasters
   at the National Hurricane Centre to say that Franklin could be torn
   apart in the next few days. However the shear abated as Franklin moved
   to the northeast allowing the storm to strengthen. The forecasters now
   said that Franklin could "attain and maintain hurricane strength" and
   make a close approach to Bermuda. Shortly after on July 23, Tropical
   Storm Franklin reached its peak strength with 70 mph (110 km/h) winds.

   Franklin moved erratically to the east weakening as shear increased
   again. The NHC predicted that would dissipate, but the weakening trend
   stopped on July 25 with Franklin a minimal tropical storm. The storm
   passed to 200 miles (325 km) to the west of Bermuda on July 26 and
   moved slowly northwards into the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream. The
   shear also reduced once again allowing Franklin to re-strengthen
   somewhat, with winds reaching 60 mph (95 km/h) on July 28. Franklin
   began to accelerate to the northeast becoming extratropical on July 30
   to the south of Newfoundland. The extratropical storm passed just south
   of the Avalon Peninsula later that day and was absorbed by a larger
   system on July 31.

Impact

   As Tropical Storm Franklin was forming, a tropical storm warning was
   issued for the northwest Bahamas, but it was cancelled as Franklin
   moved north and away from the islands. A tropical storm watch was
   issued for Bermuda on July 25 but was cancelled a day later when
   Franklin turned away.

   Tropical Storm Franklin developed very close to land in the Bahamas and
   passed near Bermuda, but there were no reports of tropical storm force
   winds overland, with the strongest gust recorded on Bermuda being 37
   mph (60 km/h). After Franklin became extratropical, it brushed
   southeastern Newfoundland, bringing about 1 inch (25 mm) of rain to the
   area. There were no damages or fatalities as a result of Tropical Storm
   Franklin.

Naming and records

   When Franklin formed on July 21, it was the earliest ever in a season
   that the sixth tropical storm formed, beating the previous record held
   by storm 6 of the 1936 season by 14 days. This was the first use of
   Franklin to name a tropical storm following the retirement of Hurricane
   Floyd of the 1999 season. Due to the lack of any major impact from
   Tropical Storm Franklin, the name was not retired by the World
   Meteorological Organization and will be on the list of names for the
   2011 Season.
