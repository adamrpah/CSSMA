Manufacturing

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Business

   Manufacturing, a branch of industry, is the application of tools and a
   processing medium to the transformation of raw materials into finished
   goods for sale. This effort includes all intermediate processes
   required for the production and integration of a product's components.
   Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the
   term fabrication instead. The manufacturing sector is closely connected
   with engineering. Manufacturing accounts for about one-quarter of the
   world's economic activity .

   According to some unorthodox economists, manufacturing is a wealth
   producing sector of an economy, whereas a service sector tends to be
   wealth consuming. Emerging technologies have provided some new growth
   in advanced manufacturing employment opportunities in the Manufacturing
   Belt in the United States. Manufacturing provides important material
   support for national infrastructure and for national defense.

   On the other hand, some manufacturing may involve significant social
   and environmental costs. The clean-up costs of hazardous waste, for
   example, may outweigh the benefits. Hazardous materials may expose
   workers to health risks. Developed countries regulate manufacturing
   activity with labor laws and environmental laws. In the United States,
   manufacturers are subject to regulations by the Occupational Safety and
   Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. In
   Europe, pollution taxes to offset environmental costs are another form
   of regulation on manufacturing activity. Labor Unions and craft guilds
   have played a historic role negotiation of worker rights and wages.
   Environment laws and labor protections that are available in developed
   nations may not be available in the third world. Tort law and product
   liability impose additional costs on manufacturing.

   Examples of major manufacturers in the United States include General
   Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, Boeing, Gates Rubber
   Company and Pfizer. Examples in Europe include France's Airbus and
   Michelin Tire. Modern proponents of Fair Trade policy and a strong
   manufacturing base for the U.S. economy inlude economists like Paul
   Craig Roberts, Ravi Batra, and Lou Dobbs.

History and development

   herhandicraft]] production has existed for many millennia, modern-style
   manufacturing is generally regarded as beginning around 1780 with the
   British Industrial Revolution, spreading thereafter to Continental
   Europe and North America, and subsequently around the world.
   Originally, the term applied to commodities or artifacts which were
   "made by hand".
