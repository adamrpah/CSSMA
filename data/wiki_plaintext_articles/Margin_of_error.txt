   The top portion of this graphic depicts probability densities that show
   the relative likelihood that the "true" percentage is in a particular
   area given a reported percentage of 50%. The bottom portion of this
   graphic shows the margin of error, the corresponding zone of 99 %
   confidence. In other words, one is 99% sure that the "true" percentage
   is in this region given a poll with the sample size shown to the right.
   The larger the sample is, the smaller the margin of error is. If lower
   standards of confidence (95 or 90 %) are used, the margins of error
   will be smaller (by 24 or 36%, respectively) for the same sample sizes.

   The top portion of this graphic depicts probability densities that show

   is in this region given a poll with the sample size shown to the right.
   The larger the sample is, the smaller the margin of error is. If lower
   standards of confidence (95 or 90 %) are used, the margins of error
   will be smaller (by 24 or 36%, respectively) for the same sample sizes.

   The margin of error expresses the amount of the random variation
   underlying a survey's results. This can be thought of as a measure of
   the variation one would see in reported percentages if the same poll
   were taken multiple times. The larger the margin of error, the less
   confidence one has that the poll's reported percentages are close to
   the "true" percentages, that is the percentages in the whole
   population.

   A margin of error can be calculated for each figure produced from a
   sample survey, unless a nonprobability sample is used. For results
   expressed as percentages, it is often possible to calculate a maximum
   margin of error that applies to all results from the survey (or at
   least all results based on the full sample). The maximum margin of
   error can sometimes be calculated directly from the sample size (the
   number of poll respondents).

   A margin of error is usually prepared for one of three different levels
   of confidence; 99%, 95% and 90%. The 99% level is the most
   conservative, while the 90% level is the least conservative. The 95%
   level is the most commonly used. If the level of confidence is 95%, the
   "true" percentage for the entire population would be within the margin
   of error around a poll's reported percentage 95% of the time.
   Equivalently, the margin of error is the radius of the 95% confidence
   interval.

   Note that the margin of error only takes into account random sampling
   error. It does not take into account other potential sources of error
   such as bias in the questions, bias due to excluding groups who could
   not be contacted, people refusing to respond or lying, or miscounts and
   miscalculations.

Calculations and caveats

   For a simple random sample, the maximum margin of error is a simple
   re-expression of the sample size n. The numerators of these equations
   are rounded to two decimal places.

          Margin of error at 99% confidence \approx 1.29/\sqrt{n}\,

          Margin of error at 95% confidence \approx 0.98/\sqrt{n}\,

          Margin of error at 90% confidence \approx 0.82/\sqrt{n}\,

   These formulae only apply if the survey used a simple random sample.
   Often a simple random sample is not possible, because it involves
   selecting respondents from a list of everyone in the population, and
   this is not often available. Instead multistage sample designs are
   used, which may involve stratification, clustering and unequal
   selection probabilities. All of these practices will affect the margin
   of error.

   The margin of error is not fully defined if the confidence level is not
   reported. If an article about a poll does not report the confidence
   level, but does state that a simple random sample of a certain size was
   used, the margin of error can be calculated to a desired degree of
   confidence given the reported sample size. Also, if the 95% margin of
   error is given, one can find the 99% margin of error by increasing its
   width by about 30%. If an article reports neither the confidence level
   nor the sample size, readers should only assume a particular level of
   confidence for casual, low-stakes interpretations.

   The maximum margin of error is a poll-level statistic that should not
   be used to evaluate or compare reported percentages. However, due to
   its unfortunate name (it neither establishes a "margin" nor is the
   whole of "error"), it has become one of the most widely overinterpreted
   statistics in general use by the media. It is frequently misused to
   judge whether one percentage is " significantly" higher than another or
   not, and to specify the error associated with reported percentages
   other than 50%.

Understanding the margin of error

A running example

   This running example from the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign will be
   used to illustrate concepts throughout this article. It should be clear
   that the choice of poll and who is leading is irrelevant to the
   presentation of the concepts. According to an October 2 survey by
   Newsweek, 47 % of registered voters would vote for John Kerry/ John
   Edwards if the election were held today. 45% would vote for George W.
   Bush/ Dick Cheney, and 2 % would vote for Ralph Nader/ Peter Camejo.
   The size of the sample is 1,013, and the reported margin of error is ±4
   %. The 99 % level of confidence will be used for the remainder of this
   article.

The basic concept

   Polls require taking samples from populations. In the case of the
   Newsweek poll, the population of interest is the population of people
   who will vote. Since it is impractical to poll everyone who will vote,
   pollsters take smaller samples that are intended to be representative,
   that is, a random sample of the population. It is possible that
   pollsters happen to sample 1,013 voters who happen to vote for Bush
   when in fact the population is split, but this is extremely unlikely
   given that the sample is random.

   Given the size of the sample (1,013), probability theory allows the
   calculation of the probability that the poll reports 47 % for Kerry but
   is in fact 50 %, or is in fact 42 %. This theory and some Bayesian
   assumptions suggest that the "true" percentage will probably be very
   close to 47 %. The more people that are sampled, the more confident
   pollsters can be that the "true" percentage is closer and closer to the
   observed percentage. The margin of error is a rough, poll-wide
   expression of that confidence.

Statistical terms and calculations

   The margin of error is just a specific 99 % confidence interval, which
   is in turn a simple manipulation of the standard error of measurement.
   This section will briefly discuss the standard error of a percentage,
   briefly discuss the confidence interval, and connect these two concepts
   to the margin of error.

   The standard error can be estimated simply given a proportion or
   percentage, p, and the number of polled respondents, n. In the case of
   the Newsweek poll, Kerry's percentage, p = 0.47 and n = 1,013. Given
   some statistical theory outlined below, the following holds:

          Standard error = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}

   The standard error (.016 or 1.6 %) helps to give a sense of the
   accuracy of Kerry's estimated percentage (47 %). A helpful, Bayesian
   interpretation of the standard error is that the "true" percentage
   (unknown) is highly likely to be located somewhere around the estimated
   percentage (47 %). The standard error can be used to create a
   confidence interval within which the "true" percentage should be to a
   certain level of confidence.

   Plus or minus 1 standard error is a 68 % confidence interval, plus or
   minus 2 standard errors is approximately a 95 % confidence interval,
   and a 99 % confidence interval is 2.58 standard errors on either side
   of the estimate.

   The margin of error is the radius (half) of the 99 % confidence
   interval, or 2.58 standard errors, when p = 50 %. As such, it can be
   calculated directly from the number of poll respondents.

          Margin of error (99%) = 2.58 × \sqrt{\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n}} =
          \frac{1.29}{\sqrt{n}}

   To conclude, the margin of error is the 99 % confidence interval for a
   reported percentage of 50 %. If p moves away from 50 %, the confidence
   interval around p will be smaller. Thus, the margin of error represents
   an upper bound to the uncertainty; one is at least 99 % certain that
   the "true" percentage is within a margin of error of a reported
   percentage for any reported percentage.

The use and abuse of the margin of error

   The margin of error grew out of a well-intentioned need to compare the
   accuracy of different polls. However, its widespread use in high-stakes
   polling has degraded from comparing polls to comparing reported
   percentages, a use that is not supported by theory. A web search of
   news articles using the terms "statistical tie" or "statistical dead
   heat" returns many articles that use these terms to describe reported
   percentages that differ by less than a margin of error. These terms are
   misleading; if one observed percentage is greater than another, the
   true percentages in the entire population are more likely ordered in
   the same way than not. In addition, the margin of error as generally
   calculated is applicable to an *individual percentage* and not the
   difference between percentages. (The margin of error applicable
   directly to the "lead" is very approximately equal to twice the
   generally stated margin of error, but this is exactly the case only for
   a two-choice poll with a result of 50% for each choice). The margin of
   error is often interpreted as if the poll gives either no information
   (a difference within a margin of error) or perfect information (a
   difference larger than a margin of error) about the ranking of two
   percentages in the population, but this is a gross oversimplification.
   As the margin of error continues to be inappropriately applied, simpler
   alternatives (sample size) or more complex alternatives (standard
   error, probability of leading) may be warranted.

Incorrect interpretations of the margin of error

   Here are some incorrect interpretations of the margin of error based on
   the Newsweek poll.
     * Kerry and Bush are "statistically tied" or are in a "statistical
       dead heat".
     * It only "matters" if Kerry leads Bush (or vice versa) by more than
       4 %.
     * Any change in the percentages for future polls does not "matter"
       unless it is more than 4 %.
     * Because Nader got 2 % and the margin of error is 4 %, he could
       potentially have 0 %.
     * The margin of error is the same for every percentage, i.e. 47% ±
       4%, 45% ± 4%, 2% ± 4%.

Arguments for the use of the margin of error

     * For casual comparisons of different polls, it is helpful to define
       a benchmark (99 % confidence interval radius for an estimated
       percentage of 50 %) that reflects the sampling variance of the
       poll.
          + Although the sampling variance does decrease linearly with
            increasing numbers of respondents, the margin of error
            decreases linearly with the square root of n, so using the
            number of respondents as an inverse measure of standard error
            can be confusing.
     * If results from two polls are separated by more than 1.4 times the
       margin of error, then we can state with similar confidence that the
       larger value is in fact larger in the population, without any
       complex calculations.

Arguments against the use of the margin of error

     * The margin of error is a simple transformation of the number of
       respondents into an ambiguous term that is neither a "margin" nor
       the whole of "error".
     * The margin of error is being confused with the confidence interval
       of reported percentages.
          + The 99 % confidence interval radius for any percentage besides
            50 % is smaller than the maximum margin of error.
          + It is much smaller and more asymmetric for very high and very
            low percentages.
     * It is not a "margin" at all; the probability of the true percentage
       being outside the margin of error is low but nonzero.
     * There is no agreed-upon confidence level. Most pollsters use 99 %,
       but many use 95 % or 90 %; this makes their polls look more
       accurate.
     * Many pollsters fail to account for the complexity of their sample
       design when calculating the margin of error, which usually makes
       their polls appear more accurate than they truly are.
     * When the purpose of polls is to compare percentages, the use of the
       margin of error is tempting, but is inappropriate if the two
       intervals overlap.
     * Perhaps most importantly, there are many different sources of error
       in polling, and variance due to sample size is not likely to be the
       only contribution. Other possible contributions to error include:
          + Sampling bias, when the sample is not a representative sample
            from the population of interest. In particular, certain people
            may choose not to participate.
          + The phrasing of the question may not be appropriate for the
            conclusions of the poll.
          + Response error (Sudman & Bradburn, 1982)
               o Deliberate distortion (fear of consequences, social
                 desirability, response acquiescence).
               o Misconstrual (not understanding the question).
               o Lack of knowledge (guessing to try to be helpful).

Margin of error and population size

   An interesting mathematical fact is that the margin of error depends
   only on the sample size and not on the population size, provided that
   the population is significantly larger than the sample size, and
   provided a simple random sample is used. Thus for instance, the poll in
   the running example with 1,013 randomly sampled registered voters would
   yield essentially the same margin of error (4% with a 99% level of
   confidence) regardless of whether the population of registered voters
   consisted of 100,000 people or 100,000,000 people.

   This may seem counter-intuitive at first; after all, each person in the
   population has a unique personality and opinion, and in a very large
   population, only a very small fraction of such people would actually be
   polled, and it would thus seem that the poll is not capturing enough
   information. However, because a poll involves only a very specific
   question, there is only one relevant attribute in the population that
   needs to be considered, and this means that an individual's opinion is
   effectively equivalent to those of many other members of the
   population, some fraction of which will be polled. For instance, in the
   running example, the only relevant attribute of a population member is
   whether he or she is a Bush voter, a Kerry voter, or a Nader voter -
   all other characteristics of a population member are irrelevant. Thus
   for instance if there are 100,000,000 registered voters, and 48,000,000
   of them were Kerry voters, then for the purposes of this statistical
   analysis all of the 48,000,000 individuals in this group would be
   completely interchangeable and equivalent. An individual Kerry voter
   has 47,999,999 other voters with identical opinions (as far as the poll
   question is concerned), and it is exceedingly likely that a poll of
   1,013 voters will contain a properly representative fraction of this
   group, provided of course that the voters being polled were selected
   randomly.

   To give an analogy, suppose that one is trying to estimate the
   percentage of salt in an ocean. This can be easily accomplished by
   taking a glass of seawater and then chemically analyzing the proportion
   of salt in that sample. The amount of salt and water in this glass is
   far smaller than the amount of salt and water in the ocean under study.
   Nevertheless, the sample is likely to give a very accurate measurement
   of the ocean's salinity, provided of course that the salt is evenly
   distributed across the ocean (this hypothesis is the analogue of the
   hypothesis that the poll sample is being randomly chosen). In fact, one
   could already obtain a crude but reasonable estimate of salinity by
   testing just a single drop of seawater, though of course the larger
   sample in the glass would provide a more accurate measurement. This
   analogy may help explain why it is the sample size, rather than the
   population size, that determines the margin of error in a poll.

Comparing percentages: the probability of leading

Tables

   The margin of error is frequently misused to determine whether one
   percentage is higher than another. The statistic that should be used is
   simply the probability that one percentage is higher than another. This
   can tentatively be called the Probability of Leading. Here is a table
   that gives the percentage probability of leading for two candidates, in
   the absence of any other candidates, assuming 95% confidence levels are
   used:
   Difference of percentages: 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10%
   1% margin of error 50.0 83.6 97.5 99.8 100 100 100 100 100 100 100
   2% margin of error 50.0 68.8 83.7 92.9 97.5 99.3 99.8 100 100 100 100

   8% margin of error 50.0 54.9 59.7 64.3 68.8 73.0 76.9 80.5 83.7 86.6
   89.1
   9% margin of error 50.0 54.3 58.6 62.8 66.9 70.7 74.4 77.8 80.9 83.7
   86.3

   83.8

   For example, the probability that Kerry is leading Bush given the data
   from the Newsweek poll (a 2% difference and a 4% margin of error) is
   about 68.8%, provided they used a 95% confidence level. Note that the
   100% entries in the table are actually slightly less. Here is the same
   table for the 99% confidence level:
   Difference of percentages: 0% 1% 2% 3% 4% 5% 6% 7% 8% 9% 10%
   1% margin of error 50.0 90.1 99.5 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100
   2% margin of error 50.0 74.1 90.2 97.4 99.5 99.9 100 100 100 100 100
   3% margin of error 50.0 66.6 80.5 90.2 95.7 98.4 99.5 99.9 100 100 100
   4% margin of error 50.0 62.6 74.1 83.3 90.2 94.7 97.4 98.8 99.5 99.8
   99.9
   5% margin of error 50.0 60.2 69.7 78.1 84.9 90.2 94.0 96.5 98.1 99.0
   99.5
   6% margin of error 50.0 58.5 66.6 74.1 80.5 85.9 90.2 93.4 95.8 97.4
   98.5
   7% margin of error 50.0 57.3 64.4 71.0 77.0 82.2 86.6 90.2 93.0 95.2
   96.8
   8% margin of error 50.0 56.4 62.6 68.6 74.1 79.0 83.4 87.1 90.2 92.7
   94.7
   9% margin of error 50.0 55.7 61.3 66.6 71.7 76.3 80.6 84.3 87.5 90.2
   92.5
   10% margin of error 50.0 55.1 60.2 65.1 69.7 74.1 78.1 81.7 85.0 87.8
   90.3

   If the Newsweek poll used a 99% confidence level, the probability that
   Kerry is leading Bush rises to about 74.1%. It is evident that the
   confidence level has a significant impact on the probability of
   leading.

Derivation

   The rest of this section shows how the Newsweek percentage might be
   calculated. This probability can be derived with 1) the standard error
   calculation introduced earlier, 2) the formula for the variance of the
   difference of two random variables, and 3) an assumption that if anyone
   does not choose Kerry they will choose Bush, and vice versa, i.e. they
   are perfectly negatively correlated. This assumption may not be tenable
   given that a voter could be undecided or vote for Nader, but the
   results will still be illustrative.

   The standard error of the difference of percentages p for Kerry and q
   for Bush, assuming that they are perfectly negatively correlated,
   follows:

          Standard error of difference =
          \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)+q(1-q)+2pq}{n}}.

   Given the actual percentage difference p − q (2% or 0.02) and the
   standard error of the difference calculated above (.03), use a program
   like Microsoft Excel to calculate the probability that a sample from a
   normal distribution with mean 0.02 and standard deviation 0.03 is
   greater than 0.

   These calculations suggest that the probability that Kerry is "truly"
   leading is 74%.

More advanced calculations behind the margin of error

   Let n be the number of voters in the sample. Suppose them to have been
   drawn randomly and independently from the whole population of voters.
   This is perhaps optimistic, but if care is taken it can be at least
   approximated in reality. Let p be the proportion of voters in the whole
   population who will vote "yes". Then the number X of voters in the
   sample who will vote "yes" is a random variable with a binomial
   distribution with parameters n and p. If n is large enough, then X is
   approximately normally distributed with expected value np and variance
   np(1 − p). Therefore

          Z=\frac{X-np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}

   is approximately normally distributed with expected value 0 and
   variance 1. Consulting tabulated percentage points of the normal
   distribution reveals that P(−2.576 < Z < 2.576) = 0.99, or, in other
   words, there is a 99 % chance of this event. So,

          P\left(-2.576<\frac{X/n-p}{\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}}<2.576\right)=0.99.

   This is equivalent to

          P\left(\frac{X}{n}-2.576\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}<p<\frac{X}{n}+2.
          576\sqrt{ \frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\ \right)=0.99.

   Replacing p in the first and third members of this inequality by the
   estimated value X/n seldom results in large errors if n is big enough.
   This operation yields

          P\left(\frac{X}{n}-2.576\sqrt{\frac{(X/n)(1-(X/n))}{n}}<p<\frac{
          X}{n}+2.576\sqrt{\frac{(X/n)(1-(X/n))}{n}}\ \right)=0.99.

   The first and third members of this inequality depend on the observable
   X/n and not on the unobservable p, and are the endpoints of the
   confidence interval. In other words, the margin of error is

          2.576\sqrt{\frac{(X/n)(1-(X/n))}{n}}.
