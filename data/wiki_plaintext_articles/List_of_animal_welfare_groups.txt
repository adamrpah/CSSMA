List of animal welfare groups

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Animal & Human Rights

   Animal welfare groups argue for greater protection for non-human
   animals, particularly those used by human beings in laboratories or in
   entertainment, as well as domestic animals such as those used for food,
   labour, or as companions ( pets).

   Unlike animal rights groups, animal welfare groups do not argue that
   animals should never be used, or kept as property, by human beings. Nor
   do any animal welfare groups advocate violence. These groups tend to
   seek legal, social and financial strategies.
