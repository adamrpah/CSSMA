   The City and County of Denver is the most populous city, the second
   most populous county, and the capital of the State of Colorado. Denver
   is located in the South Platte River Valley on the High Plains just
   east of the Front Range of the Southern Rocky Mountains. The Denver
   downtown district is located immediately east of the confluence of
   Cherry Creek with the South Platte River, approximately 15 miles (24
   kilometers) east of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Denver has a
   consolidated city and county government. Residents of Denver are known
   as Denverites.

   The United States Census Bureau estimates that in 2005 the population
   of the City and County of Denver was 557,917 (25th most populous U.S.
   city), the population of the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Statistical
   Area was 2,359,994 (22nd most populous MSA), and the population of the
   Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area was 2,869,377 (19th
   most populous CSA). Denver is the most populous city within a radius of
   550 miles (885 kilometers), and the Denver Metropolitan Area is the
   most populous in the Rocky Mountain Region of North America. The city
   claims to have the 10th largest downtown district in the United States.

   Denver is nicknamed "The Mile-High City" because its official
   elevation, engraved on the fifteenth step of the state capitol
   building, is one statute mile (5280 feet or 1609 meters) above sea
   level. The elevation of Denver International Airport is 5431 feet (1655
   meters).

   Denver has also been known historically as the Queen City of the Plains
   because of its important role in the agricultural industry of the
   plains regions along the foothills of the Front Range. Other nicknames
   that Denver has had include The Rail City, for the city's importance as
   a North American rail hub, and Capital of the Rocky Mountain Empire,
   for the city's preeminence in the Rocky Mountain region. Several US
   Navy ships have been named USS Denver in honour of the city.

History

   Kansas Territorial Governor James W. Denver never saw his namesake
   city.

   Kansas Territorial Governor James W. Denver never saw his namesake
   city.

   Denver was founded in the Kansas Territory in 1858. That summer a group
   from Lawrence, Kansas, arrived and established Montana City on the
   banks of the South Platte River. This was the first settlement in what
   was later to become the city of Denver. The site faded quickly,
   however, and was abandoned in favour of Auraria and St. Charles City by
   the summer of 1859. The site is now Grant-Frontier Park and includes
   mining equipment and a log cabin replica.

   On November 22, 1858, General William Larimer, a land speculator from
   eastern Kansas, placed cottonwood logs to stake a claim on the hill
   overlooking the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek,
   across the creek from the existing mining settlement of Auraria.
   Larimar named the townsite Denver City in honour of Kansas Territorial
   Governor James W. Denver. Larimer hoped that the town's name would help
   make it the county seat of Arapaho County, but ironically Governor
   Denver had already resigned from office. The location was accessible to
   existing trails and was across the South Platte River from the site of
   seasonal encampments of the Cheyenne and Arapaho. The site of these
   first towns is now the site of Confluence Park in downtown Denver.
   Larimer, along with associates in the St. Charles City Land Company,
   sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners, with the intention of
   creating a major city that would cater to new emigrants. Denver City
   was a frontier town, with an economy based on servicing local miners
   with gambling, saloons, livestock and goods trading. In the early
   years, land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by
   miners in Auraria.

   the 19th century.

   The Colorado Territory was created on February 28, 1861, Arapahoe
   County was formed on November 1, 1861, and Denver City was incorporated
   on November 7, 1861. Denver City served as the Arapahoe County Seat
   until 1902. In 1865, Denver City became the Territorial Capital, and on
   August 1, 1876, Denver (no longer needing to call itself Denver City)
   became the State Capital when Colorado was admitted to the Union.

   Between 1880-1895 the city experienced a huge rise in city corruption,
   as crime bosses, such as Soapy Smith, worked side-by-side with elected
   officials and the police, to control the elections, gambling, and the
   bunko gangs. By 1890, Denver had grown to be the second largest city
   west of Omaha, Nebraska, second only to San Francisco. It would lose
   the title at the turn of the century to Los Angeles, however. In 1887,
   the precursor to the international charity United Way was formed in
   Denver by local religious leaders who fundraised and coordinated
   various charities to help Denver's poor.

   The era of the 1890s played an important role in Denver's history, as
   this is when the city began to take on a "big city" image. On November
   15, 1902, Arapahoe County was split into the new consolidated City and
   County of Denver, the new Adams County, and the renamed South Arapahoe
   County. The 1908 Democratic National Convention was staged to promote
   Denver's prominence, and to signify the city's participation on the
   national political and socioeconomic stage.

   Denver was selected to host the 1976 Winter Olympics to coincide with
   Colorado's centennial anniversary, but Colorado voters struck down
   ballot initiatives allocating public funds to pay for the high costs of
   the games, so they were moved to Innsbruck, Austria. The infamy of
   becoming the only city ever to decline to host an Olympiad after being
   selected has made subsequent bids difficult. The movement against
   hosting the games was based largely on environmental issues and was led
   by then State Representative Richard Lamm. Lamm was subsequently
   elected as Colorado governor in 1974. Beat icon Neal Cassady was raised
   on Larimer Street in Denver, and a portion of Jack Kerouac's beat
   masterpiece On the Road takes place in the city, and is based on the
   beat's actual experiences in Denver during a road trip. Beat poet Allen
   Ginsberg lived for a time in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, and he
   helped found the Buddhist college, Naropa University or the "Jack
   Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa" in nearby Boulder.

   Denver is located at 39°43′35″N, 104°57′56″W^ GR1 in the Colorado Front
   Range region, between the Rocky Mountains to the west and the Great
   Plains to the east. According to the United States Census Bureau, the
   city has a total area of 401.3 km² (154.9 mi²), of which 4.1 km² (1.6
   mi²), or 1.03%, is water.

Climate

   Denver has a semi-arid climate with four distinct seasons. While Denver
   is located on the Great Plains, the weather of the city and surrounding
   area is heavily influenced by the proximity of the Rocky Mountains to
   the west. The climate, while generally mild compared to the mountains
   to the west and the plains further east, can be very unpredictable.
   Measurable amounts of snow have fallen in Denver as late as Memorial
   Day and as early as Labor Day, and trace amounts have been recorded in
   every month of the year.
   Thunderstorms are a common sight in Denver.

   The average temperature in Denver is 50.1 °F (10.1 °C), and the average
   yearly precipitation is 15.81 in (402 mm). The season's first snowfall
   generally occurs around October 19, and the last snowfall is about
   April 27, averaging 61.6 in (156 cm) of seasonal accumulation. Although
   Denver's Convention and Visitor Bureau claims Denver receives over 300
   sunny days a year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   places that figure at about 250 days of sunshine a year.

   Denver's winters can vary from mild to cold, and although large amounts
   of snow can fall on the mountains just west of the city, the effects of
   orographic lift dry out the air passing over the Front Range, shadowing
   the city from precipitation for much of the season. Additionally, warm
   chinook winds can occasionally be felt as air passing over the
   mountains heats as it descends. Nevertheless, winters are generally
   mild, with the coldest temperature ever recorded in Denver was recorded
   on January 9, 1875 at -29 °F (-34 °C), though the last time Denver
   recorded a temperature below -20 °F (-29 °C) was in 1990.

   Spring brings with it significant changes as Denver can be affected by
   air masses on all sides, whether arctic air from the north, which
   occasionally combines with Pacific storm fronts bringing snow to the
   city. In fact, March is Denver's snowiest month, averaging 11.7 in
   (29.7 cm) of snow. Additionally, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico can
   bring the first thunderstorms of the season, and continental warm air
   can bring summer-like warm and dry conditions.

   Starting in mid-July, the monsoon brings tropical moisture into the
   city and with it come frequent short (and occasionally severe)
   late-afternoon thunderstorms. However, despite this tropical moisture,
   humidity levels during the day generally remain very low. The average
   high during the summer is 85 °F (29 °C) and the average low is 56 °F
   (13 °C).

   In the autumn, the tropical monsoon flow dies down and as arctic air
   begins to approach, it can combine with moisture from the Pacific
   Northwest to bring significant snowfall to the city – November is
   Denver's second snowiest month, and Denver's greatest recorded snowfall
   from a single storm, 45.7 in (116 cm), fell in late autumn from
   December 1 to December 6, 1913.

Neighborhoods

   Enlarge
   Denver's 79 official neighborhoods shown on this map

   Denver has 79 neighborhoods that the city and community groups use for
   planning and administration. Although the city's delineation of the
   neighbourhood boundaries is somewhat arbitrary, it corresponds roughly
   to the definitions used by residents. These "neighborhoods" should not
   be confused with cities or suburbs, which are separate entities within
   the metro area.

   These neighborhoods' character vary significantly from each other and
   include everything from large skyscrapers to turn of the 20th century
   houses to modern, suburban style developments. Generally, the
   neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain
   more brick building material. Many neighborhoods away from the city
   center were developed after World War II, and are built with more
   modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even further from
   the city centre, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city
   have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist
   developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods.
   Most neighborhoods contain parks or other feature that is the focal
   point for the neighbourhood.

   Denver also has a number of neighborhoods not reflected in the
   administrative boundaries. Sometimes, these neighborhoods reflect the
   way people in an area identify themselves; sometimes, they reflect how
   others, such as real estate developers, have defined those areas.

   Well-known neighborhoods include the historic and trendy LoDo (short
   for "Lower Downtown"), part of the city's Union Station neighbourhood;
   Capitol Hill, Highland, Washington Park; Uptown, part of the North
   Capitol Hill neighbourhood; Curtis Park, part of the Five Points
   neighbourhood; Alamo Placita, the northern part of the Speer
   neighbourhood; and Golden Triangle, in the Civic Centre.

Parks and recreation

   When Denver was founded in 1858, the city was little more than a dusty
   collection of buildings on a long, grassy plain with a few contorted
   cottonwood and willow trees on riverbanks. As of 2006, Denver has over
   200 parks, from small mini-parks all over the city to the giant 314
   acre (1.3 km²) City Park to the 14,000 acre (57 km²) Denver Mountain
   Parks. Denver also has 28 recreation centers providing places and
   programming for resident's recreation and relaxation.

   Many of Denver's parks were acquired from state lands in the late 19th
   and early 20th centuries. This coincided with the City Beautiful
   movement, and legendary Denver mayor Robert Speer (1904-12 and 1916-18)
   set out to expand and beautify the city's parks. Reinhard Schuetze was
   the city's first landscape architect, and he brought his
   German-educated landscaping genius to Washington Park, Cheesman Park,
   and City Park among others. Speer used Schuetze as well as other
   landscape architects such as Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and Saco Rienk
   DeBoer to design not only parks such as Civic Centre Park, but many
   city parkways and tree-lawns. All of this greenery was fed with South
   Platte River water diverted through the city ditch.

   Mountains west of town.

   Mountains west of town.

   In addition to the parks within Denver itself, the city acquired land
   for mountain parks starting in the 1910s. Over the years, Denver has
   acquired, built and maintained around 40,000 acres (160 km²) of
   mountain parks, the most famous being Red Rocks Park, which is known
   just as much for its scenery as its musical history revolving around
   the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Denver also owns the Winter Park Resort ski
   area in Grand County, 60 miles west of Denver. City parks are important
   places for the both Denverites and visitors inciting controversy with
   every change. Denver continues to grow its park system with the
   development of many new parks along the Platte River through the city
   and in the Stapleton neighbourhood redevelopment. All of these parks
   are important gathering places for residents and allow what was once a
   dry plain to be lush, active, and green.

Government

   Enlarge
   Denver's iconic City and County Building (seen here around 1941), is
   the centre of political power for the city.

   Denver is a consolidated city and county with a non-partisan elected
   mayor (though s/he may belong to a particular political party), a
   13-member city council and an auditor. The Denver City Council is
   elected from 11 districts with two at-large council-members and is
   responsible for passing and changing all laws, resolutions, and
   ordinances, usually after a public hearing. They can also call for
   misconduct investigations of Denver's departmental officials.

   Denver has a strong mayor/weak city council government. The mayor can
   approve or veto any ordinances or resolutions approved by the council,
   makes sure all contracts with the city are kept and performed, signs
   all bonds and contracts, is responsible for the city budget, and can
   appoint people to various city departments, organizations, and
   commissions. However, the council can override the mayor's veto with a
   nine out of 13 member vote, and the city budget must be approved and
   can be changed by a simple majority vote of the council. The auditor
   checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually
   based on financial reasons.

   All elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of two
   terms. While Denver elections are non-partisan, Democrats have long
   held a virtual monopoly on Denver politics with all elected officials
   having Democratic Party affiliation. In federal elections, Denverites
   also tend to vote for Democratic candidates, voting for the Democratic
   Presidential nominee in every election since 1960 (excluding 1980 and
   1972). The office of Denver's Mayor has been occupied by a Democrat
   since the municipal general election of 1963, including the current
   mayor, John Hickenlooper. Denver is represented at the federal level by
   congresswoman Diana DeGette, a Democrat representing Colorado's 1st
   congressional district, which includes all of Denver and parts of
   Arapahoe County.

   During the 1960s and 1970s, Denver was one of the epicenters of the
   Chicano Movement. The boxer-turned-activist Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales
   formed an organization called the Crusade for Justice, which battled
   police brutality, fought for bilingual education, and, most notably,
   hosted the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference in March
   of 1969.

   In recent years, Denver has taken a stance on helping people who are or
   become homeless, particularly under the administrations of mayors John
   Hickenlooper and Wellington Webb. Denver's homeless population is
   considerably lower than many other major cities, but residents of the
   city streets have suffered during Denver's winters. Although mild and
   dry much of the time, Denver's winters can have brief periods of cold
   temperatures and varying amounts of snow. As a result, the city has set
   a national precedent on homeless services, with the creations of a
   ten-year plan to end homelessness (a plan now becoming popular in other
   cities as well), a task force and commission to end homelessness, and
   an expansion of human and civil services through the Denver area.

   In 2005, Denver became the first major city in the U.S. to make the
   private use of less than an ounce of marijuana legal for adults 21 and
   older. The city voted 53.49%-46.51% in favour of the marijuana
   legalization measure. It should be noted that this initiative does not
   usurp state law, which currently treats marijuana possession in much
   the same way as a speeding ticket, with fines of up to $100 and no jail
   time. The electorate of Colorado voted on and rejected a similar
   state-wide initiative in November 2006.

   Denver is competing with New York to host the 2008 Democratic National
   Convention, which would coincidentally be the centennial of the city's
   first hosting of the landmark 1908 convention. It also hosted the G7
   (now G8) summit between June 20 and June 22 in 1997.

   Denver's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its
   connection to some of the major transportation systems of the country.
   Because Denver is the largest city within 600 miles, it has become a
   natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to
   the Mountain States. Denver is also approximately halfway between the
   large cities of the Midwest like Chicago and Detroit and the cities of
   the West Coast, another benefit for distribution. Over the years, the
   city has been home to some large corporations in the central United
   States, making Denver a key trade point for the country.

   Geography also allows Denver to have a considerable government
   presence, with many federal agencies based or having offices in the
   Denver area. In fact, the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area has more
   federal workers than any other metropolitan area except for the
   Washington D.C. metropolitan area. Along with the plethora of federal
   agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects.
   Lockheed-Martin and Ball Aerospace are examples. Being the capital of
   the state of Colorado also gives many state jobs to Denver.

   In 2005, an expansion for the Colorado Convention Centre was completed.
   According to local officials, the convention centre expansion makes the
   city one of the top 10 cities in the nation for holding a convention.

   Denver's position near the mineral-rich Rocky Mountains, encouraged
   mining and energy companies to spring up in the area. In the early days
   of the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the
   economic success of the city. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy
   crisis in America created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap
   opera Dynasty. During this time, Denver was built up considerably, with
   many new downtown skyscrapers built during this time. Eventually, the
   oil prices dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986,
   and the Denver economy dropped with it, leaving almost 15,000 oil
   industry workers in the area unemployed (including current mayor John
   Hickenlooper, a former geologist), and the highest office vacancy rate
   in the nation (30%). Energy and mining are still important in Denver's
   economy today, with companies such as EnCana, Halliburton, Newmont
   Mining, Nobel Energy, and Anadarko.

   communication with both North American coasts, South America, Europe,
   and Asia in the same business day. Denver's location on the 105th
   meridian at over 1 mile in elevation also enables it to be the largest
   city in the U.S. to offer a 'one-bounce' real-time satellite uplink to
   six continents in the same business day. Qwest Communications,
   EchoStar, Starz-Encore, and Comcast are just a few of the
   telecommunications companies with operations in the Denver area. These
   and other high-tech companies had a boom in Denver in the mid to late
   1990s, but the technology bust in the new millennium caused Denver to
   lose many of those technology jobs. Recently, the Denver area has
   started making a comeback, with the October 2005 unemployment at 4.7%
   the lowest since September of 2001. Denver government and industry
   leaders are attempting to diversify the Denver economy so that it is
   less susceptible to boom and bust cycles.

Grid system

   Most of Denver has a straightforward street grid oriented to the four
   cardinal directions. Blocks are usually identified in hundreds from the
   median streets, identified as "0", which are Broadway (the west-east
   median) and Ellsworth Avenue (the north-south median). Colfax Avenue,
   the major east-west artery through Denver, is 15 blocks (1500) north of
   the median. Avenues north of Ellsworth are numbered (with the exception
   of Colfax Avenue and a few others), while avenues south of Ellsworth
   are named.

   There is also an older downtown grid system that was designed to be
   parallel to the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek.
   Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast-southwest and
   northwest-southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow
   removal; if the streets were in a normal N-S/E-W grid, only the N-S
   streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal
   directions, the NW-SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the
   morning and the NE-SW streets receive it in the afternoon. The NW-SE
   streets are numbered, while the NE-SW streets are named. The named
   streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with
   the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath
   the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered
   streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid
   system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and
   Speer Boulevard.

   All roads in the downtown grid system are streets. ( 16th Street, Stout
   Street) Roads outside of that system that travel east/west are given
   the suffix "avenue" and those that head north and south are given the
   "street" suffix. (Example, Colfax Avenue, Lincoln Street,). Boulevards
   are higher capacity streets and will travel any direction. Smaller
   roads are sometimes referred to as places, drives or courts. Most
   streets outside of the area between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard are
   organized alphabetically from the city's centre.

   Confusion may arise where the two grid systems meet, especially given
   downtown Denver's one way streets. The system can be easily navigated
   with the help of directional signs. The mountains to the west also
   offer a great compass-point for those attempting to drive in the Mile
   High City.

Highways

   Denver is primarily served by the interstate highways I-25 and I-70.
   The intersection of the two interstates is referred to locally as " the
   mousetrap", because when airborne, the junction (and subsequent
   vehicles) resemble mice in a large trap. I-70 runs east-west from Utah
   to Maryland. I-25 runs north-south from New Mexico through Denver to
   Wyoming. I-225 traverses neighboring Aurora and connects with I-25 in
   the southeastern corner of Denver. Additionally, I-76 begins from I-70
   just west of the city in Arvada. It intersects I-25 north of the city
   and runs northeast to Nebraska where it ends at I-80. U.S. Route 6
   connects downtown Denver to the suburb of Golden.

   A highway expansion and transit project for the southern I-25 corridor,
   dubbed T-REX (TRansportation EXpansion), was completed on November
   17th, 2006. The project installed wider and additional highway lanes,
   and improved highway access and drainage. The project also includes a
   light rail line that traverses from downtown to the south end of the
   metro area, known as "Surrey Ridge". The project spanned almost 19
   miles along the highway with an additional line traveling parallel to
   part of I-225

Mass transportation

   Mass transportation throughout the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area is
   managed and coordinated by the Regional Transportation District (RTD).
   RTD currently operates more than 1,000 buses serving 10,000 bus stops
   in 38 municipal jurisdictions. Additionally, RTD operates two light
   rail lines (the C Line and the D Line) with a total of 15.8 miles of
   track and serving 24 stations. Current RTD local fare is $1.50 with
   disabled residents who have an RTD disabled discount card being charged
   75¢. FasTracks, an expansion project approved by voters in 2004, will
   allow light rail to serve cities such as Lakewood, Golden, and Aurora.
   Commuter rail lines will serve the northern section of the metropolitan
   area, in addition to Boulder, Longmont, and Denver International
   Airport. November 17, 2006 the first extension of Light Rail in four
   years, and some elements of the new lines will mark the beginning of
   the FasTracks program (although this extension of the system was part
   of T-Rex). The E and F Lines travel from downtown Denver to Lincoln
   Avenue, at the southern end of the Metro area. The H Line travels from
   downtown Denver to the Nine Mile station, on I-225 in Aurora. The G
   line, the shortest line in the extension, travels from Lincoln Avenue
   to the Nine Mile station.

   Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Denver,
   operating its California Zephyr daily in both directions between
   Chicago and Emeryville, California, across the bay from San Francisco.
   Amtrak Thruway service operated by private bus companies links the
   Denver station with Rocky Mountain points. At Raton, New Mexico, Denver
   Thruway connections are made daily with the Amtrak Southwest Chief.
   Additionally, there is the Ski Train operated by the Denver & Rio
   Grande Western Railroad, which takes passengers between Denver and the
   Winter Park Ski Resort. Denver's early years as a major train hub of
   the west are still very visible today. Trains stop in Denver at
   historic Union Station, where travelers can access RTD's 16th Street
   Free MallRide or use light rail to tour the city. Union Station will
   also serve as the main juncture for rail travel in the metro area, at
   the completion of FasTracks.

   Denver International Airport (IATA: DEN, ICAO: KDEN), commonly known as
   DIA, serves as the primary airport for the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan
   area. It is the eleventh busiest airport in the world and ranks sixth
   in the United States, with 43.4 million passengers passing through it
   in 2005. It covers more than 53 square miles (137 km²), making it the
   largest airport in the United States by land area. Denver serves as a
   major hub for United Airlines and the headquarters for Frontier
   Airlines. In the past, Denver has been home to other airports that are
   no longer operational. Stapleton International Airport was closed in
   1995 when it was replaced by DIA. Lowry Air Force Base was a military
   flight training facility that ceased flight operations in 1966, with
   the base finally being closed in 1994.

   Denver's many colleges and universities range in age and study
   programs. The city boasts Roman Catholic and Jewish institutions, as
   well as a well-respected health sciences school. In addition to those
   schools within the city, there are a number of schools located
   throughout the surrounding metro area.
     * University of Denver
     * Metropolitan State College of Denver
     * University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Centre
     * Johnson & Wales University
     * Regis University
     * Community College of Denver
     * Heritage College
     * National American University
     * Yeshiva Toras Chaim Talmudical Seminary

Primary and secondary schools

   Denver Public Schools (DPS) is the public school system in Denver. It
   currently educates about 73,000 students in 73 elementary schools, 15
   K-8 schools, 17 middle schools, 14 high schools, and 19 charter schools
   . The first school of what is now DPS was a log cabin that opened in
   1859 on the corner of 12th Street between Market and Larimer Streets.
   This district only serves the City and County of Denver; the suburban
   districts are generally divided by county or by city.

Culture and contemporary life

   Denver hosts a great and rich history of culture. Apollo Hall opened
   quickly after the city's founding in 1859 and staged many plays for
   eager settlers. In the 1880's Horace Tabor built Denver's first Opera
   House. After the turn of the century, city leaders embarked on a city
   beautification program that created many of the city's parks, parkways,
   museums, and the Municipal Auditorium, which was home to the 1908
   Democratic Convention and is now known as the Ellie Caulkins Opera
   House. Denver and the metropolitan areas around it continued to support
   culture. In 1988, voters in the Denver-Aurora Metropolitan Area
   approved the Scientific and Cultural Facilities Tax (commonly known as
   SCFD), a .01 sales tax that contributes money to various cultural and
   scientific facilities and organizations throughout the Metro area. The
   tax has been renewed by voters every time it has come on the ballot

   Now, Denver is home to many nationally recognized museums, including a
   new wing for the Denver Art Museum by world-renowned architect Daniel
   Libeskind, the second largest Performing arts centre in the nation
   after Lincoln Centre in New York City and bustling neighborhoods such
   as LoDo, filled with art galleries, restaurants, bars and clubs. That
   is part of the reason why Denver was recently recognized for the third
   year in a row as the best city for singles. Denver continues to gain
   cultural importance. The city was selected as the future home for a
   museum dedicated to abstract expressionist painter Clyfford Still.
   Denver's neighborhoods also continue their influx of diverse people and
   businesses while the city's cultural institutions grow and prosper.

Music

   While Denver may not be as recognized for historical musical prominence
   like such cities as Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago, or New York, it
   still manages to have a very active pop, jazz, jam, folk, and classical
   music scene, which has nurtured several artists and genres to regional,
   national, and even international attention. Though nearby Boulder has
   its own very distinct music scene, artists based there also play in
   Denver.

   Of particular note, is Denver's importance in the folk scene of the
   1960s and 1970s. Well-known folk artists such as Bob Dylan, Judy
   Collins and John Denver lived in Denver at various points during this
   time, and performed at local clubs.

   Denver is widely recognized as being one of America's premier sports
   cities. In particular, the Denver Broncos of the NFL have been able to
   draw crowds of nearly 70,000 since their AFL origins in the early
   1960s. The team has advanced to the Super Bowl six times and won
   back-to-back in 1998 and '99. In the 1980s and 1990s, one of the top
   priorities of former Mayor Federico Peña was bringing major league
   baseball to the city, an effort which culminated in the construction of
   Coors Field and the creation of the Colorado Rockies as an expansion
   franchise in 1993. Denver is also home to the NHL team, the Colorado
   Avalanche, who have won two Stanley Cups (1996 and 2001) while in
   Denver, as well as the NBA team, the Denver Nuggets. The home arena of
   both the Avalanche and the Nuggets is the Pepsi Centre. The city also
   hosted the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer through 2006, with a
   new stadium being built in nearby Commerce City for 2007.
