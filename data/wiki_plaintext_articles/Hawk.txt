         Scientific classification

   Kingdom:   Animalia
   Phylum:    Chordata
   Class:     Aves
   Order:     Accipitriformes
   Family:    Accipitridae
   Subfamily: Accipitrinae

                                   Genera

     * Accipiter
     * Micronisus
     * Melierax
     * Urotriorchis
     * Erythrotriorchis

   The term hawk refers to birds of prey in any of three senses:
     * Strictly, to mean any of the species in the bird sub-family
       Accipitrinae in the genera Accipiter, Micronisus, Melierax,
       Urotriorchis, and Megatriorchis. The large and widespread Accipiter
       genus includes goshawks, sparrowhawks , the Sharp-shinned Hawk and
       others. They are mainly woodland birds that hunt by sudden dashes
       from a concealed perch. They usually have long tails and high
       visual acuity.

     * More generally, to mean small to medium-sized birds that are
       members of the Accipitridae, the family which includes the true
       hawks (Accipiters) and also eagles, kites, harriers, buzzards, and
       Old World vultures.

     * Loosely, to mean almost any bird of prey.

   The common names of birds in various parts of the world often use hawk
   loosely. For example, in North America, the Buteos are called "hawks".

   In February 2005 the Canadian scientist Dr Louis Lefebvre announced a
   method of measuring avian IQ in terms of their innovation in feeding
   habits. Hawks were named among the most intelligent birds based on this
   scale.

   Hawks are believed to have vision as good as 20/2, about eight times
   more acute than humans with good eyesight. This is because of many
   photoreceptors in the retina (Up to 1,000,000 per square mm, against
   200,000 for humans), a very high number of nerves connecting the
   receptors to the brain, a second set of eye muscles not found in other
   animals, and an indented fovea, which magnifies the central part of the
   visual field.

Hawks and humans

     * Hawks are sometimes used in falconry, a sport in which trained
       hawks, eagles or falcons, are used to pursue and catch small game.
     * In the US, hawks are sometimes shot for sport or by ranchers who
       believe the birds may depredate livestock. This makes hawk
       conservation an issue in some areas. In other parts of the world,
       most hawk species are protected by law
