   Hamburg's motto: May the posterity endeavour with dignity to conserve
   the freedom, which the forefathers acquired.

   Hamburg (German pronunciation: [ˈhambʊʁk]; Low Saxon: Hamborg,
   ['haˑmbɔːχ]) is the second largest city in Germany and with Hamburg
   Harbour, its principal port, Hamburg is also the second largest port
   city in Europe, no. 9 in the world-ranking of ports and the largest
   city of the Union which is not a capital. A large part of the port is a
   fenced-in duty-free area.

   The official name Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (German: Freie und
   Hansestadt Hamburg; Low Saxon: Free un Hansestadt Hamborg) refers to
   Hamburg's membership in the medieval Hanseatic League and the fact that
   Hamburg is a City State and one of the sixteen Federal States of
   Germany.

   Hamburg is situated on the southern tip of Jutland Peninsula,
   geographically centred (a) between Continental Europe and Scandinavia
   and (b) between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The city of Hamburg
   lies at the junction of the river Elbe with the rivers Alster and Bille
   and the city centre is beautifully set around two lakes, the
   Binnenalster ("Inner Alster") and the Aussenalster ("Outer Alster").

   Hamburg is an international trade city and the commercial and cultural
   centre of Northern Germany.

Politics and Administration

   The Bürgerschaft (City Assembly) is the parliament of the Free and
   Hanseatic City of Hamburg, which is elected by the citizens of Hamburg
   every four years.no it wasent dumbo

   The Erster Bürgermeister (First Mayor with first in the sense of primus
   inter pares, first among equals) is head of the senate (which forms the
   executive branch of government) and gets elected by the city assembly
   and is thus head of the city state. The current mayor is Ole von Beust
   (see also List of mayors of Hamburg). He is, after Klaus Wowereit in
   Berlin, the second openly homosexual mayor of a city in Germany.

   The state and administrative city cover 750 km² with 1.8 million
   inhabitants, while another 0.8 million live in neighboring urban areas.
   The Greater Hamburg Metropolitan Region (Metropolregion Hamburg)
   includes some districts in the adjacent federal states of
   Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony and covers an area of 18,100 km²
   with a population of just over 4 million.

   Hamburg is organised into seven districts (Bezirke) comprising 104
   suburbs (Stadtteile):
     * Altona
     * Bergedorf
     * Eimsbüttel
     * Harburg

   Three small islands in the North Sea also belong to the City State of
   Hamburg: Neuwerk, Scharhörn and Nigehörn.

History

   Hamburg 1800
   Enlarge
   Hamburg 1800

   The city takes its name from the first permanent building on the site,
   a castle ordered to be built by Emperor Charlemagne in 808 AD. The
   castle was built on some rocky ground in a marsh between the Alster and
   the Elbe as a defence against Slavic incursion. The castle was named
   Hammaburg, where "burg" means "castle".

   The "Hamma" element remains uncertain. Old High German includes both a
   hamma, "angle" and a hamme, "pastureland." The angle might refer to a
   spit of land or to the curvature of a river. However, the language
   spoken might not have been Old High German, as Low Saxon was spoken
   there later. Other theories are that the castle was named for a
   surrounding Hamma forest, or for the village of Hamm, later
   incorporated into the city. Hamm as a place name occurs a number of
   times in Germany, but its meaning is equally uncertain. It could be
   related to "heim" and Hamburg could have been placed in the territory
   of the ancient Chamavi. However, a derivation of "home city" is perhaps
   too direct, as the city was named after the castle. Another theory is
   that Hamburg comes from ham which is Old Saxon for shore.

   In 834 Hamburg was designated the seat of a bishopric, whose first
   bishop, Ansgar, became known as the Apostle of the North. In 845 a
   fleet of 600 Viking ships came up the River Elbe and destroyed Hamburg,
   at that time a town of around 500 inhabitants. Two years later, Hamburg
   was united with Bremen as the bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen.

   In 1030, the city was burned down by King Mieszko II Lambert of Poland.
   After further raids in 1066 and 1072 the bishop permanently moved to
   Bremen. Hamburg had several great fires, notably in 1284 and 1842.

   The charter in 1189 by Frederick I "Barbarossa" granted Hamburg the
   status of an Imperial Free City and tax free access up the Lower Elbe
   into the North Sea. This and Hamburg's proximity to the main trade
   routes of the North Sea and Baltic Sea quickly made it a major port in
   Northern Europe. Its trade alliance with Lübeck in 1241 marks the
   origin and core of the powerful Hanseatic League of trading cities.

   In 1529 the city embraced Lutheranism, and Hamburg subsequently
   received Protestant refugees from the Netherlands and France. Hamburg
   was at times under Danish sovereignty while remaining part of the Holy
   Roman Empire as an Imperial Free City.

   Briefly annexed by Napoleon I (1810-14), Hamburg suffered severely
   during his last campaign in Germany. The city was besieged for over a
   year by Allied forces (mostly Russian, Swedish and German). Russian
   forces under General Bennigsen finally freed the city in 1814. During
   the first half of the 19th century a patron goddess with Hamburg's
   Latin name Hammonia emerged, mostly in romantic and poetic references,
   and although she has no mythology to call her own, Hammonia became the
   symbol of the city's spirit during this time.

   Hamburg experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the
   19th century, when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as
   the growth of the city's Atlantic trade helped make it Europe's
   third-largest port.

   With Albert Ballin as its director the Hamburg-America Line became the
   world's largest transatlantic shipping company at the turn of the
   century, and Hamburg was also home to shipping companies to South
   America, Africa, India and East Asia. Hamburg became a cosmopolitan
   metropolis based on worldwide trade. Hamburg was the port for most
   Germans and Eastern Europeans to leave for the New World and became
   home to trading communities from all over the world (like a small
   Chinatown in Altona, Hamburg).

   After World War I Germany lost her colonies and Hamburg lost many of
   its trade routes. In 1938 the city boundaries were extended with the
   Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz ( Greater Hamburg Act) to incorporate Wandsbek,
   Harburg, Wilhelmsburg and Altona. The city counts 1.7 million
   inhabitants.

   During World War II Hamburg suffered a series of devastating air raids
   which killed 42,000 German civilians ( Bombing of Hamburg in World War
   II). Through this, and the new zoning guidelines of the 1960s, the
   inner city lost much of its architectural past.

   The Iron Curtain—only 50 kilometres east of Hamburg—separated the city
   from most of its hinterland and further reduced Hamburg's global trade.
   On February 16, 1962 a severe storm caused the Elbe to rise to an
   all-time high, inundating one fifth of Hamburg and killing more than
   300 people.

   After German reunification in 1990, and the accession of some Eastern
   European and Baltic States into the EU in 2004, Hamburg Harbour and
   Hamburg have ambitions for regaining their positions as the region's
   largest deep-sea port for container shipping and its major commercial
   and trading centre. Hamburg 2020

Economy

   The most significant economic basis for Hamburg in the past centuries
   has been (and still is) its harbour (see: Hamburg Harbour), which ranks
   2^nd in Europe and 9^th worldwide with transshipments of 9 million
   standard container units ( TEU) and 115 million tons of goods in 2004.
   International trade is also the reason for the large number of
   consulates in the city. Although situated several kilometres up the
   Elbe, due to its ability to handle sea ships it is considered a sea
   harbour.

   Hamburg follows third after Seattle and Toulouse in the list of the
   most important locations of the civil aerospace industry worldwide.
   Airbus, which has one of its two assembly plants in Hamburg, and
   related companies employ over 30,000 people in or near the city.

   Other important industries are media businesses, most notably three of
   Germany's largest publishing companies, Axel Springer Verlag , Gruner +
   Jahr and Heinrich Bauer Verlag . About half of Germany's national
   newspapers and magazines are produced in Hamburg. There are also a
   number of music companies (the largest being Warner Music Germany) and
   Internet businesses (e.g. AOL, Adobe Systems and Google Germany).

   Heavy industry includes the making of steel, aluminium and Europe's
   largest copper plant , and a number of shipyards like Blohm + Voss .

Transport

   Hamburg is connected by four Autobahnen (motorways) and is the most
   important railway junction on the route to Northern Europe. Hamburg's
   international airport is Hamburg Airport, which is the oldest airport
   in Germany still in operation. There is also the smaller Hamburg
   Finkenwerder Airport.

   Though large cities in Germany normally only have a one-letter prefix
   (e.g. B for Berlin), Hamburg's vehicle licence plate prefix is "HH"
   (Hansestadt Hamburg, English: Hanseatic City of Hamburg), which
   underlines Hamburg's historic roots and allows the city of Hanover to
   use the prefix "H".

   As in most larger German cities, public transport is organised by a
   fare-collection joint venture between transportation companies. Tickets
   sold by one member company in this Hamburger Verkehrsverbund (HVV) are
   valid on all other HVV companies' services.

   Nine mass transit routes across the city are the backbone of Hamburg
   public transport. Three lines comprise the U-Bahn and six the S-Bahn
   system. U-Bahn, short for Untergrundbahn (underground, subway), is a
   standard German term for a municipally owned, electric mass transit
   system. Approximately 41km of 101 km of the U-Bahn lies underground;
   most of the U-Bahn tracks are on embankments or viaducts or at ground
   level. Older residents still speak of the system as the Hochbahn
   ("elevated railway"). The Hamburg S-Bahn has a total length of 115.2km
   (8km single-track, 10km underground) with 59 stations, of which 10 are
   underground. A light rail system, the AKN, connects to satellite towns
   in Schleswig-Holstein. Gaps in the mass-transit network are filled by
   bus routes, plied by single-deck, two-, three- and four-axle diesel
   buses. Hamburg has no trams or trolley-buses, but has hydrogen fuelled
   buses operating pilot services.

   Finally, regional trains of Germany's major railway company Deutsche
   Bahn AG and the regional Metronom trains may be used with a HVV public
   transport ticket, too. Except at the three bigger stations in the
   centre of Hamburg, the regional trains hardly stop again inside the
   area of the city.

   A 24-hour bus network operates as frequently as every 2 minutes on busy
   routes (30 minutes in suburban areas). There are six ferry lines along
   the river Elbe, operated by the HADAG company. While mainly needed by
   Hamburg citizens and dock workers, they can also be used for
   sightseeing tours at the (relatively) low fees of a HVV public
   transport ticket.

   Contemporary: Hamburg is known for giving the Beatles a start in their
   musical career in the early 1960s. They played at the Star-Club, which
   was located in the district St. Pauli near the perhaps most famous
   street of Hamburg, the Reeperbahn.

   Sascha Konietzko the frontman and founder of KMFDM is from Hamburg and
   visits reguarly.

   More recently it is known for some of the most popular German hip hop
   acts, such as 5 Sterne Deluxe, Samy Deluxe, Beginner, Fettes Brot, Ian
   o Brien, Anette Louisan and wir sind Helden. There is also a quite big
   alternative and punk scene which gathers around the Rote Flora, an
   occupied former theatre located in the district of Sternschanze. Some
   of the musicians of the famous electronic band Kraftwerk also came from
   Hamburg.

   Hamburg is also famous for an original kind of German alternative music
   called Hamburger Schule ("Hamburg School"), a term used for bands like
   Die Sterne, Tocotronic, Blumfeld and Tomte.

   Hamburg was one of the major centres of the heavy metal music world in
   the 1980's. Many bands such as Helloween, Running Wild and Grave Digger
   got their start in Hamburg. The influences of these bands and other
   bands from the area were critical to establishing the subgenre of Power
   metal.

   Hamburg is also one of the most important global centres for
   psychedelic trance music. It is home to many record labels such as
   Spirit Zone, Mushroom Magazine, the world's best known and longest
   running psy-trance magazine, as well as many parties, club nights.
   During the summer people from all over the world flock to the
   countryside surrounding Hamburg to attend massive festivals such as
   Voov Experience, Shiva Moon, Tshitraka and Fusion Festival.

   Since the German premiere of Cats in 1985 there are always a number of
   musicals being played in the city. Among them have been Phantom of the
   Opera, The Lion King or Dirty Dancing ( before there was Dance of the
   Vampires). This density, which is the highest in Germany, is partly due
   to Germany's major musical production company Stage Entertainment being
   located in Hamburg. One of the musical theatres is a large tent in the
   harbour, guests either arrive by boat or through the historic Old Elbe
   Tunnel.

Cuisine

   Although Hamburg is jokingly said to be the birthplace of the
   Hamburger, this might just be a myth. But the beef patties, a German
   immigrant from Hamburg sold in the 1850s in New York allegedly were
   named after that Hamburgian butcher and then became a generic term, so
   the myth goes.

   Original Hamburg dishes are Bohnen, Birnen und Speck ( Low Saxon Bohn,
   Peern un Speck, green runner beans cooked with pears and bacon),
   Aalsuppe ( Low Saxon Oolsupp, often mistaken to be German for "eel
   soup" (Aal/Ool ‘eel’), however the name probably comes from the Low
   Saxon allns [ʔaˑlns], meaning “all”, “everything and the kitchen sink”,
   not necessarily eel. Today eel is often included to meet the
   expectations of unsuspecting diners.), Bratkartoffeln ( Low Saxon
   Brootkartüffeln, pan-fried potato slices), Finkenwerder Scholle ( Low
   Saxon Finkwarder Scholl, pan-fried plaice), Pannfisch (pan-fried fish),
   Rote Grütze ( Low Saxon Rode Grütt, related to Danish rødgrød, a type
   of summer pudding made mostly from berries and usually served with
   cream, like Danish rødgrød med fløde) and Labskaus (a mixture of corned
   beef, mashed potatoes and beet root, a cousin of the Norwegian lapskaus
   and Liverpool's lobscouse, all offshoots off an old-time one-pot meal
   that used to be the main component of the common sailor’s humdrum diet
   on the high seas).

   Hamburg is the birthplace of Alsterwasser (a reference to the city’s
   river Alster with two lake-like bodies in the city centre thanks to
   damming), a type of shandy, a concoction of equal parts of beer and
   carbonated lemonade (Zitronenlimonade), the lemonade being added to the
   beer. Hamburg is also home to a curious regional pastry called
   Franzbrötchen. Looking rather like a flattened croissant, the
   Franzbrötchen is somewhat similar in preparation but includes a
   cinnamon and sugar filling, often with raisins or brown sugar
   streussel. The name may also reflect to the roll's croissant-like
   appearance -- franz appears to be a shortening of französisch, meaning
   "French," which would make a Franzbrötchen a “french roll.” Being a
   Hamburg regional food, the Franzbrötchen becomes quite scarce outside
   the borders of the city; as near as Lunenburg ( Lüneburg) it can only
   be found as a Hamburger and is not to be had in Bremen at all.

   Ordinary bread rolls—without which a leisurely weekend breakfast in
   Hamburg is unimaginable—tend to be oval-shaped and of the French bread
   variety. The local name is Rundstück (“round piece” rather than
   mainstream German Brötchen, diminutive form of Brot “bread”), a
   relative of Denmark’s rundstykke. In fact, while by no means identical,
   the cuisines of Hamburg and Denmark, especially of Copenhagen have a
   lot in common. This also includes a predilection for open-faced
   sandwiches of all sorts, especially topped with cold-smoked or pickled
   fish. The American hamburger seems to have developed from Hamburg’s
   Frikadelle (or Frikandelle): a pan-fried patty (usually larger and
   thicker than the American counterpart) made from a mixture of ground
   beef, soaked stale bread, egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper, usually
   served with potatoes and vegetables like any other piece of meat, not
   usually on a bun. (Many Hamburgers consider their Frikadelle and the
   American hamburger different, virtually unrelated “creatures.”)

Sports

   The most popular sports team in Hamburg is Hamburger SV (which
   currently plays in the Champions League), a football team in the 1^st
   division of the German football league. They play at the AOL Arena, as
   do the Hamburg Sea Devils, an American football team of NFL Europe. The
   Hamburg Blue Devils are another American football team in Hamburg,
   playing in the domestic league. The Hamburg Freezers represent Hamburg
   in the DEL, the highest ice hockey league in Germany. The HSV Handball
   represents Hamburg in the German handball league. Both teams play in
   the ultra-modern Colour Line Arena. Additionally FC St. Pauli is a
   highly regarded third division (formlerly 1^st division) football club
   with a large fan base. They play at the Millerntor-Stadion. Hamburg is
   the nation's hockey capital and dominates the men's as well as the
   women's hockey leagues with teams like Der Club an der Alster,
   Grossflottbeker THGC, Harvestehuder THC, Klipper THC or Uhlenhorster
   HC.

Demographics

Language

   As elsewhere in Northern Germany, the original language of Hamburg is
   Low Saxon, usually referred to as Hamborger Platt (German Hamburger
   Platt) or Hamborgsch. It is still in use, albeit by a minority and
   rarely in public, probably due to a hostile climate between World War
   II and the early 1980s. Since large-scale Germanisation beginning in
   earnest with in the 18th century, various Low German-coloured dialects
   have developed (contact-varieties of German on Low Saxon substrates).
   Originally, there was a range of such Missingsch varieties, best known
   being the low-prestige ones of the working classes and the somewhat
   more “posh” bourgeois Hanseatendeutsch. All of these are now moribund
   due to the influences of “proper” German propagated by education and
   media, perhaps also because of gradual erosion of the erstwhile
   independent spirit and local pride of Hamburg’s population.

   In addition, immigration brought numerous dialects from all over the
   German-speaking world used to Hamburg, also a large number of foreign
   language communities, such as Turkish, Kurdish, Italian, Arabic,
   Berber, Persian, Spanish, Portuguese, Serbo-Croatian, Polish, Russian,
   English, Scandinavian, Finnish, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino
   and numerous sub-Saharan African languages. Furthermore, Hamburg has a
   sizeable population of Sinti and Roma (“Gypsy”) people, some of them
   sedentary (mostly Sinti) and some of them nomadic or semi-nomadic
   (mostly Roma), camp grounds being set aside by the state and municipal
   governments. Hamburg is thus one of the few locations in the world in
   which both Sinti and Romany are spoken, and it is also one of the major
   headquarters of international Roma organisations.

Tourism

   Hamburg was generally not considered to be a tourist magnet, not even
   by locals. Nevertheless, tourism plays a significant role in the city's
   economy, and according to the magazine Travelhouse Media even two of
   the most visited sites in Germany are located here: the harbour (8
   million visitors per year) and the Reeperbahn (4 million), compared to
   famous sites like the Cathedral in Cologne (6 million) or the castle
   Neuschwanstein (200,000) unexpected high numbers to most people.
   Hamburg has the fastest growing tourism industry in Germany (2005 and
   2006 approx. 15%) and will most probably reach rank 10 of Europe's most
   visited tourist destinations by 2008.

   Hamburg is best visited in spring or summer. A typical Hamburg visit
   includes a tour of the city hall and the grand church St. Michaelis
   (called the Michel), and visiting the old warehouse district
   (Speicherstadt) and the harbour promenade (Landungsbrücken).
   Sightseeing buses connect these points of interest. Of course, a visit
   in one of the world's largest harbours would be incomplete without
   having taken one of the harbour and/or canal boat tours (Große
   Hafenrundfahrt, Fleetfahrt) which start from the Landungsbrücken. Many
   visitors take a walk in the evening around the area of Reeperbahn,
   considered Europe's second largest red light district and home of many
   theatres, bars and night clubs. It was in the Reeperbahn that The
   Beatles began their career with a three month residency in 1960. Others
   prefer the laidback Schanze district with its street cafés or a
   barbecue on one of the beaches along the river Elbe. And not to forget:
   Hamburg's famous Hagenbeck's Tierpark (Zoo) with the great artificial
   rocka and the first moated, barless enclosures ever to be built (1907).
   A friend of Hagenbeck's, the illustrator Heinrich Leutemann made some
   illustrations here.

   Quite common is a tour through Northern Germany with Hamburg as a
   starting point or stop-over.

   However, most people visit Hamburg because of a specific interest,
   notably one of the musicals, a sports event, a congress or fair.
   Therefore, in 2005, the average visitor spent two nights in Hamburg.
   The majority of visitors come from Germany (80%); most foreigners are
   European, especially from the United Kingdom and Switzerland, and the
   largest group from outside Europe comes from the U.S. An interesting
   footnote is the high number of rich guests from the Arabian peninsula,
   who seek treatment in one of Hamburg's hospitals.
