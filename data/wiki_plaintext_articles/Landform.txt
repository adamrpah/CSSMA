Landform

2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. Related subjects: Geology and geophysics

   A landform comprises a geomorphological unit. They are largely defined
   by their surface form and location in the landscape, as part of the
   terrain, and as such, they are also studied as elements of topography.

   Landforms are categorised by characteristics such as elevation, slope,
   orientation, stratification, rock exposure, and soil type. Landforms by
   name include berms, mounds, hills, cliffs, valleys, and so forth.
   Oceans and continents exemplify highest-order landforms. Landform
   elements are parts of a landform that can be further identified.
   Landform elements, such as hill-top, shoulder, backslope etc, can be
   observed on many various geomorphological landforms. The generic
   landform elements are: pits, peaks, channels, ridges, passes, pools,
   planes etc, and can be often extracted from a digital elevation model
   using some automated or semi-automated techniques.

   Elementary landforms (segments, facets, relief units) are the smallest
   homogeneous divisions of the land surface, at the given
   scale/resolution. These are areas with relatively homogenuous
   morphometric properties, bounded by lines of discontinuity. A plateau
   or a hill can be observed at various scales ranging from few hundred
   meters to hundreds of kilometers. Hence, the spatial distribution of
   landforms is often fuzzy and scale-dependent as is the case for soils
   and geological strata.

   A number of factors, ranging from plate tectonics to erosion and
   deposition can generate and affect landforms. Biological factors can
   also influence landforms—see for example the role of plants in the
   development of dune systems and salt marshes, and the work of corals
   and algae in the formation of coral reefs.

   Many of the terms are not restricted to refer to features of the planet
   Earth, and can be used to describe surface features of other planets
   and similar objects in the Universe.

Erosion landforms

   Landforms produced by erosion and weathering usually occur in coastal
   or fluvial environments, and many appear above under those headings.
   Some other erosion landforms that do not fall into the above categories
   include:
     * canyon
     * cave
     * lavaka
     * limestone pavement
     * rock formations
     * tea table

     * Deposition landform -- landforms produced by deposition of load or
       sediment (usually coastal or fluvial).
     * Eolian landform - landforms produced by wind weathering.
