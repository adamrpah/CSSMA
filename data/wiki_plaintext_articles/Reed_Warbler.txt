   Acrocephalus scirpaceus
   ( Hermann, 1804)

   The Eurasian Reed Warbler, or just Reed Warbler, Acrocephalus
   scirpaceus, is an Old World warbler in the genus Acrocephalus. It
   breeds across Europe into temperate western Asia. It is migratory,
   wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.

   This small passerine bird is a species found almost exclusively in
   reedbeds, usually with some bushes. The 3-5 eggs are laid in a basket
   nest in reeds. The chicks fledge after 10 or 11 days.

   Reed warblers are one of the species that are brood paracitised by the
   common cuckoo.

   This is a medium-sized warbler, 12.5-14cm in length. The adult has an
   unstreaked brown back and buff underparts. The forehead is flattened,
   and the bill is strong and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with
   most warblers, but young birds are richer buff below. Like most
   warblers, it is insectivorous, but will take other small food items
   including berries.

   The song is a slow, chattering jit-jit-jit with typically acrocephaline
   whistles and mimicry added.
