   Tropical Storm Delta was a late-forming tropical storm of the 2005
   Atlantic hurricane season which struck the Canary Islands as a strong
   extratropical storm causing significant damage and then crossed over
   Morocco with little impact there. It was the twenty-sixth tropical or
   subtropical storm of the season.

   Tropical Storm Delta, like most late-season storms, developed out of an
   extratropical low. The storm only gradually gained tropical
   characteristics and was briefly a subtropical storm on November 22.
   Delta moved erratically for a few days before moving towards the Canary
   Islands. It became extratropical just before it passed to the north of
   the archipelago.

Storm history

   On November 22, a non-tropical area of low pressure in the central
   Atlantic Ocean began to gain some tropical characteristics. Late that
   afternoon the low became Subtropical Storm Delta, while located over
   800 miles (1300 km) west-southwest of the Azores. Operationally the
   National Hurricane Centre considered that the storm had already gained
   enough tropical characteristics to be classified as a tropical storm,
   but in post-storm analysis this was reconsidered.

   The storm's convection became more organized and Delta became a
   tropical storm on November 24. It strengthened further to its peak
   strength of 70 mph (110 km/h) later that day, just below hurricane
   strength. The official forecast at this time predicted that Delta would
   strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane, but this did not
   occur. Delta maintained this strength for a few days as it moved slowly
   and erratically in the central Atlantic. As shear increased over the
   storm, a weakening trend began on November 25 and by the end of the
   next day Delta had weakened into a minimal tropical storm. Some of the
   computer models showed that the weakening tropical storm could be
   absorbed by a developing low to the west, which a few days later became
   Hurricane Epsilon. This did not occur, and Tropical Storm Delta began
   to move to the northeast.

   As Delta accelerated to the northeast towards the Canary Islands, it
   intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane
   strength on November 27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted that
   there was a possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane
   strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to
   justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November 28, as it neared
   the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical
   characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of
   near-hurricane strength, passed about 105 miles (165 km) north of the
   islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November 29
   and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over
   northwestern Algeria.

Impact

   Storm damage from Delta on Tenerife

   Considerable damage was reported in the Canary Islands as a result of
   Delta, where it was described as a "historic" event, as hurricanes are
   extremely rare there. The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest
   hit, with many uprooted trees and landslides reported there. The peak
   gust recorded at La Palma was 152 km/h (95 mph), and at Tenerife the
   maximum gust was 147 km/h (90 mph). One hospital had to be evacuated
   and several airports were closed across the islands. In all, over
   225,000 customers lost electricity and many lost telephone service.

   In addition, a famous natural tourist attraction, El Dedo de Dios (or
   God's finger), a geological feature which had been pointing towards the
   sky for over a millennium and an important landmark for the Canary
   Islands, was destroyed by Delta's winds and wave action along Gran
   Canaria's shore. Delta claimed seven lives; six of them were immigrants
   that were on a boat that sank off the Canary Islands and 12 were
   reported missing. The seventh was a result of winds throwing a man off
   a house while it was being repaired during the storm.

   The total damage caused by Tropical Storm Delta throughout the Canaries
   was estimated to be over â‚¬312 million ($364 million 2005 US dollars).
   Delta was also blamed for a 10-15% reduction of the islands tuna catch,
   as it kept the fishermen in port for several days.

   Delta was described as a "normal atmospheric disturbance" in Morocco
   and no damage was reported there. In fact, it was welcomed as farmers
   needed the rain there to complete the sowing of cereal crops.

Records

   When Subtropical Storm Delta formed on November 22, it was the first
   time that twenty-six tropical or subtropical storms had formed in the
   Atlantic during one hurricane season.
