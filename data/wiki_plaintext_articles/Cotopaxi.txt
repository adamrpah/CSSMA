   Cotopaxi is a volcano located about 50 km south of Quito, Ecuador. At
   5,897 m it is the second highest in the country—the highest being the
   Chimborazo. Cotopaxi is technically referred to as a stratovolcano. It
   has a height ( topographic prominence) of more than 3,000 m when
   measured from its base, which has a width about 23 km. It has one of
   the only equatorial glaciers.

   Occasional claims that Cotopaxi is the highest active volcano in the
   world are known to be incorrect. Llullaillaco volcano is considerably
   higher and is definitely in an active phase, having erupted as recently
   as 1877. Ojos del Salado is higher still, and there are indications
   near its summit of recent activity, although its remoteness precludes a
   definitive statement as to whether it is currently active.

   There have been more than 50 eruptions of Cotopaxi since 1738. Numerous
   valleys formed by powerful lahars (mudflows) surround the volcano. This
   poses a high risk to the local population, their settlements and
   fields. The city Latacunga has been completely destroyed at least twice
   in its history. Cotopaxi's most violent eruptions in historical times
   occurred in the years 1744, 1768, and 1877. In the 1877 eruption
   pyroclastic flows descended all sides of the mountain, with lahars
   traveling more than 100 km into the Pacific Ocean and western Amazon
   basin. There was a major eruption in 1903 through 1904, and some minor
   activity in 1942.

   The volcano is the subject of 1855 and 1862 paintings by Frederic Edwin
   Church.
