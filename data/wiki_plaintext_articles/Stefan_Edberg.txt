   Stefan Bengt Edberg (born January 19, 1966 in Västervik, Sweden) is a
   former World No. 1 professional tennis player (in both singles and
   doubles play) from Sweden. During his career, he won six Grand Slam
   singles titles and three Grand Slam doubles titles. Edberg is well
   known as one of the best serve and volley players of all time, for his
   superb volleying skills, and as a gentleman and ambassador for the
   sport.

Career

   Edberg first came to the tennis world's attention as a junior player.
   He won all four of the Grand Slam junior titles in 1983 to become the
   first-ever player to achieve the "Junior Grand Slam."

   As a professional, Edberg won his first career doubles title in Basel
   in 1983 and his first top-level singles title at Milan in 1984.

   Edberg's first two Grand Slam singles titles came at the Australian
   Open. In 1985, he defeated Mats Wilander in straight sets to claim his
   first major title. Two years later, he beat Pat Cash in five sets to
   win the last Australian Open held on grass courts. Edberg also won the
   Australian Open and U.S. Open men's doubles titles in 1987 (partnering
   fellow-Swede Anders Järryd).

   In 1988, Edberg reached the first of three consecutive finals at
   Wimbledon. In all three finals, he played Boris Becker. Edberg won
   their first encounter in a four-set match spread over three days
   because of rain delays. A year later, Becker won in straight sets. The
   closest of their matches came in the 1990 final, when Edberg won in
   five sets.

   Edberg claimed the World No. 1 ranking in August 1990 by winning the
   Cincinnati Masters. He held it for the rest of that year and for much
   of 1991 and 1992.

   Edberg's final two Grand Slam singles triumphs came at the U.S. Open,
   with wins over Jim Courier in the 1991 final and Pete Sampras in the
   1992 final, who was just months away from being ranked No. 1 in the
   world.

   Edberg's last Grand Slam singles final appearances were at the
   Australian Open, where he lost in four sets to Jim Courier in both 1992
   and 1993.

   In 1996, Edberg won his third Grand Slam doubles title at Australian
   Open with Petr Korda.

   The only Grand Slam singles title Edberg never won was the French Open.
   He reached the French Open final in 1989 but lost in five sets to
   17-year old Michael Chang, who became the youngest ever male winner of
   a Grand Slam singles title.

   Edberg was most comfortable playing tennis on fast-playing surfaces. Of
   his six Grand Slam singles titles, four were won on grass courts at the
   Australian Open (1985 and 1987) and Wimbledon (1988 and 1990) and two
   were won on hardcourts at the US Open (1991 and 1992).

   Edberg also played on four Swedish Davis Cup winning teams in 1984,
   1985, 1987, and 1994. He appeared in seven Davis Cup finals—a record
   for a Swedish player.

   Edberg was also a member of the Swedish teams that won the World Team
   Cup in 1988, 1991, and 1995.

   At the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, where tennis was a
   demonstration sport, Edberg won the men's singles gold medal. Four
   years later, at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, tennis became a full medal
   sport and Edberg won bronze medals in both the men's singles and the
   men's doubles.

   During his career, Edberg won a total of 42 top-level singles titles
   and 18 doubles titles and appeared in a then record 54 consecutive
   Grand Slam tournaments (broken by Wayne Ferreira). He was ranked the
   World No. 1 for a total of 72 weeks. Edberg was also a five-time
   recipient of the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP)
   Sportsmanship Award (1988-90, 1992, and 1995). In recognition of this
   achievement, the ATP renamed the award the "Edberg Sportsmanship Award"
   in 1996. In 2004, Edberg was inducted into the International Tennis
   Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, USA.

       France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Qatar, Spain,
       Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States.
     * Edberg was awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in 1990.
     * Edberg was involved in a freak accident during the boys' singles

       struck in the groin by a ball struck by Edberg. Wertheim fell
       backwards, fracturing his skull, and died in hospital shortly
       thereafter.

Quote

     * "If he hadn't lived," Edberg later said of Van Allen, "Michael and
       I might still be out there playing!"
          + Background : Jimmy Van Allen (famed for his invention of the
            tennis tiebreak) died on the same day in 1991 that Michael
            Stich narrowly defeated Edberg in a Wimbledon semifinal 4-6,
            7-6(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(2) where Edberg did not lose his serve.
