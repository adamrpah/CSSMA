   The phrase William and Mary usually refers to the joint sovereignty
   over the Kingdom of England, as well the Kingdom of Scotland, of King
   William III and his wife Queen Mary II. Their joint reign began in
   February, 1689, when they were called to the throne by Parliament,
   replacing James II, who was "deemed to have fled" the country in the
   Glorious Revolution of 1688. After Mary died in 1694, William ruled
   alone until his death in 1702. Their rule was the only period in
   British history in which "joint sovereigns" with equal powers were
   allowed to reign; usually, the spouse of the monarch has no power and
   is simply a consort.

   The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia was chartered
   in 1693, endowed and named in their honour.
