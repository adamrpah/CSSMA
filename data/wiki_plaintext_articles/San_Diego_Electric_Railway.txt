   The San Diego Electric Railway (SDERy) was a mass transit system in
   Southern California using streetcars and (in later years) buses. The
   SDERy was established by "sugar heir," developer, and entrepreneur John
   D. Spreckels in 1892. The railroad's original network consisted of 5
   routes, delineated as follows:
     * the Fifth Street and Logan Heights Lines;
     * the First and "D" Streets Lines;
     * the Depot Line;
     * the Ferry Line; and
     * the "K" Street Shuttle.

   The company would establish additional operating divisions as traffic
   demands led to the formation of new lines. The company also engaged in
   limited freight handling primarily as an interchange with Spreckels'
   San Diego and Arizona Railway (SD&A) from 1923 to 1929.

   At its peak, the SDERy's routes would operate throughout the greater
   San Diego area over some 165 miles (266 kilometers) of track.
   Steadily-declining ridership, due in large part to the phenomenal rise
   in popularity of the automobile, ultimately led the company to
   discontinue all streetcar service in favour of bus routes in 1949. The
   demise of some streetcar companies in the United States has been tied
   by some to the alleged General Motors streetcar conspiracy, in which a
   consortium of General Motors, Standard Oil, and others formed a front
   company, National City Lines, in order to buy streetcar lines, shut
   them down, and replace them with buses. The plot of Touchstone
   Pictures' 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit is loosely based on this
   theory.

   The few surviving pieces of rolling stock are on display at the Pacific
   Southwest Railway Museum in Campo, the San Diego Electric Railway
   Association in National City, and the Orange Empire Railway Museum in
   Perris, California.

          "Before you can hope to get people to live anywhere...you must
          first of all show them that they can get there quickly,
          comfortably, and above all, cheaply. Transportation determines
          the flow of population." J.D. Spreckels

     * July 3, 1886: The first horse-drawn open-air streetcar of the San
       Diego Street Car Company (SDSCC) (founded by Hamilton Story and
       Elisa Babcock) makes its run up 5th Street. The fare is five cents.
     * November 9, 1887: The first electrically powered streetcar makes a
       test run on new tracks up Broadway to Kettner Boulevard and on to
       "Old Town."
     * November 19, 1887: Electric streetcar service is inaugurated on the
       San Diego and Old Town Street Railway, making it the first electric
       railway on the west coast and the second in the country to use the
       "ground return" for electric current.
     * 1888: The Electric Rapid Transit Company (ERTC) puts an electric
       streetcar into regular operation in San Diego.
     * July 22, 1889: The San Diego Cable Railway (SDCR) is incorporated
       and takes over the failed ERTC.
     * June 7, 1890: Opening day on the SDCR.
     * September 9, 1890: The SDCR opens "Mission Cliffs Gardens," a small
       recreation park (one of San Diego's first public recreation areas)
       overlooking beautiful Mission Valley, as an end-of-the-line
       attraction for cable car patrons.

     * November 30, 1891: John D. Spreckels incorporates the San Diego
       Electric Railway Company (SDERy).
     * January 30, 1892: The SDERy purchases the SDSCC and the majority of
       its assets for $115,000; over the next few years the company will
       also acquire the competing Park Belt Line and the Ocean Beach
       Railroad. Plans are made to convert all existing lines to traction,
       and ten single-truck, single-trolley, open platform wooden cars are
       subsequently purchased from the J.G. Brill Company.
     * September 19, 1892: Car No. 6 begins shake-down runs on the
       electrified portion of the line.
     * September 21, 1892: Double-decker Car No. 1, the first such
       electrically operated car in the United States, makes the inaugural
       run with many of the City's notables aboard.
     * October 15, 1892: The SDCR makes its last run, the company having
       declared bankruptcy earlier in the year.

     * December 31, 1892: The line has grown to 16.70 miles of aggregated
       system track (12.21 miles of single electrified track with 4.49
       miles for horse-drawn cars). Many new electrified lines will be
       constructed during the coming years.
     * August 1895: The Citizens Traction Company (CTC) is formed and
       purchases the remains of the SDCR for $17,600, adapting the line to
       electric operation in order to compete with the SDERy.
     * July 28, 1896: The first converted trolley car runs the entire
       length of the 4.7-mile long CTC line
     * February 12. 1897: Financial difficulties force the CTC goes into
       receivership.
     * March 23, 1898: Elisa Babcock, as agent for the SDERy, buys the
       properties and franchises of the CTC for $19,000 plus "fees and
       costs." The track gauge is subsequently widened from 3  ft, 6  in
       to standard gauge.
     * 1905: Spreckels builds a new power generating plant to accommodate
       the additional loads imposed by the expanding streetcar network.

     * 1906: Spreckels announces he will form the San Diego and Arizona
       Railway (SD&A) and build a 148-mile line between San Diego and El
       Centro. The Third Avenue Streetcar Line begins operation. The SDERy
       logs 798,152 car miles.
     * 1907: The Third Avenue Streetcar Line is extended to the future
       community of Mission Hills, and is briefly renamed the Mission
       Hills Line.
     * 1910: Spreckels forces a ballot initiative to amend his charter
       with the City of San Diego to give him more than 25 years on his
       leases to operate streetcar service. With this greater security he
       is able to acquire major loans for service expansion and
       infrastructure.
     * 1911: The Imperial Avenue operating division is established in
       downtown. Spreckels builds second power generating plant at Kettner
       Boulevard and "E" Street when the plant built in 1905 can no longer
       provide sufficient capacity.
     * 1913: Construction of a new brick car barn located at Adams Avenue
       and Florida Street is completed.
     * December 31, 1914: The SDERy owns 38.9 miles of single track and
       22.4 miles of double track, for a total of 83.7 miles of
       "equivalent single track."
     * 1915: The Panama-California Exposition in Balboa Park spurs the
       next phase of transportation growth. A new electric car line is
       constructed up 12th Street to the Park's entrance with 101 new cars
       from the St. Louis Car Company and the Adams Avenue operating
       division is established in Normal Heights. San Diego's original
       Victorian style train depot is demolished and replaced with a new
       Mission Revival Style Santa Fe depot building. The SDERy logs
       3,521,571 car miles.
     * 1916: The "Great Flood" washes out several rail lines. World War I
       increases the cost of railway construction materials by 50 to 150
       percent. There is a significant increase in the private ownership
       of automobiles and the SDERy begins to lose revenue to private
       "Jitney Buses."
     * November 15, 1919: The "golden spike" is driven and construction of
       the SD&A is ceremonially completed at a cost of $18 million (three
       times the original estimate).
     * 1920: Spreckels announces plans to discontinue service on several
       rail lines to offset expenses, leading to approval of "zone fares".
       The SDERy purchases new streetcars that requires only one
       driver/conductor instead of two; older cars are retrofitted to
       reduce labor costs. Spreckels sells his power generating plants to
       the Consolidated Gas and Electric Company.
     * 1921: The first motor bus goes into service operating between
       National City and Chula Vista. "Number One" has hard rubber tires,
       two-wheel mechanical brakes, a four-cylinder engine, and a plywood
       body.
     * March 17, 1923: The SDERy begins its last major rail line expansion
       to Mission Beach ("Belmont Park"), Pacific Beach, and La Jolla.
       $2.5 million is spent on rails, Mission Revival Style terminals and
       substations, and Egyptian Revival Style stations, and $800,000 is
       spent on the acquisition of 50 new cars. Construction is completed
       in 1925.
     * December 18, 1923: Car No. 400, an all-steel model with a closed
       body and the first on the SDERy to feature a pantograph-type
       current collector, is delivered. All 50 pantograph-equipped cars
       would eventually have trolley poles installed at each end due to
       the pantographs' poor performance.
     * 1930: Buses begin to replace street cars from Ocean Beach to La
       Jolla, and 222 new buses are added to the fleet. Ridership and
       revenue goes down but the SDERy is able to weather the economic
       downturn.
     * 1935: The California Pacific International Exposition opens in
       Balboa Park without the need for expanded transit service.
     * 1936: The SDERy orders 25 single-end Presidents Conference
       Committee (P.C.C.) cars from the St. Louis Car Company, becoming
       the first streetcar system in the United States to utilize
       streamlined units. The cars are designated as Class 6. An order for
       3 additional units is placed the following year.
     * 1941: World War II turns San Diego into a "boom town" again.
       Defense related industries revitalize the city, as does an influx
       of military personnel. Ridership on public transit increases 600
       percent during the war years. Used transit vehicles are purchased
       from around the nation, and more electrical power is needed and
       substations are built (one in the basement of the Spreckels Theatre
       Building on Broadway). The $2.5 million rail line built in the
       1920s to the beaches is ripped out along with the elaborate
       stations and terminals and replaced with a bus line.
     * 1942: The combined streetcar and bus lines carry 94 million people.
       Additional streetcars are brought in on loan from New York City,
       Salt Lake City, Utah and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to help keep up
       with demand.
     * 1944: Combined ridership increases lead to more than 146 million
       trips.
     * 1945: Cars No. 502 and No. 503 are painted red and blue (in lieu of
       the standard golden yellow) to the American Red Cross blood
       donation campaign.
     * 1946: The SDERy begins to phase out streetcar lines and replace
       them with bus routes. By the following year, only 3 street car
       lines will remain in operation.
     * July 26, 1948: The Western Transit Company (WTC) purchases the
       SDERy.
     * August 1948: 13 new 45-passenger buses are placed into service.
     * September 9, 1948: The WTC announces that the SDERy will henceforth
       be known as the San Diego Transit System (SDTS), for $5.5 million.
       A new emblem (consisting of a pair of wings with a shield in the
       centre) and slogan, "Safety, Courtesy, Service," are adopted.
     * January 13, 1949: The SDTS borrows $720,000 for the purchase of
       additional new buses, and makes an application to the State Public
       Utilities Commission (PUC) to discontinue streetcar service.
     * March 3, 1949: The PUC grants authority to the SDTS to abandon its
       remaining streetcar lines.
     * March 27, 1949: A "farewell to the streetcars" excursion, operated
       over the remaining trackage, is sponsored by the Pacific Railroad
       Society of Los Angeles.
     * April 23, 1949: 45 new GM buses (each costing $20,000) parade down
       Broadway to mark the retirement of the street cars; free rides are
       offered during the procession.
     * April 24, 1949: Rail service on the SDERy comes to an end at 5:45
       a.m. as Car No. 446 pulls into the Adams Avenue car barn, making
       San Diego the first major Southwestern United States city to
       eliminate streetcars and convert to an all-bus transit system.
     * May 23, 1949: Work crews begin removing the overhead trolley lines
       and tracks on the loop at downtown's Union Station.
     * 1950: 17 of the P.C.C. model cars are sold to the El Paso City
       Lines (EPCL) for service on the international loop between El Paso,
       Texas and the Mexican border town of Juarez, Mexico.
     * 1952: Three more P.C.C.'s are sold to EPCL. All remaining Class 5
       cars and the 3 "service" cars are purchased by the Allied Salvage
       Company for scrap.
     * August 1957: The 8 remaining P.C.C.'s are purchased by the San
       Diego Mill Supply Company. Car No. 508 is acquired by the Orange
       Empire Traction Company for display at its museum in Perris,
       California, and Car No. 528 is obtained by the Railway Historical
       Society of San Diego for preservation and exhibition.
     * July 19, 1981: After years of planning and development, the " San
       Diego Trolley" (a new interurban light rail mass transit system)
       makes its inaugural run on the 15.9-mile long "South Line" between
       the U.S. International Border and Centre City San Diego.
     * July 26, 1981: The San Diego Trolley begins revenue service; San
       Diego will become known in transit circles as "The city that
       started the 'light rail craze' in the United States."
     * February 14, 2005: The San Diego Electric Railway Association
       salvages the body shell of Car No. 357 (formerly of the Bellingham,
       Washington streetcar system) from a Centre City San Diego
       restaurant site where it had been used as a "dining room" since
       1972.
     * December 14, 2005: The San Diego Vintage Trolley Co. purchases two
       former San Francisco Municipal Railway PCC cars. The cars are
       expected to run on a loop around Centre City using existing San
       Diego Trolley tracks; service may start in 2008.
