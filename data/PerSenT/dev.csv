3360,AS VALUES DROP MORE HOMEOWNERS WALKING AWAY FROM MORTGAGES,Benjamin Koellmann,"In 2006  Benjamin Koellmann bought a condominium in Miami Beach. By his calculation  it will be about the year 2025 before he can sell his modest home for what he paid. Or maybe 2040.
 ""People like me are beginning to feel like suckers "" Koellmann said. ""Why not let it go in default and rent a better place for less?""
 ""There is no financial sense in staying "" Koellmann said. With the $1 500 he is paying each month for his mortgage  taxes and insurance  he could rent a nicer place on the beach  one with a gym  security and valet parking.
 Walking away  he knows  is not without peril. At minimum  it would ruin his credit score. Koellmann would like to attend graduate school. If an admission dean sees a dismal credit record  would that count against him? How about a new employer?
 Koellmann applied last fall to Bank of America for a modification  noting that his income had slipped. But the lender came back a few weeks ago with a plan that added more restrictive terms while keeping the payments about the same.

 Lugo fired his army  navy and air force commanders on Wednesday  a day after claiming there were ""pockets of coup-plotters"" in the armed forces.
 Opponents accuse Lugo of styling himself after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in his focus on helping the poor in this land-locked South American country.
 Lugo's opponents in Congress are hoping to gather a two-thirds majority to remove him from office under the constitution.
 Opponents say that Lugo has been incompetent in failing to focus on a crime wave that includes kidnappings and robbery  as well as administrative improprieties.
 Lugo's support base has been eroding under a growing scandal in which three women claim he fathered their children while he was a priest. In May  he admitted responsibility for one of the children.","Lugo  a former Catholic bishop who assumed office in August 2008  sacked Rear Admiral Ciber Benitez.

3365,Thailand Going After Protesters' Financial Backers,Thaksin Shinawatra,"The arson attacks mirrored  albeit with far more violence  a campaign launched in early 2006 by opponents of Thaksin to boycott businesses close to the then prime minister. Six months later  the military removed Thaksin and set up a commission to investigate his business network.
 That investigation began a long effort to choke off Thaksin's money. It climaxed in February when Thailand's Supreme Court confiscated $1.4 billion of frozen Thaksin assets. The court ruling allowed him to keep about $900 million. Soon after the court decision  red shirts began mobilizing for an occupation of downtown Bangkok.
 Sean Boonpracong  a former resident of Herndon  Va.  who helped lead the red- shirt invasion  said after release from military interrogation over the weekend that protesters got $130 000 a day _ far less than official estimates _ from ""friends of Thaksin"" for food  generator fuel and other supplies. He denied that any had been used to buy weapons  adding that red shirts discussed setting up an armed wing but rejected the idea.
 Some of those on the blacklist sympathized with the red shirt cause  which boiled down to a demand that the government quit and call early elections that would possibly return Thaksin's allies to power. A shopping center owned by one targeted businessman leased space to a host of now-defunct red-shirt ventures  including an anti-government TV station  a journal called Red News  the Red Cafe and also the Red Shop  filled with Thaksin dolls  Thaksin T-shirts and books praising Thaksin.

But midway through the testing period on the new temporary cap that was bottling up the crude inside the well  the pressure readings were not rising as high as expected  said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen  the government's point man on the crisis.
 Allen said two possible reasons were being debated by scientists: The reservoir that is the source of the oil could be running lower than expected three months into the spill. Or there could be an undiscovered leak somewhere down in the well. Allen ordered further study but remained confident.
 ""This is generally good news "" he said. But he cautioned  ""We need to be careful not to do any harm or create a situation that cannot be reversed.""
 He said the testing would go on into the night  at which point BP may decide whether to reopen the cap and allow some oil to spill into the sea again.
 Pressure readings after 24 hours were about 6 700 pounds per square inch and rising slowly  Allen said  below the 7 500 psi that would clearly show the well was not leaking. He said pressure continued to rise between 2 and 10 psi per hour. A low pressure reading  or a falling one  could mean the oil is escaping.

That ’ s the question "" The American Question "" ( produced by  Guy Seemann  and directed by James Kicklighter ) is intended to answer when it hits the festival circuit this year . The documentary film challenges Americans to stop blaming others about the current social and political climate and to question how their own decisions and actions shape the country . The film has taken  Seemann  and Kicklighter around the nation to ask questions about family   money and civics with the objective of getting viewers to consider whether divisions in our society stem from group dynamics or if we ' re all part of the problem as individuals . In a series of interviews   the film features dozens of Americans from across political   economic and social spectrums . A teaser for the production was released in November 2017 .

SEE MORE VIDEOS “ American values are written down in the founding documents : the Constitution   Declaration of Independence   ” Seemann  said . “ Those values — concepts of opportunity and equality   different types of freedoms   concepts of hard work and the American dream … those are concepts they defined then and we still talk about today . Now   the real question is how are people defining those values for themselves today ? Are they defining them in the context that the founders had   or are people redefining them to the point where they see someone else as an enemy of those values ?” People exist now in their own bubbles of isolation   where it ’ s much easier for folks to peg others as enemies because “ we ’ re only listening to things   finding things and sharing things that only substantiate what we already believe  ” Kicklighter said . To break out of these bubbles   the duo believe   the majority of Americans need to agree and adhere to a baseline of values they think are the same as those of their neighbors . “ The American Question ” is that wake - up call to the country   said Seemann — a “ cautionary tale ” to the masses to not regress   but to progress . Kicklighter and Seemann use values as the foundation that joins individuals and community together . Less individual mindset   more connection . Less division   more community . “ Once you agree that you share the same value system with your neighbor   that ’ s when you actually see progress   that ’ s when you have mutual respect   and the community comes back together  ” Seemann said . “ If you can convince people this is a national concept   that everyone is pretty much in the same boat — that ’ s when you won ’ t want to be in your own bubble . You will challenge your own perspective and negative viewpoints .” The documentary team doesn ’ t consider its film revolutionary . Seemann and Kicklighter said academics like Robert Putnam   author of “ Bowling Alone  ” and Charles Murray   author of “ Coming Apart  ” have been foreshadowing the current political and social climate for years   but Kicklighter and Seeman are making a film with the hope that it will reach more eyes .

The goal is to have enough of an impact   by melding data and emotion   to start a national conversation   Seemann and Kicklighter said . “ It is really tough to get more than 300 million people pointed in one direction and on the same page   but the value system continues to push us in the right direction  ” Seemann said . “ We want people to recognize ( what needs to be done ): Secure the founding values   execute them more properly .

Almost Everything   Says Report Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Updated at 6 : 30 p . m . ET An independent review of Charlottesville ' s handling of the white nationalist rally there in August found that law enforcement and city officials made several significant mistakes   resulting in violence and distrust . The city commissioned the report   which was prepared by  Timothy Heaphy    a former U . S . attorney in Virginia . In conducting the investigation    Heaphy  said  his  team pored through hundreds of thousands of documents   interviewed hundreds of witnesses   and reviewed countless hours of video and audio . The resulting 220 - page report is a detailed record of the chaos and conflict that unspooled in the Virginia college town . It is unsparing in identifying the errors authorities made that day and in the preceding months . The city failed to protect either free expression or public safety   the report finds : "" This represents a failure of one of government ' s core functions — the protection of fundamental rights . Law enforcement also failed to maintain order and protect citizens from harm   injury   and death . Charlottesville preserved neither of those principles on August 12   which has led to deep distrust of government within this community ."" The "" most tragic manifestation "" of the failure to protect public safety was the death of 32 - year - old Heather Heyer   the report says . "" Early on August 12   CPD had placed a school resource officer alone at the intersection of 4th Street NE and Market Street  "" the report explains . "" This officer feared for her safety as groups of angry Alt - Right protesters and counter - protesters streamed by her as they left Emancipation Park . The officer called for assistance and was relieved of her post . Unfortunately   CPD commanders did not replace her or make other arrangements to prevent traffic from traveling across the Downtown Mall on 4th Street ."" All that remained to impede traffic was a single wooden sawhorse .

Heyer  "" it says . The report praised the city ' s fire department and the University of Virginia Health System for their quick response to victims of the car attack   calling it "" a bright success on a day largely filled with failure ."" Some of the problems identified in the report echo the criticism of law enforcement response at the time ; some are new revelations .

Police did not adequately separate conflicting groups   which led to physical altercations . Police commanders instructed their officers not to intervene in all but the most serious physical confrontations . They prepared to respond to violence by declaring an unlawful assembly and dispersing the crowd .

Officers remained behind barricades in relatively empty areas   rather than being stationed along crucial routes as protesters and counterprotesters shifted and clashed .

3390,Volunteers In NYC Show Support For Immigrants At Court Appearances Appointments : NPR,Jean Hale,"Volunteers In NYC Show Support For Immigrants At Court Appearances   Appointments A new type of volunteer opportunity has taken off in New York City . Hundreds of people are going with immigrants to court appearances and appointments with immigration officials . With President Trump ' s crackdown on illegal immigration   they want to show solidarity   and be a friendly support system . ROBERT SIEGEL   HOST : A new type of volunteer opportunity has taken off in New York City . Hundreds of people are going with immigrants to court appearances and appointments with immigration officials . With President Trump ' s crackdown on illegal immigration   the volunteers want to show solidarity . WNYC ' s Beth Fertig brings us this story . OK   tell me your name . BETH FERTIG   BYLINE : On a recent weekday morning   Marissa Lohse is gathering her troops in a coffeeshop in lower Manhattan . LOHSE : Perfect   perfect . FERTIG : Lohse is with the New Sanctuary Coalition . It ' s a network of congregations and individuals who accompany immigrants facing deportation to the Federal Building   which is just down the street .  Jean Hale  is a first - time volunteer .  She  doesn ' t know what to expect .  HALE  : I think it may be just emotional support and perhaps a big hug . FERTIG :  Hale  says  she  ' s horrified by the Trump administration ' s aggressive enforcement of immigration laws .  She  ' s 73   a retired English as a Second Language teacher . The volunteer program took off in 2010 during a previous crackdown under former President Obama . But Lohse - herself an immigrant from Argentina - says it ' s now bigger than ever . Several hundred volunteers came forward after Trump took office . A lot are retirees like her . They call the immigrants   friends . LOHSE : Before   I was just going by myself with a friend . Now it ' s just   thank God we have so many volunteers . So I do it   and I cry when I think about it . FERTIG : There ' s a lot on the line . These volunteers are joining people at immigration court hearings to determine whether they can stay in the country . Others are bringing them to check - ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Many undocumented immigrants were allowed to stay as long as they regularly met with ICE . These check - ins used to be routine . Now   some immigrants are detained without any warning . Lohse has seen that firsthand . LOHSE : I ' ve been one time when I was with a wife of a guy . Then   the ICE agent came out with a pair of glasses and a wallet . Your husband wants you to have this . They didn ' t give a chance for her to say goodbye . FERTIG : This type of volunteering is not easy . It ' s emotional   and the issues are thorny . At a training session   volunteers are told all immigrants deserve support   even those who have committed crimes . That gave one man pause . ED STUBIN : I can accept that the criminal justice system isn ' t always right   but I ' m troubled having to go with some people that I don ' t think should be on this earth   much less in this country . FERTIG : That ' s Ed Stubin   a business owner who says his father was an immigrant . He decides he will volunteer   however   when a coordinator assures him that immigrants who commit serious crimes are usually held in detention . On the day of the coffeehouse meeting   about 40 volunteers are joining eight immigrants . One of those immigrants is Inez   a young mother seeking asylum who doesn ' t want us using her full name . She ' s got her 3 - year - old son with her   and she ' s grateful to have six of the volunteers going with her to immigration court . INEZ : ( Foreign language spoken ). FERTIG : The group includes  Jean Hale   the retired teacher and first - time volunteer  .  They  spent four hours in the waiting room outside court . Mostly    they  played with Inez ' s toddler . Finally   Inez had her hearing . The judge gave her three more months to find a lawyer . Afterward   outside the federal building    Hale  said some undocumented immigrants deserve to stay .  HALE  : I would like to see our laws changed so that people could remain who have come to our country . FERTIG :  Hale  also said  she  ' ll continue to volunteer .

3394,Japan's navy appoints first woman to command warship squadron,Ryoko Azuma,Japan ’ s navy on Tuesday appointed the first woman to command a warship squadron   including the flagship Izumo helicopter carrier   as it tries to lure more females to make up for a dearth of male recruits in graying Japan .  Ryoko Azuma    will command four ships with a combined crew of 1   000   of which only 30 are women   that make up the Maritime Self Defense Force ’ s ( MSDF ) First Escort Division . “ I don ’ t think about being a woman .

3396,FCC chief plans to ditch U.S. 'net neutrality' rules,Ajit Pai,The head of the U . S . Federal Communications Commission unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape .  FCC chief Ajit Pai   a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January    said the commission will vote at a Dec . 14 meeting on  his  plan to rescind the so - called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities . The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content . They were intended to ensure a free and open internet   give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content . The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT & T Inc   Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price . It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc   which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules . Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “ roll back these core protections .” With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners   the move is all but certain to be approved . Trump   a Republican   expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented   calling it a “ power grab ” by Obama . The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday .  Pai  said  his  proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “ inherently an interstate service .” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic - governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers ’ equal access to internet content . “ The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro - competitive  ”  Pai  said in an interview   adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “ heavy - handed ” regulation of the internet . “ We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses  ”  Pai  added . Tom Wheeler   who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules   called the planned repeal “ a shameful sham and sellout . Even for this FCC and its leadership   this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights .” AT & T   Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing . Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “ not block   throttle   or discriminate against lawful content .” ‘ HEAVY COSTS ’ Verizon said it believed the FCC “ will reinstate a framework that protects consumers ’ access to the open internet   without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation .” Ajit Pai   Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission   testifies before a Senate Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee on Capitol Hill in Washington   U . S .  June 20   2017 . REUTERS / Aaron P . Bernstein The Internet Association   representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook   said Pai ’ s proposal “ represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans .” “ This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans ’ ability to access the entire internet  ” it said . Pai ’ s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so - called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content . Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency   the Federal Trade Commission   to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers   Pai said . The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “ anticompetitive ” or violated antitrust rules . The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) logo is seen before the FCC Net Neutrality hearing in Washington February 26   2015 . REUTERS / Yuri Gripas The FCC received more than 22 million comments . New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments . A U . S . appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations   which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom . The group praised Pai ’ s decision to remove “ antiquated   restrictive regulations ” to “ pave the way for broadband network investment   expansion and upgrades .” The FCC ’ s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality . Nancy Pelosi   the top U . S . House of Representatives Democrat   said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition   saying the agency “ has launched an all - out assault on the entrepreneurship   innovation and competition at the heart of the internet .” The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January . Trump has abandoned international trade deals   the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections   taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba   and sought repeal Obama ’ s signature healthcare law . Pai   who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman   is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda . Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials . The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies . Language in the new proposal would give the FCC significantly less authority to oversee the web . The FCC granted initial approval to Pai ’ s plan in May   but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct . His plan would eliminate the “ internet conduct standard  ” which gave the FCC far - reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices .,The head of the U . S .

3400,U.S. expands leniency for companies that disclose foreign bribery,Rod Rosenstein,The U . S . Justice Department will extend greater leniency to companies that voluntarily alert authorities when they learn employees have paid bribes to foreign officials   Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said on Wednesday . FILE PHOTO : The exterior of the U . S . Department of Justice headquarters building in Washington   DC   U . S . on July 14   2009 . REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst / File Photo The new guidelines will allow most companies to avoid prosecution altogether if they fully disclose foreign bribery   cooperate in the investigation and take steps to avoid future misconduct    Rosenstein  said at a Maryland legal conference . This will prompt greater corporate cooperation with authorities    he  said . “ We want corporate officers and board members to better understand the costs and benefits of cooperation .” The changes come at a time when U . S . Attorney General Jeff Sessions has asked prosecutors to take a tougher line against criminals   particularly in drug cases . The guidelines expand a pilot program   launched in 2016 by the Obama administration   to encourage more companies to come forward when they discover foreign bribery   in exchange for lighter penalties . The U . S . Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime for companies to bribe overseas officials to win business . While the previous program allowed for no prosecution   the new rules offer the “ presumption ” that charges will be dropped if companies come forward and fully cooperate .  Rosenstein  said that because corporate crimes are ultimately committed by people   not firms   companies should not be prosecuted by the same standard . “ It makes sense to treat corporations differently than individuals  ”  he  said . In cases when the misconduct is so severe that the Justice Department cannot drop charges   the guidelines will still allow companies that come forward to get a 50 percent reduction of the lowest level of penalty . But the requirements that companies must meet for prosecutors to drop charges will be “ rigorous ” and give authorities more ammunition to pursue individual executives involved in the crimes   senior Justice Department officials told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday . “ I don ’ t think it ’ s accurate at all to portray or understand this policy as giving a pass to corporate crime  ” a U .

3411,Apps To Document Street Harassment Give Global Women A Way To Speak Out : Goats and Soda : NPR,Noora Finkleman,"In Egypt  there's HarassMap. Co-founder Noora Finkleman and other activists initially developed the platform in order to soften the taboo of discussing sexual harassment.
""Back when we first launched in 2010  in our culture it was just normal to ignore harassment or deny that it was happening ""  Finkleman  says. At the time  Egypt's first lady Suzanne Mubarak even alleged that the problem of harassment had been blown out of proportion by Islamic extremists looking to push their own agenda.
""So we said  why not have an online technology that allows women to anonymously report their experiences ""  Finkleman  says  ""so we can start documenting that this is actually happening  that this is a widespread problem.""

3414,What Could Kill the Bitcoin Boom,Bitcoin,"If you bought a Bitcoin in early 2017  when one cost less than $900  you could have a profit of more than 1 200 percent now. But you almost certainly didn’t do that. Perhaps you dipped in a toe in November or December  as the price hit headline-grabbing records—$10 000  then $15 000  then higher. If you were very unlucky and bought at the peak of about $20 000 on Dec. 17  you’d have lost more than 40 percent of your money as of Jan. 16  when the price was $11 200. More than $2 000 of that decline came in about 24 hours  after South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon indicated the country may crack down on cryptocurrency trading to discourage speculation. It’s not every asset that can feel like it’s in a bubble and a crash at the same time.
But based on no other valuation metric than what it cost a year ago  the price of  Bitcoin  is still dizzyingly high. For the many doubters who can’t believe things have come this far—and for  Bitcoin  owners who can see how much they might lose—the big question is what it would take to knock the price back further.
In past episodes  “ Bitcoin  and digital currencies have been incredibly resilient to bad news ” says Meltem Demirors  director of development at Digital Currency Group  which invests in  Bitcoin  and related technologies. Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Mt. Gox  Bitfinex  and BTC-e have been hacked over the years  with hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of  Bitcoin  stolen. China in September moved to shut down exchange trading of the cryptocurrency. None of these permanently stopped  Bitcoin ’s rise up the price charts  especially after  it  drew the attention of hedge fund traders and futures markets.
One doomsday scenario would be a successful hack of the blockchain. That’s the underlying technology that records and verifies every transaction  using exact copies of a database spread on computers all over the world. Those host computers  called miners  are rewarded with new Bitcoin for doing the work of verifying transactions. An attacker might be able to alter the blockchain’s history by marshaling more than half the computing power on the network. But that would be monumentally difficult; someone with the technology to do it could instead “opt into the game” and get paid to mine Bitcoin  says Tyler Winklevoss  co-founder of the Gemini digital asset exchange and one of the largest  Bitcoin  holders.
The likelier risks are far more pedestrian. The first is that while plenty of investors and speculators have piled into  Bitcoin    it ’s a difficult currency to use in the real world. The network is slow and expensive for small transactions. And who wants to spend $4 in  Bitcoin  for a coffee if next week that could be worth $8? “My big concern as a company is that digital currency doesn’t find its quote-unquote killer use cases  where people are saying  ‘Wow  we now have tens of millions of daily active users that are using it for payments ’ ” says Adam White  who runs GDAX  the exchange for institutional investors run by Coinbase. “That’s one of the largest existential threats to the company.”
There’s been a very public civil war among  Bitcoin  developers: One group favors changes to the network  the other doesn’t. “It’s got to have the developer community come together and figure out how to scale it properly and continuously ” says Sheri Kaiserman  a managing director at Wedbush Securities and an early Wall Street believer in  Bitcoin ’s potential. Meanwhile   Bitcoin  faces competition from other digital currencies  from Bitcoin Cash to Litecoin to Ether  which have also seen big gains and wild swings.
You could spend weeks learning about the nuances of the various cryptocurrencies. But the main risk to  Bitcoin  is actually the easiest to understand. “The biggest factor in what’s driving the price up is potentially what will drive it down—a reversal of animal spirits ” says Adam Ludwin  chief executive officer of blockchain startup Chain. “There is essentially a belief this will continue to go up. If people believe it will continue to go down  that’s self-reinforcing.”
To explain that psychology  Ludwin invokes John Maynard Keynes. The economist likened investing to a newspaper contest where readers were asked to pick the picture of the person the majority of other people would find most attractive. To win  a reader would have to discard his own judgment and bet purely on a guess of what the average person would find beautiful. Or  maddeningly  even on what the other players would think the average player would like. Cryptocurrency in general is “really one of the most beautiful distillations of the Keynesian beauty contest that’s ever existed ” says Ludwin. All investments have some of this speculative element  but unlike  say  a stock   Bitcoin  isn’t a claim on future earnings to which investors can hitch a valuation. To bet on  Bitcoin  is to believe simply that others will want  it .
One read on the psychology of  the Bitcoin boom  is that  it ’s part of a broad bull market in all kinds of assets. Despite anxieties about politics  North Korea  and rising equity valuations  investors seem to be in a mood to embrace risk and are fearful of missing out on big gains. Or perhaps  Bitcoin  is the shadow side of that optimism: Many are drawn to cryptocurrency because they see  it  as a palliative to the system that came crashing down in 2008  and their belief in  Bitcoin  has been hard to shake. Market psychology is difficult to pin down—the one thing that’s reliable about it is its volatility.","If you bought a Bitcoin in early 2017  when one cost less than $900  you could have a profit of more than 1 200 percent now.

None of these permanently stopped  [TGT] ’s rise up the price charts  especially after  [TGT]  drew the attention of hedge fund traders and futures markets.
One doomsday scenario would be a successful hack of the blockchain. That’s the underlying technology that records and verifies every transaction  using exact copies of a database spread on computers all over the world. Those host computers  called miners  are rewarded with [TGT] for doing the work of verifying transactions. An attacker might be able to alter the blockchain’s history by marshaling more than half the computing power on the network. But that would be monumentally difficult; someone with the technology to do it could instead “opt into the game” and get paid to [TGT]says Tyler Winklevoss  co-founder of the Gemini digital asset exchange and one of the largest  Bitcoin  holders.
The likelier risks are far more pedestrian. The first is that while plenty of investors and speculators have piled into  Bitcoin    it ’s a difficult currency to use in the real world. The network is slow and expensive for small transactions. And who wants to spend $4 in  Bitcoin  for a coffee if next week that could be worth $8? “My big concern as a company is that digital currency doesn’t find its quote-unquote killer use cases  where people are saying  ‘Wow  we now have tens of millions of daily active users that are using it for payments ’ ” says Adam White  who runs GDAX  the exchange for institutional investors run by Coinbase. “That’s one of the largest existential threats to the company.”
There’s been a very public civil war among  [TGT]developers: One group favors changes to the network  the other doesn’t. “It’s got to have the developer community come together and figure out how to scale it properly and continuously ” says Sheri Kaiserman  a managing director at Wedbush Securities and an early Wall Street believer in  [TGT] ’s potential. Meanwhile   [TGT]faces competition from other digital currencies  from Bitcoin Cash to Litecoin to Ether  which have also seen big gains and wild swings.
You could spend weeks learning about the nuances of the various cryptocurrencies. But the main risk to  Bitcoin  is actually the easiest to understand. “The biggest factor in what’s driving the price up is potentially what will drive it down—a reversal of animal spirits ” says Adam Ludwin  chief executive officer of blockchain startup Chain. “There is essentially a belief this will continue to go up. If people believe it will continue to go down  that’s self-reinforcing.”
To explain that psychology  Ludwin invokes John Maynard Keynes. The economist likened investing to a newspaper contest where readers were asked to pick the picture of the person the majority of other people would find most attractive. To win  a reader would have to discard his own judgment and bet purely on a guess of what the average person would find beautiful. Or  maddeningly  even on what the other players would think the average player would like. Cryptocurrency in general is “really one of the most beautiful distillations of the Keynesian beauty contest that’s ever existed ” says Ludwin. All investments have some of this speculative element  but unlike  say  a stock   Bitcoin  isn’t a claim on future earnings to which investors can hitch a valuation. To bet on  [TGT]is to believe simply that others will want  [TGT] .
One read on the psychology of  the Bitcoin boom  is that  it ’s part of a broad bull market in all kinds of assets. Despite anxieties about politics  North Korea  and rising equity valuations  investors seem to be in a mood to embrace risk and are fearful of missing out on big gains. Or perhaps  [TGT]is the shadow side of that optimism: Many are drawn to cryptocurrency because they see  it  as a palliative to the system that came crashing down in 2008  and their belief in  [TGT]has been hard to shake. Market psychology is difficult to pin down—the one thing that’s reliable about it is its volatility.",Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,,,,,,,

3424,Harvey Weinstein : NYPD investigated sex assault complaint against producer in 2015,Harvey Weinstein,"Multiple women have accused  Harvey Weinstein  of sexual assault in a new report from The New Yorker magazine.

Others  including actresses Mira Sorvino and Rosanna Arquette  told the magazine they believe they were removed from projects and their careers suffered after rejecting  Weinstein 's advances.
A spokesperson for the beleaguered movie executive told The New Yorker: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by  Mr. Weinstein .""
"" Mr. Weinstein  has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.  Mr. Weinstein  obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations  but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record   Mr. Weinstein  believes that all of these relationships were consensual "" according to the full statement from Weinstein's spokesperson. "" Mr. Weinstein  has begun counseling  has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.  Mr. Weinstein  is hoping that  if  he  makes enough progress   he  will be given a second chance.”
Farrow's reporting in the magazine is also supported with a recording obtained from a New York Police Department sting operation from 2015 involving  Weinstein  and Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.
In the recording  the model asked  Weinstein  why  he  had groped her breasts the day before.  He  replied  ""Oh  please  I’m sorry  just come on in. I’m used to that. Come on. Please "" according to the magazine.
As the recording continues   Weinstein  tries to convince her to come into  his  hotel room while  he  showers  despite her protests. After a nearly 2-minute encounter   he  agrees to let Gutierrez leave.

GOP scrambling after Wilson says he won't run for governor,Harry Wilson,"Langworthy  like many Republican leaders  was hoping  wealthy business turnaround expert Harry Wilson  would run against Cuomo. But The News reported late Sunday night that  Wilson  has decided not to get in the race because of family considerations.
Republicans believed  Wilson   who told people  he  was prepared to spend up to $10 million of  his  own money on the race  had the money and record to mount a credible challenge against Cuomo  who in July reported having $26 million in  his  campaign kitty.
“The candidate who was universally seen as our likely nominee if  he  got in the race stepping aside puts more pressure on the party to evaluate the talent who have already identified themselves as potential candidates ” Langworthy said. “But it's also incumbent on party leaders and others to look outside the declared candidates to see who gives us the best chance to win.”

3427,Paul Manafort Rick Gates Back In Court For Bail Negotiations : NPR,Paul Manafort,"Paul Manafort  Rick Gates Back In Court For Bail Negotiations
 Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a former top aide Rick Gates  were in court again on Monday to negotiate a bail agreement. The two have been confined to  their  homes since pleading not guilty to charges stemming from the Russia investigation.
Two of President Trump's former campaign aides were back in court today   former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy  Rick Gates .  They  face money laundering and other charges as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. NPR's Ryan Lucas was in the courtroom earlier today  and he's with us now. And Ryan   Manafort  and Gates were indicted at the end of October. Why were they back in court today?
RYAN LUCAS  BYLINE: Well  today's hearing touched on a number of things. And there's one significant matter that is still being worked out  and that is a bail package for  Manafort . It's kind of weird that it's taken so long. Today the judge had questions about the assessed values of some of the real estate that  Manafort 's defense team has put forward in their proposed bail package.
Just over a week ago  it looked like  Manafort  had reached an agreement with the special counsel's office on a bail deal that would get him out of home confinement. A few days later  the special counsel's team says  hold on. You know  we've changed our mind. The reason for this  they said  was that  Manafort  was anonymously co-authoring an editorial with a Russian associate with ties - alleged ties to Russia's intelligence services.
SIEGEL: Let's focus on that for a moment. You're saying that after he was indicted   Manafort  has been in contact with someone who's linked to a Russian spy service. What more can you tell us about that?
LUCAS: Well  it is pretty weird  yes. There's - a quick reminder basically about what this is all about. So prosecutors say that  Manafort  helped ghost write an English-language op-ed for a Ukrainian newspaper. The editorial portrayed him in a favorable light. And Manafort's associates in Ukraine say that  Manafort  didn't really have much of a role in this. But in court papers that prosecutors filed on Friday  they provided an exhibit that showed specific changes that they say  Manafort  made to the draft. And they have the times that those changes were made.
Now  there are a host of problems with  Manafort 's actions according to prosecutors  but the big one is that it was a violation of the judge's gag order not to try the case in the press  in the public sphere. And for prosecutors  they also say that it raises questions about  you know  trust when it comes to his bail. Now  today Manafort's attorney defended the op-ed and said that since it was for a Ukrainian newspaper  it's not a big deal. Manafort's not on trial in Ukraine. He said Manafort's reputation is under attack in the press and that Manafort was just trying to set the record straight.","Paul Manafort  Rick Gates Back In Court For Bail Negotiations
 [TGT]were in court again on Monday to negotiate a bail agreement. The two have been confined to  [TGT]  homes since pleading not guilty to charges stemming from the Russia investigation.
Two of President Trump's former campaign aides were back in court today   [TGT] .  [TGT]  face money laundering and other charges as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. NPR's Ryan Lucas was in the courtroom earlier today  and he's with us now. And Ryan   Manafort  and Gates were indicted at the end of October. Why were they back in court today?
RYAN LUCAS  BYLINE: Well  today's hearing touched on a number of things. And there's one significant matter that is still being worked out  and that is a bail package for  [TGT] . It's kind of weird that it's taken so long. Today the judge had questions about the assessed values of some of the real estate that  Manafort 's defense team has put forward in their proposed bail package.
Just over a week ago  it looked like  [TGT]had reached an agreement with the special counsel's office on a bail deal that would get [TGT] out of home confinement. A few days later  the special counsel's team says  hold on. You know  we've changed our mind. The reason for this  they said  was that  [TGT]was anonymously co-authoring an editorial with a Russian associate with ties - alleged ties to Russia's intelligence services.

3428,Brazil detains Italian fugitive Battisti leaving country,Cesare Battisti,"Italian former leftist guerrilla Cesare Battisti  leaves the headquarters of Federal Police in Sao Paulo March 13  2015. REUTERS/Nacho Doce
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian highway police on Wednesday detained  Cesare Battisti   an Italian former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in  his  country  as  he  was attempting to cross the border into Bolivia in a taxi  federal police said.
 Battisti  was apparently trying to leave Brazil after Italy reportedly asked Brazil’s government to revoke  his  asylum status and extradite  him  to serve  his  prison sentence.
 He  was stopped by highway police as  he  was about to cross the border in a Bolivian taxi and was held for possession of a “significant” quantity of undeclared foreign currency  the federal police said in a statement.
 Battisti  faced life in prison in Italy  where  he  was convicted of four murders committed in the 1970s  when  he  belonged to a guerilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism.  He  escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited to Italy.
 Battisti ’s lawyer  Igor Sant‘Anna  told Reuters that he had sought a habeas corpus injunction last week due to the risk that President Michel Temer’s government could agree to Italy’s request. Habeas corpus is a legal procedure that keeps a government from holding a person without showing cause.","Italian former leftist guerrilla [TGT]  leaves the headquarters of Federal Police in Sao Paulo March 13  2015.

3429,Wrecked and retching: Obscure vomiting illness linked to long,Chalfonte LeNee Queen,"For 17 years   Chalfonte LeNee Queen  suffered periodic episodes of violent retching and abdominal pain that would knock  her  off  her  feet for days  sometimes leaving  her  writhing on the floor in pain.
 Queen  lost a modeling job after being mistaken for an alcoholic.  She  racked up tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills  and  her  nausea interrupted  her  sex life. Toward the end of  her  illness  Queen  who stands 5-foot-9  weighed in at a frail 109 pounds.
Throughout the nearly two decades of pain  vomiting and mental fog   she  visited the hospital about three times a year  but doctors never got to the bottom of what was ailing  her . By 2016   she  thought  she  was dying  that  she  ""must have some sort of cancer or something they can't detect ""  Queen  said.
But  she  didn't have cancer.  She  had an obscure syndrome called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome  a condition only recently acknowledged by the medical community. It affects a small population namely  a subset of marijuana users who smoke multiple times a day for months  years or even decades.
One surefire sign of the illness is when patients find relief in hot showers and baths.  Queen  said  she  would vomit repeatedly unless  she  was in a hot shower so  she 'd stay in there for hours. Toxicologists say the heat may distract the brain from pain receptors in the abdomen but  like the syndrome itself  that phenomenon is not well understood.
 Queen  is still struggling to completely quit marijuana  but  her  symptoms are down to a dull stomachache.  She  smokes a couple of times a day  compared with  her  near-constant use in the past.  She  said it's the only thing that works for  her  depression and anxiety.
 Queen  is back to a healthy weight and hasn't been to the hospital in a year.  She  said  she  wouldn't want to discourage anybody from smoking weed;  she  just wants people to know heavy use can bring them some serious misery.

3430,The Daily 202: Baseball is a salve for our national wounds,-- Donald Trump,"-- Many of my stadium visits have dovetailed with fruitful reporting trips. I watched the Reds play in Cincinnati last fall after spending an afternoon with  Trump  supporters drinking $1 beers in Middletown  Ohio. Several independent voters told me at PNC Park in Pittsburgh last September that they voted for Bill Clinton both times  but they couldn’t get behind Hillary Clinton. On election night  I flashed back to both of those experiences as I set out to explain what happened.
An expected rule by the  Trump  administration to limit the ACA's contraception coverage mandate will fulfill a crucial promise  Donald Trump  made as a candidate to appeal to social conservatives. (Photodisc)
-- The  Trump  administration is expected to announce today a major rollback of the ACA’s contraception coverage mandate. William Wan and Juliet Eilperin report: “The action … will allow a much broader group of employers and insurers to exempt themselves from covering contraceptives such as birth control pills on religious or moral grounds. It represents the latest twist in a seesawing legal and ideological fight that has surrounded this aspect of the 2010 health-care law nearly from the start. … The action by the Trump administration is almost certain to spark fresh litigation. The National Women’s Law Center — which estimates that in 2013 alone  the contraception requirement saved women $1.4 billion in oral contraceptive costs — has vowed to challenge the administration in court.”
-- Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the White House “welcomed” the NRA’s position  adding that  Trump  wants to be part of the “conversation” about cracking down on the devices.
--  Trump  is slated to announce next week that  he  will “decertify” the nuclear deal with Iran  saying it is “not in the national interest” before punting the issue to Congress. Anne Gearan and Karoun Demirjian report: “The move would mark the first step in a process that could eventually result in the resumption of U.S. sanctions against Iran … But  Trump  would hold off on recommending that Congress reimpose sanctions  which would constitute a clearer break from the pact[.] The decision would amount to a middle ground of sorts between  Trump   who has long wanted to withdraw from the agreement completely  and many congressional leaders and senior diplomatic  military and national-security advisers  who believe the deal is worth preserving with changes if possible.  Trump  is expected to deliver a speech  tentatively scheduled for Oct. 12  laying out a larger strategy for confronting the nation  he  blames for terrorism and instability throughout the Middle East. … Officials cautioned that plans could still change[.]”
-- During an event with senior military leaders last night   Trump  cryptically said  “You know what this represents. Maybe it's the calm before the storm.” Pressed by reporters on what “the storm” meant  the president would only say  “You'll find out.”
--  Trump ’s decision on the deal could cause a “major breach” with European allies. Karen DeYoung and Carol Morello report: ““After the Paris climate decision … this could push multilateralism to the breaking point ’ said a senior official from one of the three European signatories to the Iran deal. None of the three — Britain  France and Germany — believes Iran is in violation  and each has said publicly it will not renegotiate the nuclear agreement. U.S. imposition of sanctions affecting banks that even indirectly do business in Iran would doubtless influence those countries’ companies  they say  and would be considered an unfriendly act.”
-- Robert Mueller’s team met this summer with “Russia dossier” author and former MI-6 officer Christopher Steele. CNN’s Evan Perez  Shimon Prokupecz and Pamela Brown report: “The intelligence agencies  particularly the CIA  and the FBI took Steele's research seriously enough that they kept it out of a publicly-released January report on Russian meddling in the election in order to not divulge which parts of the dossier they had corroborated and how. This contrasts with attempts by [ Trump ] and some lawmakers to discredit Steele and the memos  [which they described as a ‘complete work of fiction.’]”
In addition to trying to cut funding for the ACA  the  Trump  administration also is hampering state efforts to control premiums. (Andrew Harnik/AP)
--  Trump  supporters’ low-dollar donations to the RNC have given the GOP a huge financial advantage over the Democrats and could fundamentally change the party. Matea Gold reports: “In giving to support  Trump   his backers are pouring tens of millions of dollars into the coffers of the [RNC]  which has raised more from small-dollar contributions at this point in the election cycle than the national party has collected in more than a decade. … [The RNC] has pulled in nearly twice as much as its Democratic counterpart this year. “
--  Trump  personally intervened this summer to stop GOP lawmakers in Iowa from attempting to revitalize the state’s ACA exchange. Juliet Eilperin reports: “ Trump  read about the request in a newspaper story and called the federal director weighing the application.  Trump ’s message in late August was clear[:] … Tell Iowa no. Supporters of the Affordable Care Act see the president’s opposition even to changes sought by conservative states as part of a broader campaign by his administration to undermine the 2010 health-care law.”
-- The administration plans to propose cutting legal immigration in half over the next decade in exchange for a DACA replacement. Politico’s Josh Dawsey  Andrew Restuccia and Matthew Nussbaum report: “The principles would likely be a political non-starter for Democrats and infuriate Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi[.] … [ Trump  aide Stephen Miller  who is crafting the plan ] was upset after  Trump’s  dinner last month with Schumer and Pelosi and has been working since to bring the president back to the tougher stance he took during his campaign.""
-- The administration told the Supreme Court yesterday that it should not consider  Trump ’s previous travel ban  which has now been replaced. Robert Barnes reports: “Opponents of the ban  who had persuaded two appeals courts to block the executive order  said the court should continue to review the cases. Even if not  they said  the lower-court rulings should stand. The justices asked for the new briefing about whether the issue was moot since [ Trump ] announced a replacement travel ban last month. The court canceled an oral argument on the issue scheduled for next week. … Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said the new proclamation means that temporary measures under review at the Supreme Court have been superseded.”
--  Trump  is expected to scrap the Obama-era Clean Power Plan by arguing that  his  predecessor’s proposal to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions overstepped legal boundaries. Brady Dennis reports: “In a copy of the proposed repeal  first reported by Bloomberg News  the EPA does not offer an alternative plan for regulating emissions of carbon dioxide  which the Supreme Court has ruled that the agency is obligated to do. Rather  the agency said it plans to seek public input on how best to cut emissions from natural-gas and coal-fired power plants.”
--  Trump  also plans to nominate coal lobbyist Andrew R. Wheeler  who has ties to climate change deniers  to serve as the EPA’s second-in-command. (The New York Times’s Lisa Friedman)
-- Meanwhile  the Secret Service has spent at least $137 505 on golf cart rentals to protect  Trump  this year during the time spent at  his  private clubs in New Jersey and Florida. USA Today’s Julia Fair reports: “According to federal purchase orders … the agency paid $61 960 in a Sept. 29 contract to rent golf carts at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida. That's the biggest purchase order for golf carts so far . . . The agency signed contracts for golf carts at  Trump 's clubs as early as February  but they never exceeded about $18 000.”","-- Many of my stadium visits have dovetailed with fruitful reporting trips.

3432,NFL: Vick scores two touchdowns triumphant Atlanta return,Michael Vick,"Former gridiron superstar Michael Vick scored his first touchdowns since returning to the National Football League after a jail term against his former club here on Sunday.
Vick scored on a five-yard run in the third quarter and threw a five-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter for Philadelphia in a 34-7 victory at Atlanta  drawing cheers from the same crowd that had welcomed him with boos.
""I can't be more thankful "" Vick said. ""I was overwhelmed by the crowd's reaction. I'm so glad I had a second chance. It was awesome.
Exposed details of animal cruelty by Vick - including slaying of dogs through such methods as beating  drowning and electrocution - have brought an apology and speeches to youth groups by Vick on not doing as he once did.
""My goal was to get the crowd on their feet and let them know I miss them too "" Vick said. ""I knew it would be 50-50. I totally understand.""
Hurting Falcons fans who dreamed of a first-ever Super Bowl behind Vick's run- pass skills took out their anger when he came onto the field  booing him on runs of three and four yards for Philadelphia on the Eagles' first drive.
But in his first appearance of the second half in place of Eagles starter Donovan McNabb  Vick received the ball on a direct long snap and ran up the middle  diving into the end zone for his first touchdown since last scoring for the Falcons on October 15  2006.

""It was a great feeeling to get into the end zone. It was as if time stopped on that play "" Vick said. ""When I scored that touchdown  the entire bench was halfway onto the field (to congratulate me).""
Vick connected with Brent Celek on a five-yard touchdown pass with 2:29 elapsed in the fourth quarter  completing an emotional return with the best day yet in his comeback  prompting Falcon fans to chant ""We want Vick.""
""As loud as it gets in the stadium  it sent chills down my spine "" Vick said. ""It was nice to hear that people are willing to give me a second chance.""
""I want this to be an inspiring story "" Vick said. ""Things may happen but you have to persevere  make strides week in and week out.
Former teammates greeted Vick warmly  including hugs from Todd McClure  his former center with the Falcons  and Atlanta receiver Roddy White. Vick served as a captain for the game and was on the field for the opening coin toss.
""Everybody felt it and rallied around him "" Reid said. ""Fans in general calling out his name at the end there  I'm proud of them for giving him a second chance.""
Reid said he had no special advice for Vick on how to handle the homecoming  but Vick revealed the coach had predicted Vick's two-touchdown performance.

3434,Mexico's War on Civil Rights,Felipe Calderon,"When President Barack Obama goes to Guadalajara  Mexico  this weekend  for the North American Leaders Summit  he will surely praise Mexican President Felipe Calderon  for the courage he has displayed fighting the war on drugs. The applause is well deserved. Calderon has turned the crackdown on drug traffickers into the centerpiece of his administration and has pursued organized crime with undeniable zeal. But before Obama becomes too effusive and pats CalderonCalderon  on the back for a job well done  it's important that the U.S. president remember the cost and the consequences of his counterpart's crusade.
In light of this  U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy  D-Vt.  was right this week  to call ""premature""  the U.S. State Department's draft report claiming that Mexico has fulfilled its human rights obligations under the so-called Merida Initiative. He is right to remind officials on both sides of the border that in return for Merida's   $1.4 billion in counter-narcotics aid from the United States  the Calderon government made promises it has not kept. Key among these are greater transparency and accountability  and the imperative that military officers be tried by civilian courts.
Time and again  Calderon has resisted these demands  adopting an increasingly contradictory stance. Calderon stands with his hand outstretched  asking the U.S. for more support and involvement in the war on drugs. But he also obstinately defends military exceptionalism regarding the justice system  decries U.S. intervention in Mexico's internal affairs and rallies Mexico's political class under the banner of a politically expedient anti-Americanism.
So unless the Obama administration insists that those requirements be met  the Merida Initiative will simply be financing impunity. It will heighten the climate of fear that deeper binational collaboration sought to eradicate. It will allow the Mexican military and police forces to do what they do now: arbitrarily detain people  kill innocent bystanders at army checkpoints  threaten and abuse alleged suspects  ignore due process while carrying out arrests and get away with it because Calderon believes they can and should. In his view  the ends justify the means. As he defiantly stated in a recent interview: ""The worst human rights abuses are those committed by the drug traffickers.""
Unfortunately  Calderon's stance will undermine the cause he so valiantly espouses. Military abuses that go unsanctioned are weakening public support for the war on drugs and making it difficult to construct the rule of law in a country where it functions intermittently.
Until Mexico makes real progress where human rights are concerned  the U.S. Congress should withhold future funding for the Merida Initiative. Unless Calderon agrees to place military officials who violate human rights under the jurisdiction of civilian courts  U.S. support will perpetuate the status quo.","When President Barack Obama goes to Guadalajara  Mexico  this weekend  for the North American Leaders Summit  he will surely praise [TGT]for the courage he has displayed fighting the war on drugs.

3439,Suspect pleads not guilty in US soldier ' s death,Abdulhakim Muhammad,"A prosecutor said Muhammad admitted shooting Long and another soldier ""because of what they had done to Muslims in the past.""
 An FBI-led joint terrorism task force based in the southern United States has been investigating Muhammad since he returned to the United States from Yemen  a law enforcement official said. The suspect had been arrested and jailed in Yemen at some point for using a Somali passport  the official said. The time of that arrest was not immediately clear.
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Pat Harris said no decision has been made on whether to pursue federal charges against Muhammad. ""We're consulting with a lot of people on what  if any  charges can be filed against him "" Harris said.
 Police Sgt. Cassandra Davis said Tuesday it wasn't known when Muhammad began planning the attack.
 Deputy Prosecutor Scott Duncan said Muhammad told investigators that ""he would have killed more soldiers had they been in the parking lot."" Long and Ezeagwula were targeted as they stood outside the recruiting center smoking cigarettes.
 Muhammad did not speak during the brief hearing before Judge Alice Lightle.
 John Rehrauer  spokesman for the Pulaski County jail  said the department was handling Muhammad as it does other high-profile cases.
 ""He is in some protective custody  in a higher-security unit in a cell by himself "" Rehrauer said.
 He said he didn't know of any threats against Muhammad and said jailers did not believe he was in any greater danger than previous high-profile people handled at the prison.
 A police report said Muhammad told investigators he observed two soldiers in uniform  drove up to the recruiting center and began shooting.
 ""He saw them standing there and drove up and shot them "" Lt. Terry Hastings told The Associated Press. ""That's what he said.""
 Police arrested Muhammad along a highway moments after the shootings. Police said an assault rifle and other weapons were found in his vehicle.
 In addition to the capital murder count  Muhammad is accused of committing 16 counts of a terroristic act. Thomas said most additional counts resulted from the gunfire occurring near other people.","A prosecutor said [TGT] admitted shooting Long and another soldier ""because of what they had done to Muslims in the past.""

3442,TAKING QUESTIONS BUT NOT MANY ON TIGER WOODS,Phil Mickelson,"Phil Mickelson was unequivocal -- he was not here to talk about Tiger Woods.
 As Mickelson sat down in a lounge chair in the media tent Wednesday for his first interview session since Woods's personal life began its public unraveling on Thanksgiving weekend  he offered a pre-emptive strike.
 Before he would take questions  Mickelson said  there were a few topics he wanted to address.
 ""The first is obviously Tiger "" Mickelson said. ""That's a common topic. The game of golf needs him to come back. I mean  it's important for him to come back and be a part of the sport. But right now he's got a lot more important things going on in his life. Amy and I are good friends with both Tiger and Elin."" Mickelson was referring to Woods's wife.
 life. Amy and I are good friends with both Tiger and Elin."" Mickelson was referring to Woods's wife.
 ""We care deeply about how this turns out "" Mickelson continued. ""But I'm going to choose not to talk about it publicly anymore and I appreciate your understanding on that.""
 Understanding or not  when Mickelson and the rest of the field tee off Thursday at Torrey Pines  it will be the start of a new normal for the PGA Tour. Woods  who has taken an indefinite leave of absence after reports of extramarital affairs  has taken sponsors with him and will probably take spectators and television viewers  too.
 Mickelson is the heir apparent  because of both his standing as the No. 2 golfer in the world after his strong finish to 2009 and his longstanding role as a foil to Woods. That contrast in personas was reinforced Wednesday when Mickelson said he would skip the Match Play Championship Feb. 17-21 in Tucson to take a family vacation that was postponed because of the cancer treatment schedules of his wife and mother.
 Mickelson will turn 40 this year  and his sometimes doughy midsection has noticeably firmed  something he believes will add distance and accuracy to his driver  long considered the weak link in his game.
 Mickelson's gift of charm and his ability to finesse his way around a question have clearly not been dulled. Asked if he had called or sent text messages to Woods  Mickelson said he had limited communication with the Woods family. Pressed if he had contact with Tiger  Mickelson said  ""With the family  not necessarily saying with who in the family.""
 Asked for his reaction to the news media coverage of Woods  Mickelson turned the tables on the questioner.
 ""That's what you guys do for a living "" he said. ""How do you feel it was covered? I don't know.""
 Mickelson  who beat Woods by three strokes at the Tour Championship last September  deflected questions about voids to fill. But preparing to start his season on a course he grew up playing  in a tournament he has played each of the last 20 years  Mickelson made it clear he was prepared to challenge himself.
 ""My whole career I've been trying to get to No. 1 "" Mickelson said. ""This year  whether or not Tiger is in the field  I still believe that this is an opportunity for me to compete in majors  to challenge him.

3444,LAKERS ' ASSISTANT SHAW NOTICES OLD HANDS-ON KOBE AS FINALS GOES ON,Brian Shaw,"But as the Finals have progressed  and Bryant's will has grown stronger and more determined  Lakers assistant coach Brian Shaw has noticed a pattern from the past re-emerging.
 ""We always  at the end of the evening  can find areas during the game where we say Kobe needs to move the ball more and get more people involved "" Shaw said. ""But that's something that you just kind of have to take with him. Because of his ability  he can take and make shots that most other players can't make.""
 Shaw said that over his years as an assistant  and a player alongside Bryant  he's noticed how a ""pecking order"" emerges in the Lakers offense with Bryant as the top option  and too often the only option.
 ""We tell our guys to start the offense away from him "" Shaw said.
 ""Use this side of the court  see your options over here; if nothing's there  reverse it to him and now the shot clock's down and let him do his thing. But when he's out there on the floor and he's doing his little signals asking for the ball  there's kind of a pecking order that happens out there on the court.
 ""They don't want to piss him off  and they want to please the coaching staff as well. But he's the closest one to them on the floor. So a lot of times they'll force the ball into him with three people around him instead of making the right play.""
 The only player on the Lakers who consistently does what the offense dictates is Derek Fisher  Shaw said  with too many younger players deferring to Bryant's commands.
 ""Some of the younger guys  they just want to make him happy "" Shaw said. ""When I played  Shaq was the second ... there were two dominant players. So if we went away from Kobe and threw it in to Shaq  what can he say? Now  who is that guy that's on the same level that he's on? If they make a play over here to Lamar (Odom) or somebody else and Kobe gets mad  then they're going to play more to that because nobody's on that same level.""
 Well  how about a certain 7-foot tall Spaniard? ""Pau (Gasol) doesn't have the demeanor "" Shaw said. ""He's a nice guy. Shaq might've been like  'Give me the ball.' And Kobe might've been like  'Give me the ball.' If you give it to Shaq  it's OK. If you give it to Pau and it doesn't work out  then Kobe might get on you. That's just something the players have to work out.""
 Shaw did not intend his remarks to come off as critical of Bryant  merely explanatory. It's a blessing-and-curse issue the Lakers' coaching staff has gladly dealt with for years  only sometimes finding answers.
 In the past couple of years  Shaw said  Bryant and coach Phil Jackson have developed a level of trust where Jackson is OK with Bryant calling plays on his own or deviating from what Jackson has drawn up.
 Shaw said the coaching staff can only do so much in that regard. That it's up to his teammates to be more assertive and confident in their reads and reactions to Bryant for things to evolve to the next level.
 If his teammates hang back  Bryant will push into the void. Even if he's tired. Even if he's past his limit.","But as the Finals have progressed  and Bryant's will has grown stronger and more determined  [TGT] has noticed a pattern from the past re-emerging.

 Little more than a week before he begins the defence of his Australian Open title  Nadal also let slip a 3-1 final set lead  and retreated into more defensive and containing patterns which contributed significantly to the courageous Davydenko revival.
 Australian Open title  Nadal also let slip a 3-1 final set lead  and retreated into more defensive and containing patterns which contributed significantly to the courageous Davydenko revival.
 ""Maybe I needed to be a bit more calm "" Nadal said about the second match point which got away. ""But probably that's because I have not won a tournament for so many months.""
 ""In this tournament I came back to play my best tennis for a long time "" claimed Nadal  making the best of his disappointment.
 ""Anyway I lost today (Saturday). He played unbelievable tennis - he was just better.""
 During that phase the Russian began uncertainly  Nadal imposed a flatter- hitting  earlier-taken  more enterprising attack which he had been employing previously this week  and had romped through seven games without reply.
 When Davydenko began to play more as he had against Roger Federer in the semi- finals  taking the initiative wherever possible  hitting stridently and if necessary finishing the rally in the forecourt  Nadal fought back aggressively from 3-5 down  and looked odds on to close the match out in the tie-break.
 On one of his match points  at 6-5  Davydenko played just too well  but on the second  at 8-7  Nadal earned himself a relatively pressure-free hit on the forehand from inside the baseline - and unaccountably put it into the net.
 Once he had also let slip an early break of serve in the final set  Nadal's lack of confidence  born from injury  a long sequence without a title  and doubts about his future  began to reveal itself.
 He retreated more often into what he knew best - the style in which he contains his opponent's attacks from several feet behind the baseline  relying on mobility  tenacity  and change-of-paced winners from counter-hitting positions.

3449,WHISTLE-BLOWER HOPES FOR VINDICATION ON PIPES,John Hendrix,"The whistle-blower  John Hendrix  accuses his former employer  one of the world's largest pipe manufacturers  of falsifying test results about the quality of its products. Pipes that should last 50 years are in some cases rupturing in their very first year  according to Hendrix and some state documents. This can lead to explosions  leaks  fires and other dangers.
 Hendrix said he uncovered the problem after he was asked to oversee the certification of a new manufacturing process that put the pipes through a prescribed battery of tests. He concluded that JM Eagle had been selling substandard plastic pipe since 1996  and that it had subsequently manipulated test results.
 When he told his superiors of his concerns  they said the problems were a normal ""business risk "" according to the complaint. When he pressed harder  he was fired.
 He said he believed that Hendrix had ""cherry-picked"" testing documents and e-mail messages to give the impression that the company had been not followed proper testing procedures. Some of the requirements were ambiguous  he said  and Hendrix was interpreting them so strictly ""no manufacturer could have met that standard."" Galindo said JM Eagle had worked with the relevant industrial associations to clarify the ambiguous language.
 If Hendrix's allegations are borne out  it is not clear who will pay to repair the faulty water systems.
 Hendrix said in his complaint that after Walter Wang became chief executive in 1990  many of the longtimers resigned or retired  and people who had minimal backgrounds in engineering or failure analysis replaced them.
 JM Eagle also put a premium on cutting costs  Hendrix said  hiring people like him straight out of college. It even maintained a boarding house near Livingston for Taiwanese employees who could not afford suburban New York housing on their modest salaries.
 One of his first jobs was to field customer complaints  which he said came in at the rate of at least one a day. He said he was trained to look for ways to attribute leaks and ruptures to the governments and contractors who installed and maintained the pipes.
 Only when he was assigned to oversee certain tests did Hendrix begin to think the complaints stemmed from the company's own cost-cutting measures. He said he realized JM Eagle had started buying a lower grade of raw materials from Formosa and had speeded up its production lines without reporting the changes to the certification agencies as required.
 The more he learned  he said  the harder it became for him to tell customers their problems were the result of their own errors on construction sites.","The whistle-blower  [TGT]accuses [TGT] former employer  one of the world's largest pipe manufacturers  of falsifying test results about the quality of [TGT] products.

3453,PAYBACK FOR LITTLE GUY,Philip Gordon,"Gordon has made a career of what are known as wage-and-hour cases. That may sound dry  but the issues involved strike at the heart of the relationship between employees - particularly low-income employees - and the people they work for. As Gordon explains it  this a population that is often at the mercy of the people they work for. The benefits at stake here are typically small - two hours of overtime here  a lunch break there - but they add up.
 He entered the Wal-Mart suit earlier this year. Mills Law Firm  a law firm based in California  had been appointed by the court to represent the plaintiffs. Mills is one of the nation's preeminent class-action law firms but needed local counsel. Gordon became that counsel  the lawyer on the ground in Boston.
 That the case has taken eight years to resolve speaks to the difficulty of suing a behemoth. Though Gordon was not at liberty to talk about Wal-Mart specifically  he talked generally about the difficulty of suing a big company.
 ""They have so many resources "" he said. ""If you need records  like timecards that prove how much your client worked  they have the records. If you need to talk to a manager who can explain what went on  the manager works for them. They can tie up cases  knowing that employees have no resources and need lawyers who can take cases on contingency "" meaning they get paid only if they win the case.
 Asks Gordon: ""How many lawyers can afford to do that?""
 Gordon refers to the settlement as a ""mini-stimulus"" for the affected workers  who will receive an average of $734. ""It's direct assistance - cash - to people who really  really need it.""
 He argues that the settlement will be good for low-wage workers  whose employers will be less likely to exploit them  and to employers. Law-abiding employers  he said  will no longer have to compete against companies that derive an unfair advantage by underpaying their workers.
 Gordon delivers this message  like many of his statements  with something approaching messianic zeal. He is David battling Goliath  and this case is proof that sometimes David can win.
 ""I'm a lucky guy "" he said. ""I get to do what I love to do.”","""[TGT] has made a career of what are known as wage-and-hour cases.

The benefits at stake here are typically small - two hours of overtime here  a lunch break there - but they add up.
 [TGT] entered the Wal-Mart suit earlier this year. Mills Law Firm  a law firm based in California  had been appointed by the court to represent the plaintiffs. Mills is one of the nation's preeminent class-action law firms but needed local counsel. [TGT] became that counsel  the lawyer on the ground in Boston.
 That the case has taken eight years to resolve speaks to the difficulty of suing a behemoth. Though [TGT] was not at liberty to talk about Wal-Mart specifically  [TGT] talked generally about the difficulty of suing a big company.
 ""They have so many resources "" [TGT] said. ""If you need records  like timecards that prove how much your client worked  they have the records. If you need to talk to a manager who can explain what went on  the manager works for them. They can tie up cases  knowing that employees have no resources and need lawyers who can take cases on contingency "" meaning they get paid only if they win the case.
 Asks [TGT]: ""How many lawyers can afford to do that?
 [TGT] refers to the settlement as a ""mini-stimulus"" for the affected workers  who will receive an average of $734. ""It's direct assistance - cash - to people who really  really need it.""
 He argues that the settlement will be good for low-wage workers  whose employers will be less likely to exploit them  and to employers. Law-abiding employers  he said  will no longer have to compete against companies that derive an unfair advantage by underpaying their workers.
 [TGT] delivers this message  like many of [TGT] statements  with something approaching messianic zeal. [TGT] is David battling Goliath  and this case is proof that sometimes David can win.

 ""We are not telling our forces to walk away or back up  especially if our forces are in jeopardy "" he told AFP.
 ""But in instances when our forces can make the decision to de-escalate (a situation)  they have an opportunity to more deliberately work their way through the problem "" he said.
 An example could be deciding not to attack insurgents in a building when it was not certain who was inside  Smith said.
 If they were not in immediate danger  the troops could choose to hold back and call in aerial surveillance of the area  or put in more ground forces or work with the villagers against their targets  he said.

3455,ICASUALTIES.ORG KEEPS TALLY IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN,Michael White,"Traffic on the site has dropped by at least half since the days of the surge  when the conduct of the war in Iraq was an issue in the 2008 presidential election. Now the site gets about 25 000 to 35 000 unique visitors a day  White says.
 Also  donations have dried up -- less than $1 000  far short of the costs and down from $8 000 to $10 000 in a typical year. And no more people volunteer to enter the data and free White to improve the design of the site.
 In part  White says he keeps updating the information on the site because it is a calling  an obligation he wants to see through until the war ends. Ultimately  he would like to create a more permanent record of what he has compiled  maybe even publish a book.
 There is another reason: People are counting on him -- reporters  that is.
 White says he wanted to offer the public a way to assess independently the progress of the war:
 White points to 2006 as the year when journalists felt confident enough to use iCasualties' data as their own. ""I had three years of doing it "" he said. ""I was not just somebody out there doing a blog  but I took the time to build a database  to build  I don't know what the word is  my own journalistic standards before putting it out there.""
 While White says he gets fewer calls for detailed data analysis -- deaths  say  by improvised-explosive device in a certain province of Iraq -- the site's figures are being used more routinely. A Nexis search would seem to bear this out  with more citations in last six months (842 articles) than in all of 2009 (795)  even as news coverage from Iraq and Afghanistan is declining. (The New York Times has quoted the site 82 times since 2004  including 27 times in 2010.)
 These days  White finds himself more frequently in the role of media critic. He says he is continually amazed at how little attention the war in Afghanistan has generated.
 ""We had 50 U.S. deaths in Afghanistan last month  and we are on course for 50 deaths this month  but it is not talked about "" White said. ""It is not on the nightly news."" He refers to his tables to finds months when a similar total of American troops were killed in Iraq  and it was big news.
 ""If it was in Iraq  it would be on the news "" he said.
 He concedes that he was slow to recognize the war in Afghanistan. But with the drawdown of United States troops in Iraq and the transfer of troops to Afghanistan  iCasualties' focus has shifted. ""Afghanistan was the redheaded stepchild of what I did "" White said. ""Now Iraq is.""

3456,Verdasco loses then picks a winner: It ' s Roger,Rafael Nadal,"After losing in straight sets to No. 1 Rafael Nadal on yet another semi-miserable  windblown night in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday  Verdasco walked away more impressed by the conditions -- and by Roger Federer -- than anything Nadal did.
 Nadal wasn't so bad in them either  overcoming his first dropped service game of the tournament to scrub out eighth-seeded Verdasco 7-5  6-3  6-4 in the first all-Spanish quarterfinal in U.S. Open history.
 Like Federer  Nadal has yet to lose a single set in five matches at Flushing Meadows  and handles bad conditions well.
 In advancing to his third straight U.S. Open semifinal  Nadal improved to 11-0 lifetime against Verdasco -- victories scored around the world  on almost every kind of surface and in almost every kind of weather. But when it was over  Verdasco sounded less overwhelmed by his opponent than depressed that he didn't get Nadal on a better night.
 ""For the game I need to beat Rafa  these conditions was very bad for me "" he said.
 Meanwhile  told of Verdasco's early handicapping  Nadal took no offense.
 ""Well  for sure Roger is the favorite of the tournament  especially because he's won five times "" Nadal said. ""And six finals in a row. No one doubts on that one. And I am in the semifinals  so I don't think about the final. Everybody free to think  and what Fernando says is completely fair.""
 Indeed  there is still some business to be completed before the dream final -- a pairing that has taken place at every Grand Slam final except the U.S. Open. (Nadal is 5-2 in those meetings.)
 Nadal's next opponent will be Mikhail Youzhny  who defeated Stanislas Wawrinka 3-6  7-6 (7)  3-6  6-3  6-3 in a contest Thursday afternoon that featured 128 unforced errors. Youzhny made his second U.S. Open semifinal with a performance that  frankly  he'll need to pump up if he's going to pull off an upset against the world's top player.
 Nadal was the fourth and final man to punch his ticket to the semifinals  even as he dropped serve in the first set -- the first time he was broken in the tournament following 62 consecutive holds.
 Not to worry. Five games later  Verdasco double-faulted on the last two points to give the break back  then Nadal got another one to avoid the tiebreaker and close out the set  7-5. He got a break in each of the next sets to close out what will go down as a routine victory  nothing like their epic  five-set  5-hour semifinal at the 2009 Australian Open.
 ""When I had the chance  I tried to play hard and go to the net to close the point "" Verdasco said. ""But when I had these balls  the ball was moving all the time and it was impossible to play the game that I think I need to try to have chances to beat Rafa.""
 After his win over Robin Soderling on Wednesday  Federer said he liked playing in wind because of the challenge it provides.
 ""The movements must be all the time high intensity and the concentration must be all the time full "" he said.

3457,Argentina bank chief refuses president's demand to resign,Christina Kirchner,"Argentina's central bank chief refused to resign after President Christina Kirchner demanded on Wednesday that he step down  in a growing row over payments of debt.
 Martin Redrado had declined to hand over 6.5 billion dollars of Argentina's foreign currency reserves to pay off national debt  after the president ordered him to do so three weeks ago.
 Kirchner announced the call for Redrado's resignation on her official website early Wednesday.
 ""They have asked him to step down. He responded that he will not quit "" a central bank official said  adding that the government would have to apply the ""appropriate mechanism"" to remove Redrado.
 However  Kirchner's control over Congress has weakened since mid-term elections last year.
 Kirchner in December signed a presidential decree ordering the transfer of 6.5 billion dollars from central bank reserves to a new fund  known as the Bicentennial Fund  to guarantee debt payments in 2010 and free up cash for other spending.
 Kirchner said in December that she wanted to guarantee the debt payment in an effort to help Argentina end its isolation from global credit markets.

 Alex Ovechkin is hitting his stride just ahead of the Vancouver Olympics.
 The 24-year-old Russian is one of the few players in the National Hockey League who can bring fans out of their seats with his end-to-end rushes.
 He is also a student of the game and has the skill and charisma that hockey purists like. But he has also been accused of being a dirty player who lets others fight his battles for him.
 ""Ovechkin may be the villain in hockey circles  but the kids eat him up. They think he is sick "" said Canadian television analyst and former NHL goaltender Greg Millen.
Ovechkin may be the villain in hockey circles  but the kids eat him up. They think he is sick "" said Canadian television analyst and former NHL goaltender Greg Millen.
 Ovechkin was named the NHL's player-of-the week last week  scoring 10 points in four games.

3462,Interview: Fundamentals crucial to building ideal city: Singapore city planner,Liu Thai-Ker,"Having just wrapped up a visit to China on the eve of the Shanghai World Expo's opening  Liu shared his views on urban planning and what an ideal city is about.
 The 72-year-old Liu was an architect-planner and chief executive of Singapore's Housing and Development Board and chief planner and chief executive of Urban Redevelopment Authority. He is currently the director of RSP Architects Planners
 For Liu  fundamentals are  first and foremost  the pre- requisite to building a modern ideal city. Aesthetic architecture  on the other hand  is a feather on the cap  and one should not place the bull before the cart.
 Liu said ""An ideal city should have a pleasant environment  smooth traffic  pollution free and be an ideal dwelling where the people own their own houses. These are the fundamentals that must be put in place. Other distinguishing buildings such as sports stadiums  integrated resorts belong to the class of sexy things."" Liu added that while residents are interested in ""sexy"" things  and the government will hold them up as a scorecard for political credits  the basic things are what the people will experience daily.
 Taking Singapore as an example  Liu said that in the first 20 years of nation building for Singapore  it was through sheer grit  with the aim of building up an infrastructure. In the early days  foreign experts commented that Singapore is as boring as a hospital. ""I told my colleagues not to listen to them!"" Liu reminisced  ""Our city is not Disneyland  we will continue with our own way  and they will regret what they say.""
 He said that people who visit Singapore these days say that the city is beautiful and that the architecture is full of characteristics. This is not true. ""Buildings with high creative value are few and far between in Singapore. They are only good in the matter of planning and design requirements.""
 ""I tell my Chinese friends  to be good in urban planning  fundamentals are crucial. If this is lacking  sexiness is superficial. For China  tidiness is a characteristic. If every house has its own characteristic  it will become a mess "" Liu said.
 For Liu  he felt that many modern cities are getting bigger in scale and the buildings are taller. Big cities need to build skyscrapers mainly because the cities are big  the land tension is great and prices are high. This is necessary in order to meet the need of residents' housing and employment requirement. But the problem arises when a city starts building sky-high buildings regardless of the size of the city.
 Liu believed that every city has its own identity. He likens a big city to a tycoon  a mid-tier city a professor  and a small city a village girl. For the different identities  different personalities must be portrayed and hence  different strokes applied to city planning.
 Liu Thai-Ker said that Shanghai builds tall buildings due to many pressures. But a small city should make a Shanghainese envious  exuding a carefree  relaxed and romantic environment and feel.
 He said that there can be three major types of characteristics to a city: natural environment  historical monuments and modern buildings. ""Modern buildings are faceless  their structures globalized  materials globalized  and it is hard to break out of the globalized confines no matter what one does. To focus the local flavor on modern buildings is to be devoid of characteristics."" He felt that some old dilapidated traditional architecture in China should be accorded their deserving respect as they represent the true cultural essence.
 Liu Thai-Ker emphasized that developing the economy and improving the environment are not mutually exclusive. Using the Singapore experience as an illustration  he said that protecting the natural environment will not impede economic development. When the environment improves  many people would willingly stay here  which in turn generate many employment opportunities  thereby fostering economic development.
 ""(Environmental conservation) is a task that can be done  and it is a worthwhile effort!"" he claimed.
 Besides  he felt that while advancing the development of cities  China must at the same time pay attention to the environmental development of the towns and villages. After all  the local flavor can only be found in the towns and villages.","Having just wrapped up a visit to China on the eve of the Shanghai World Expo's opening  [TGT] shared [TGT] views on urban planning and what an ideal city is about.

 ""We will stand by what we always said: There will be millions of affordable tickets available to the British public "" Deighton said in a conference call. ""Our commitment is to have our venues packed to the rafters with sports fans.""
 Most international tickets will be allocated through individual national Olympic committees. Deighton said national committees will put in their applications next autumn  with tickets also going on sale in those countries in the spring of 2011.
 ""We expect the vast majority of the tickets in the ballot will stay in the U.K.  with people abroad going through their national Olympic committees "" Deighton said.
 Deighton said fewer than 1 percent of the tickets will go to ""prestige hospitality"" customers.
 LOCOG  which has a private operating budget of 2 billion pounds ($3 billion)  has forecast raising 376 million pounds ($565 million) from ticket sales. But Deighton said he considers that figure on the ""lower end"" and expects to surpass that total.
 Extra tickets have been freed up due to modifications at some venues and planned changes in some competition schedules. Beach volleyball  which had single sessions lasting up to five hours at the 2008 Beijing Olympics  will be broken into more and shorter sessions in London  Deighton said.

Asked how he would adjust  Towler responded: ""Just take a deep breath and just enjoy life right now.""
 He deflected a question about demanding an apology and said he understood justice can take time.
 ""I think it was just a process  you know  the DNA "" he said. ""It just took a couple of years to get to it. We finally got to it and the job was done.""
 Towler smiled lightly  nodded and kept his intertwined fingers on his lap.
 ""You're free "" the judge said  leaving the bench to shake Towler's hand at the defense table. The judge choked back tears as she offered Towler a traditional Irish blessing.
 Towler had been serving a life sentence for the rape of a girl in a Cleveland park in 1981. Prosecutors received the test results Monday and immediately asked the court to free him.
 The Ohio Innocence Project  an organization that uses DNA evidence to clear people wrongfully convicted of crimes  said Towler was among the longest incarcerated people to be exonerated by DNA in U.S. history. The longest was a man freed in Florida in December after serving 35 years  according to the project.
 Attorneys with the project at the University of Cincinnati have been working on the Towler case since 2004  and Towler said that and his faith had given him hope.

3465,Hugh Hefner : How Playboy grew out of his puritanical childhood,Hugh Hefner,"The Washington Post's Margaret Sullivan discusses the legacy of  Playboy founder Hugh Hefner . (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)
Hugh Hefner  who died Wednesday at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles after spending most of  his  life there in a silk robe  grew up in the 1920s on a quiet Chicago street lit with gas lamps. Horse-drawn wagons delivered milk and ice. Trains whistled in the distance.
“One of the loveliest sounds in the world ”  Hefner  said decades later.
It was there  during the Great Depression  that  Hefner ’s extraordinary life took shape — not so much because of what happened there  but what didn’t: Affection. Emotion. Love. And certainly not sex  although his parents did manage to have two children.
The rules of the home were strict — no swearing  no drinking  no playing cards  no radio on Sundays — and reflected the Puritan upbringing of  Hefner ’s parents  who grew up on Nebraska farms. His father  Glenn  was an accountant at an aluminum company. His mother  Grace  was a school teacher.
Grace was sexually demure to a degree notable even for that time  Gay Talese wrote in “Thy Neighbor’s Wife ” his bestselling book about sex in America  which chronicled  Hefner ’s rise. As for Glenn  he was “a remote  repressed man who seldom revealed his feelings to his family and spent most of his time working quietly… six days a week  sometimes seven.”
 Hefner  was “unattractive and shy ” Talese wrote  and he often slipped away from the present even though he was right there:
If the boys became restless indoors  they were permitted to sit at the workbench in the backyard where they could draw pictures or sculpt with the colored clay that  she  provided.  Hugh Hefner   who was facile in drawing and sculpturing  was more than diverted by these activities—he often seemed entranced by the clay figures of his creation  relating to  them  with a special intimacy  and if at such times his mother called to him from the back door  he would not hear her.
Though  Hefner  was bright he did not excel in school  often sitting at his desk and drawing cartoons for hours.  Hefner  seemed so totally disengaged that teachers wondered if he could hear them. Not knowing what to do  Grace had him examined by child psychologists at the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research.

Following a series of tests they concluded that his problems were rather special.  Hugh Hefner  was a genius.  His  I.Q. was 152. But  the doctors added   he  was emotionally deficient  was socially immature for  his  age  and they suggested that it might help if  Mrs. Hefner  displayed more warmth around the house  more love and sympathetic understanding.
The pinups were the highly stylized drawings by Alberto Vargas and George Petty that appeared in Esquire  which in the 1940s was published in Chicago and was the most risqué men’s magazine in America. Hugh Hefner had first seen Esquire while visiting the home of an elementary school classmate whose father  a commercial artist  subscribed to the magazine. Everything in Esquire excited young Hefner—the romantic and adventurous stories by such writers as Fitzgerald and Hemingway  the photographs of classic cars  the sophisticated cartoons  the travel articles about glamorous places  the fashion layouts  and the foldout that each month offered an exquisite color drawing of a beautiful woman. Hefner was able to decorate his room with such voluptuaries  with his mother’s acquiescence if not approval  because his schoolwork had suddenly improved and he also now seemed determined to pursue certain vaguely artistic goals that his mother was reluctant to discourage.
In the coming years   Hef  entered the Army  then college  still drawing  with  his  pictures becoming more pornographic.  He  took a series of low-level magazine jobs and then  in 1953  published the first issue of Playboy.
Talese writes: “ He  virtually lived within the glossy pages  slept in a small bedroom behind  his  office  and worked all hours of the day and night on Playboy’s color and design  the cartoons and captions  the fact and fiction.”

3466,John Fox 's 'emotional' message to Bears players 'definitely hard to watch',John Fox,"Bears players read reports for weeks that said coach John Fox’s job was in jeopardy  so it wasn’t a surprise when  Fox  delivered the news  he  had been fired Monday morning at Halas Hall.
But the forewarning didn’t take away from the emotion of the announcement as  he  said goodbye to the players  a departure that was confirmed on Twitter as some were driving to Lake Forest to clear out their lockers for the offseason.  Fox  reiterated the message  he  delivered to  his  team after Sunday’s season-ending loss to the Vikings — that  he  still would be there for players who needed  him .
Bears linebacker Nick Kwiatkoski said it was “definitely a rough situation and it’s definitely hard to watch ” and linebacker Leonard Floyd said “everybody was sad.” Those statements were in line with the prevailing sentiment that  Fox  didn’t lose the locker room despite a 5-11 season.
Bears general manager Ryan Pace said he never considered making a coaching change midseason  even as the Bears lost five straight games from Oct. 29-Dec. 3. But on Sunday   Fox  wrapped up  his  three seasons with the Bears with a 14-34 record — a .292 winning percentage that is second-worst in franchise history. That included going 0-6 in the NFC North this season and 3-15 in the division over three years. Pace said those results simply weren’t good enough.

3469,Mike Maccagnan has one Jets mission this offseason,Bryce Petty,"see also  Bryce Petty  is exactly what Jets feared  he  was NEW ORLEANS — You want so badly to root for...
3.  Bryce Petty  played better than I expected  him  to against the Saints.  He  made a few nice throws  and the moment did not look too big for  him . That being said  no one could walk away from that game thinking  Petty  is the long-term answer at quarterback.
What is interesting to  me  about  Petty  is  he  looks more comfortable when plays break down.  He  has poise and can usually make a throw when things don’t go as planned. But when you ask  him  to make a timing throw  the ball is high or low or behind the receiver. When things stay “on schedule ”  Petty  struggles.
That being said  I think offensive coordinator John Morton was too conservative with  Petty . He is a skilled deep passer. I think the Jets need to let him throw it downfield more and take advantage of his ability to make plays with his arm instead of relying on him to make good reads and accurate short throws. It will be interesting to see what adjustments the Jets make in his second start  next week against the Chargers.","see also  [TGT]is exactly what Jets feared  [TGT]  was NEW ORLEANS — You want so badly to root for...

Benjamin Netanyahu  will pass a political landmark to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister  if  he  stays in office beyond September this year.
For years  Benjamin Netanyahu has portrayed himself as the person who can best keep Israel safe in the ""tough neighbourhood"" of the Middle East.
At the age of 18   Benjamin Netanyahu  returned to Israel  where  he  spent five distinguished years in the army  serving as a captain in an elite commando unit  the Sayeret Matkal.  He  took part in a raid on Beirut's airport in 1968 and fought in the 1973 Middle East war.
After  his  military service ended   Mr Netanyahu  went back to the US  where  he  earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Politically  Benjamin Netanyahu positioned himself to the right of previous leaders of the Likud party. After Likud lost the 1992 general election  he became party chairman.","""Image copyright  EPA

3471,Al Franken's SNL colleagues' damaging letter,Al Franken,"According to a CNN report filed on Nov. 20  a second woman has accused  Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn .) of inappropriate touching  this time after  he  joined the Senate. (Joyce Koh/The Washington Post)
Well   he  didn’t do anything to me.
That  in so many words  is what three dozen women who worked on “Saturday Night Live” said in a letter supporting Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) on Tuesday.
“What  Al  did was stupid and foolish  and we think it was appropriate for  him  to apologize to Ms Tweeden  and to the public ” the women wrote. And later  “We would like to acknowledge that not one of us ever experienced any inappropriate behavior; and mention our sincere appreciation that  he  treated each of us with the utmost respect and regard.”
Good  I guess?  Franken  has been accused of unwanted sexual contact by two women  including radio host Leeann Tweeden  but apparently  he  refrained from groping at least 36. Though this character testimony may at first seem relevant to any accounting of  Franken ’s misdeeds  look closer and it’s not the least bit helpful.
It’s unclear what the letter seeks to prove. (The writers  at least  acknowledge that  Franken  mistreated Tweeden.) The number of women a man didn’t assault does not matter if there are others he did. There are plenty of people the Zodiac Killer did not murder.
Saturday Night Live briefly criticizes  Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn .)  a former writer and star of the show on Nov. 18  as he faces sexual misconduct allegations. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)
Refocusing attention on what  Franken  did right just distracts from what  he  did wrong. It also assumes a harasser abusing everyone  he  comes into contact with is the norm. That paints an inaccurate picture of workplace harassment  and it lowers the bar for behavior by suggesting that a bad man isn’t so bad after all if he’s only bad to some people.
“Sincere appreciation”? “Gratitude”? The letter-writers are thanking  Franken  for not groping them  instead of insisting that women should be able to take a grope-free atmosphere for granted.
The  Franken  letter isn’t the first time we’ve seen women speak up not to support women but to stand behind a man accused of harming women. Lena Dunham got hit hard over the weekend after she and a “Girls” co-writer mounted a similar defense of one of their colleagues accused of assault.
Dunham’s defense was worse; she claimed the accusation against her friend was “one of the 3 percent of assault cases that are misreported every year.” But she based that claim on “having worked closely with him for more than a decade.” Dunham  in other words  thought her friend was a good guy  just as  Franken ’s defenders from “SNL” see  him  as “a devoted and dedicated family man” and “an honorable public servant.”","According to a CNN report filed on Nov. 20  a second woman has accused  Sen.

3472,Chicago cop who killed 2 charged with misdemeanors for December bar fight,Robert Rialmo,"A Chicago police officer who faces potential firing for fatally shooting two people in 2015  has been charged with misdemeanor offenses following an off-duty bar fight last month.
 Officer Robert Rialmo  turned  himself  in to a police station Monday and was arrested on two counts of battery and one count of theft  all misdemeanors  said Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.  He  was released on  his  own recognizance  department officials said.
 Rialmo  is alleged to have punched two men in the face  knocking them to the floor  about 2:45 a.m. Dec. 17 at Moretti's Ristorante & Pizzeria on the Far Northwest Side  according to police reports and Guglielmi. By the time police arrived at the scene   Rialmo  was gone  the spokesman said.
 Rialmo’s  lawyer  Joel Brodsky  said video of the altercation — which has yet to be made public — shows that the officer was defending himself against “highly intoxicated aggressors.” Brodsky also denied  Rialmo  stole the jacket.
Top department officials stripped  Rialmo  of his police powers days after the bar incident.
At the time of the alleged fight   Rialmo  was already on paid desk duty pending an investigation into his fatal shooting of Quintonio LeGrier  19  and bystander Bettie Jones  55  the day after Christmas 2015 on the West Side. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability ruled five days after the tavern incident that the shooting was unjustified.
LeGrier came at  Rialmo  and his partner with an aluminum baseball bat in his hand as the officers responded to a call of a domestic disturbance.  Rialmo  shot the teen and accidentally hit Jones  a neighbor standing nearby.
But COPA voiced skepticism about  Rialmo ’s account of the confrontation  determining that the teen likely was further from  Rialmo  when he opened fire than the officer had said. Investigators also concluded that LeGrier likely did not swing the bat at  the Rialmo   as the officer had contended.
COPA recommended that  Rialmo  be fired for the shooting  but Superintendent Eddie Johnson still has months to decide what  if any  discipline he might seek from the Chicago Police Board.
Brodsky and police union officials have decried the ruling and vowed to challenge it. The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police has accused COPA of using the alleged bar fight to pressure Johnson to seek  Rialmo ’s firing in the shooting.
Jones  who lived downstairs  answered the door and pointed police to the second floor. LeGrier then came down the stairs with a bat  according to an analysis released by Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office  which declined to bring criminal charges against  Rialmo  last February.
The officers moved toward the front landing as LeGrier came at them with the bat  prosecutors wrote. As  Rialmo  backed down the stairs  he fired eight times  hitting LeGrier six times  according to prosecutors. Jones  who was standing behind the teen  was shot once in the chest.
Brodsky has said his client was justified in firing in self-defense  but COPA investigators voiced doubts about  Rialmo 's accounts. COPA found that no one corroborated the officer's contention that LeGrier swung the bat  while investigators concluded that the evidence suggested that  Rialmo  was several feet farther from the teen when  he  opened fire than the officer had said.
The survivors of both LeGrier and Jones sued  Rialmo  and the city.  Rialmo   meanwhile  took the unusual step of suing the city  alleging in part that he was inadequately trained.  Rialmo  is also suing LeGrier's estate  blaming the teen for the shooting and contending it emotionally traumatized the officer.","A Chicago police officer who faces potential firing for fatally shooting two people in 2015  has been charged with misdemeanor offenses following an off-duty bar fight last month.

3473,A massive short squeeze in Shake Shack is sending shares soaring,Matt Maley,"Shares of the burger chain have soared more than 35 percent in the last three months. Despite the rally  it's still one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market. According to FactSet data  Shake Shack short interest comes in at 48 percent of its float  and that leaves Miller Tabak technician  Matt Maley  warning against its sizzling hot run.
""The stock did break above double top levels to 2017 highs of $40 ""  Maley  said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""A lot of that fuel has been short covering  I think it's going to pull back from here.""
In other words  Shake Shack's rally is unsustainable  according to the technical analyst. Additionally   Maley  points out that the stock is extremely overbought at current levels. When investors short stocks  they are betting that shares will fall. But when shares rise  those investors are often forced to cover their short bets  and that can send a stock soaring.
However   Maley  also emphasizes that the stock's break above $40  which happened late November  is overall positive on an intermediate-term basis. ""If you do want to  buy it  but I would buy it on weakness rather than chase it up at these levels "" he cautioned.","Shares of the burger chain have soared more than 35 percent in the last three months.

3474,Battle Over Contested Virginia House Of Delegates Seat Will Drag On,David Yancey,"On the eve of the original name-drawing Wednesday  Democratic candidate Shelly Simonds filed  a court motion contesting a previous decision to count a contested ballot for her opponent  Republican incumbent David Yancey .
 The court  has yet to address the matter  as some of  its  judges are out of town for the holidays.
The turmoil over the seat has dragged on for more than a month. A recount originally proclaimed Simonds the winner by a mere one vote.  Yancey  then won a lawsuit that allowed a previously uncounted ballot to be counted as marked for  him  ― bringing the race to a tie.
Virginia House Democrats have called  Yancey ’s lawsuit a “desperate effort to change the outcome and steal the election” from Simonds.
“The court erred both in admitting the ballot for consideration  which broke the rules of the citizen-led recount process  as well as in counting the ballot for  Yancey   which  according to guidelines from the State Board of Elections  had already been accurately classified as an overvote by both the Democratic and the Republican observers ” House Democratic Caucus spokesperson Katie Baker said in a statement Friday.","On the eve of the original name-drawing Wednesday  Democratic candidate Shelly Simonds filed  a court motion contesting a previous decision to count a contested ballot for her opponent  Republican incumbent [TGT] .

3476,Chinese rights lawyer jailed two years for inciting subversion,Jiang Tianyong,"FILE PHOTO: Pro-democracy demonstrators hold up portraits of  Chinese disbarred lawyer Jiang Tianyong   demanding  his  release  during a demonstration outside the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong  China December 23  2016. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu
In a verdict posted on its official Weibo microblog on Tuesday morning  the Changsha Intermediate People’s Court said the lawyer   Jiang  Tianyong  developed notions of overthrowing China’s political system after being influenced by training workshops held by “anti-China foreign forces” overseas.
The court said  Jiang   46  used social media to “attack or defame” Chinese government departments and incited others to gather and demonstrate in public.
 Jiang ’s wife  Jin Bianling  who lives in the United States  told Reuters on Tuesday that the verdict was “unacceptable” and that she believed her husband was being made an example to “deter or repress” other rights lawyers.
“I do not acknowledge or accept this verdict ” she said in a telephone interview. “Jiang Tianyong is innocent”.
The verdict was handed down exactly one year after  Jiang  first disappeared last November while visiting the family of another detained rights lawyer.  He  was held incommunicado for six months before being formally charged.
The facts in the court’s ruling were broadly similar to those in a confession made by  Jiang  during  his  trial in August. Video footage of  Jiang  reading parts of a written statement were released by the court via social media at the time.
But rights groups said the trial was a show trial designed to discredit  him  and that  Jiang  was caught up in a sweeping campaign directed against lawyers and activists.
Jin said  Jiang ’s family was unable to appoint their own lawyers and that she had not been able to contact  Jiang  since  his  detention.
“We don’t know what  his  conditions are inside  or what kind of torture of mistreatment  he  has suffered ” she said.","FILE PHOTO: Pro-democracy demonstrators hold up portraits of [TGT]demanding  [TGT]  release  during a demonstration outside the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong  China December 23  2016.

3477,Emanuel outlines Chicago hurricane aid for Puerto Rico,Emanuel,"Chicago firefighters and paramedics are heading to Puerto Rico this week to help residents there recover from Hurricane Maria  and  Mayor Rahm Emanuel  said the city will try to organize to accept families forced to leave the island for an extended time.
Joined by  U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez  D-Chicago  Emanuel  sought to draw a distinction Monday between the city’s effort to assist Puerto Rico and what  the mayor  called the “totally inadequate” response from President Donald Trump’s administration.
“What the federal government did in the last six days  I think you know the conclusion  is inadequate  and I’m being gentle in my criticism of it ”  Emanuel  said at a City Hall news conference. “Totally inadequate on a human level. Totally inadequate that somehow these are not citizens of the United States of America.”
 He  said around 1 600 people have already arrived in the city on flights from the island since the hurricane struck Sept. 20. The mayor gave few specifics about how Chicago will prepare to accept people from Puerto Rico.
 He  said  he  wants “a structure in place” to prepare for many more to come and perhaps stay for an extended period.  Emanuel  cited as a model the way many citizens of New Orleans relocated to Houston after Hurricane Katrina.
“How do we take this from an individual basis to make it the city of big shoulders  we’re organized to do this in an organized fashion?”  he  said.
“I can either take my energy and criticize (the federal government) for their inadequacy  or take my energy and time and focus on getting ourselves organized so people know that if they have loved ones they can bring them  the kids can get in school ” Emanuel said. “They can get the health care they need. They can get an apartment they need or housing they need  a roof over their head. Again  I want to say  as many tomorrows as it takes.”","Chicago firefighters and paramedics are heading to Puerto Rico this week to help residents there recover from Hurricane Maria  and  [TGT]said the city will try to organize to accept families forced to leave the island for an extended time.

3481,Fox renewed Bill O'Reilly 's contract after he settled a $32 million sexual harassment claim,Bill O'Reilly,"Former Fox News primetime host  Bill O'Reilly  settled a sexual harassment claim in January for a record $32 million.
One month later  Fox News' parent company  21st Century Fox  renewed  O'Reilly 's contract  giving  him  a four-year deal with a $25 million annual salary.
21st Century Fox executive Rupert Murdoch and his sons decided to stand by  O'Reilly  despite the mounting allegations against  him .
 Former Fox News headliner Bill O'Reilly  settled a new sexual harassment claim for a record $32 million in January  The New York Times reported on Saturday.
One month after  O'Reilly  settled the claim — which was at least the sixth agreement that had been reached relating to  O'Reilly 's sexual misconduct — Fox News' parent company  21st Century Fox  renewed the host's contract with the network and agreed to a four-year deal with a $25 million annual salary.
 The company  said in a statement that  it  was not aware of the amount of  O'Reilly 's settlement with Wiehl and saw the dispute as a personal issue between the two.
According to the Times  21st Century Fox executives Rupert Murdoch and his sons  James and Lachlan  decided to back up  O'Reilly  in January despite the mounting allegations against  him . That decision hinged on two factors: limiting the negative publicity that a second sexual harassment scandal — coming as the network grappled with fallout from the allegations against former chairman Roger Ailes — would bring  and Megyn Kelly's announcement that she would be leaving the network after signing a multi-year contract with NBC.
 O'Reilly 's $32 million agreement with Wiehl is the largest known amount paid out to settle a sexual misconduct claim at Fox News  according to the Times. The closest figure to that amount is the $20 million former host Gretchen Carlson received when she accused Ailes of sexual harassment in 2016.
 O'Reilly 's lawyer disputed Wiehl's characterization of their relationship and said the host's relationship with the network analyst was an 18-year friendship during which she sometimes gave him legal counsel.
Mark Fabiani   O'Reilly 's spokesman  said regarding Wiehl's allegations of a nonconsensual sexual relationship that 21st Century Fox was ""well aware"" Wiehl had signed an affidavit ""renouncing all allegations"" against  O'Reilly  and that after the agreement was reached  Fox News offered  O'Reilly  ""a record breaking contract "" per The Times.
 O'Reilly  told the Times on Wednesday that none of the allegations against him held any merit. ""I never mistreated anyone ""  O'Reilly  said  and reiterated that  he  had reached settlements with  his  accusers because  he  wanted to shield  his  children from the repercussions and publicity surrounding the issue.
""It's politically and financially motivated ""  O'Reilly  told the Times  referring to the backlash that followed after the initial allegations against  him  were made public in April. ""We can prove it with shocking information  but I'm not going to sit here in a courtroom for a year and a half and let my kids get beaten up every single day of their lives by a tabloid press that would sit there  and you know it ""  he  said.
 O'Reilly  was ultimately ousted from the network in April  following an exodus of advertisers from  his  show's time slot. Earlier that month  the Times published an investigation that found that  O'Reilly  and Fox News had paid out $13 million to five women to settle sexual-harassment claims they had brought against  him .
Multiple other women accused  O'Reilly  of sexual harassment after the report was published. Shortly before  O'Reilly  was booted  an unnamed black woman said through her attorney  Lisa Bloom  that  O'Reilly  leered at her and called her ""hot chocolate"" in 2008. Bloom is also representing Wendy Walsh  a former Fox News contributor who has said that  O'Reilly  reneged on an offer of employment after  she  rebuffed  his  advances and declined an invitation to  his  hotel suite in 2013.

Minnesota’s governor announced his intention to appoint Lt. Gov. Tina F. Smith  his former chief of staff  to fill the seat expected to be vacated by  Sen. Al Franken  — and she plans to run for election in November to finish out the term.
[ Franken  announces  he  will resign from the Senate as harassment issue rocks Congress]
Franken  who has faced multiple allegations of sexual harassment  announced last week that  he  would resign  his  office “in the coming weeks ” but has not set a date. Smith said she expected to take office in “early January.”
Schumer declined to answer questions about  Franken ’s departure date or Smith on Wednesday morning  saying  he  would leave it to Dayton to make the announcement. Dayton said he had not received any written notice of  Franken ’s resignation. “ Sen. Franken  is a man of  his  word ” Dayton said. “I fully expect that  he  will follow through and resign.”
 Franken  has apologized for  his  behavior  while contesting the particulars of some women’s claims against  him . “Some of the allegations against  me  are simply not true. Others I remember very differently ”  Franken  said  when  he  announced  his  resignation  under intense pressure from  his  Democratic colleagues.
Republicans are likely to mount a serious challenge for  Franken ’s Senate seat  which was previously held by Republican Norm Coleman. One possible candidate  floated by Senate Republicans  is former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty  who unsuccessfully sought the 2012 GOP nomination for president and now serves as president of the Financial Services Roundtable.","Minnesota Lt.

3483,FCC chairman blasts net neutrality activists 'harassing us' at home,Ajit Pai,"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  on Monday blasted net neutrality activists who protested outside his home with signs directed at his children  saying the demonstration “crosses a line.”
The protests followed  Pai  saying last week that  he  would follow through on  his  pledge to repeal Obama-era Internet regulations.
The move set up a showdown with consumer groups  but the backlash recently reached  Pai 's own home -- with activists putting up cardboard signs that ask if this is the world  he  wants  his  children to ""inherit."" One sign says  ""They will come to know the truth. Dad murdered democracy in cold blood.""
“It certainly crosses a line with me ”  Pai  told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” on Monday. “Families … should remain out of it and stop harassing us at our homes. ... It was a little nerve-racking  especially for my wife who’s not involved in this space.”
But  Pai  argues the rules discourage the ISPs from making investments in their network that would provide even better and faster online access.
 He  also said Monday that  he  thinks the five-member Federal Communications Commission will vote 3-2 in favor of repealing the regulations. The vote is scheduled for Dec. 14.
“The solution is not more regulations ”  he  said. “The problem was this was slapping on more regulations.”
 Pai  has reportedly distributed  his  alternative plan to other commissioners.
Fellow Commissioner Mignon L.

3484,Naperville family starts foundation in memory of son who killed himself after school discipline,Corey,"But the details surrounding  Corey Walgren’s  suicide in early 2017 were so startling and so disturbing   his  parents felt compelled to do more.  Corey —  who had never been in trouble or shown any suicidal tendencies — killed  himself  after being questioned about a disciplinary matter by authorities at school  and  his  parents believe the tragedy was entirely preventable.
 They  decided if  they  wanted to truly honor  Corey ’s life   they  needed to do something that would educate students about  their  rights  warn parents about potential risks and remind educators about their responsibilities.
To achieve that goal   they  recently launched  Corey ’s Goal  a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising awareness of the constitutional rights of minors in school settings and providing education on how disciplinary practices in schools can better support the emotional well-being of students.  They  plan speaking engagements and a website filled with information on the topic to help spread  their  message.
“We need to start telling people that this could happen in their schools ” Maureen Walgren said. “We need to get this information in front of  them  and hopefully influence change.”
 Corey  a junior at Naperville North High School   was summoned to administrative offices Jan. 11  2017  to meet with Dean Stephen Madden and Naperville police Officer Brett Heun  who is assigned to the campus. The two questioned  Corey  about an allegation that  he  had a video of a consensual sexual encounter with a female classmate on  his  phone and that  he  had played the recording for friends.
Heun and Madden accused  Corey  of possessing child pornography and threatened  him  with placement on the state's sex offender registry  according to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by the Walgren family.
Heun and Madden spoke with  Corey  for 18 minutes  according to police reports  before calling  his  parents. Once they reached Maureen Walgren  Heun talked to her on a speakerphone with  Corey  in the room.  He  told her that her son was being investigated for ""child pornography"" and could end up being placed on the sex offender registry  Maureen Walgren has said.
 The officer  then told Maureen Walgren  he  intended to download items from  Corey 's phone and needed her consent  according to the reports. Walgren  a nurse  said she would leave work immediately and be at the school within 50 minutes.
After the phone call ended   the officer  and the dean walked  Corey  to an office waiting area and told  him  to sit down. The two then went to speak with the school’s principal  leaving  Corey  to wait for  his  mother.
Left by  himself    Corey  walked out of the school a few minutes later and headed toward a downtown Naperville parking garage.  He  climbed to the fifth floor and then ended  his  life by plummeting 53 feet to the ground.
 His  mother  who had arrived at the school to find  Corey  missing  was in  her  car just a few blocks away searching for  Corey  when  he  fell.

Despite the allegations of child pornography  police never intended to pursue charges  records show. Rather  police reports indicated authorities wanted to handle the matter in a way that ensured  Corey  understood the seriousness of  his  actions and how it affected  his  classmate.
The Naperville Police Department and Naperville Unit District 203 have described  Corey ’s death as a tragedy  but both say that proper procedures were followed that day.

3485,Senate Report: Obamacare and Medicaid Expansion Contributed to the Opioid Epidemic,Obamacare,"The Senate Homeland Security Committee released  a report in mid-January that received surprisingly little media attention despite its provocative assertion that Obamacare  and particularly its enormous expansion of Medicaid  is a driving force behind the opioid epidemic .
The case laid out by  the report  is straightforward  logical  and politically unspeakable. It’s an argument generally made in hushed tones until now  and it’s easy to see why.

Journalist Ann Curry's parents met in Japan after World War II.  Her  American father was stationed there  and  her  mother was Japanese. But when  her  father asked the military for permission to marry  the military refused — at the time  servicemen weren't allowed to marry Japanese women.

Her father was quickly reassigned  and two years went by before  Curry 's parents reunited. Even then things weren't easy — her mother contracted tuberculosis  her grandmother disapproved. But the pair managed to defeat the odds and start a family in the U.S.
Now   Curry  has a PBS series in which  she  highlights reunions like that of  her  parents. We'll Meet Again looks at people who have had brief  meaningful first encounters but have lost touch over the years. It tells the story of a woman who was rescued by a helicopter pilot after a volcanic eruption  the story of a man who was comforted by a stranger after the Sept. 11 attacks  and more.
 Curry  has worked in journalism for 40 years  and  she  spent 15 of those years working for NBC's Today show. In 2012   she  was forced out of  her  co-anchor post opposite Matt Lauer after ratings began to decline. Executives reportedly felt  Curry  and Lauer didn't have chemistry. Lauer was fired from Today in November 2017 over allegations of sexual misconduct.
 Curry  tells NPR's It's Been a Minute that  she  and others faced ""verbal sexual harassment"" on Today. But  she  has pushed past that difficult time and says  she 's now pursuing stories that matter to  her  — stories  she  feels aren't being covered enough in today's news climate.
It started actually with my co-executive producer  a woman named Justine Kershaw  who as a young woman had fallen off a mountain.  She  had been hiking  and  she  was in Europe.  She  was a dancer. And  she  ripped  you know  so much of  herself  up.  She  was really hurt by this fall. And there were a couple of men who were  I believe they were goat herders  and they sort of happened by and they rescued  her . They carried  her  down the mountain. They made sure  she  got to care.
And then years later  after  she  had no longer been dancing and  she  now was a wife and  she  had children   she  decided that  she  wanted to go back to this mountain. It was something kind of meaningful to  her  about it. So  she  went back to the mountain and  she  ran into  not expecting to  the goat herders. And what really stunned  her  was their reaction. They started sobbing and really were just so glad to see  her  and so glad to see how well  she  was doing because they never heard what happened after  she  had left on that emergency exit  you know  to a hospital to patch  her  back up.
So this sort of had been a part of  her   realizing that there was this need for people to connect in these kinds of moments  and not just the person who was hurt  but the person on the other side. And so fast-forward many  many years  this thing had been percolating.  She  had this kind of  well  rough idea about what if we did something like that.

3489,New Giants coach Pat Shurmur derives strength from home,Pat Shurmur,"Who  Pat Shurmur? No. No way Kyle learned that diligence from his dad who  as a sophomore offensive lineman and linebacker at Dearborn Divine Child (Mich.) in 1980  asked coach Wes Wishart to borrow the program’s lone projector to host weekly 16mm film study sessions at his house.
Like father  like son. And so like  Pat Shurmur  to have family at the center of one of  his  football stories.
 Pat Shurmur  makes it clear how much  his  family means to  him  as  he  meets the media for the first time as Giants head coach. (Howard Simmons/New York Daily News)
Friday morning  in fact  Shurmur teared up in his introductory press conference in East Rutherford as he looked at his wife  Jennifer  of 27-and-a-half years and called her “the strength of our family.” The couple  who met at Michigan State  have four children: Allyson and Erica  college graduates who live in Philadelphia; Kyle  Vanderbilt’s rising-senior starting quarterback; and Claire  a high school freshman in Minnesota  where  Pat  last worked.
But while  Pat  is the high-profile NFL head coach and the hard-nosed former Spartans center who laid waste to USC defensive linemen in the 1988 Rose Bowl  he is also the humble and human husband honorable enough to publicly recognize the woman who has been his rock the whole way:
“I didn’t know what G.O.A.T. meant until about a year ago  but that’s what Jennifer’s kids refer to her as: The G.O.A.T ” Gordon  still a family friend  said of the acronym for Greatest Of All Time more often used in NFL circles in reference to Tom Brady. “The Shurmurs are a great family. That’s what always comes through to people  and quite honestly  that’s probably what enables  Pat  to do what  he  does.”
Wishart says  Shurmur  came from a family with an admirable “work ethic” before  he  and Jennifer started their own.
 Pat Shurmur  is tasked with returning winning ways back to the Giants. (Howard Simmons/New York Daily News)
 Shurmur ’s late father  Joe  a star offensive guard and linebacker at Albion College (Mich.) in the late 1950s and early 60s  was an orthopedic surgeon in Dearborn  Mich.  and later served as the team doctor for  Pat ’s high school squad.
 Pat ’s uncle  the late Fritz Shurmur  actually coached his brother Joe at Albion before going on to a long accomplished NFL coaching career  including a Super Bowl XXXI victory as Mike Holmgren’s defensive coordinator in Green Bay.
But more simply  Joe and Barbara Shurmur raised their four children “to work hard and do things the right way ” Wishart says.  Pat Shurmur  on Friday lauded how  his  parents “taught us to compete; they taught us how to have compassion; and they taught us how not to let anybody tell you that you can’t do something.”
And when Wishart visited  Shurmur  in Cleveland for one of his Browns OTA practices during his two-year stint as head coach from 2011-12  he saw all of Joe and Barbara’s values and lessons on display on the field.
“He talked to every player  knew every player  had something positive to say about all of them  and he had 90-some guys on the roster ” Wishart recalled. “When he was a player  there was no better teammate. If a guy made a mistake   Pat  was the first to put arm around him and say hey it’s over with  forget about it. And that was it: if you have good relationships with people and players  you’ve got a team.
Carl Banks  55  the Giants’ two-time Super Bowl-winning linebacker and current radio analyst  was a stud Michigan State senior when  Shurmur  arrived in East Lansing as a freshman in 1983.  Shurmur  would split a season at linebacker and guard before starting three years at center and serving as a co-captain his senior year. What does Banks remember?
In 2013  when the Shurmurs relocated to Cinnaminson  N.J.  and  Kyle Shurmur  transferred to LaSalle   his  father could have been the overbearing NFL coach micromanaging a son’s career. Not so.
“The first time I met  Pat  I said  ‘By the way   Pat   this is probably the last time I’m gonna talk to you ” Gordon  now retired  said laughing. “He kinda laughed and I said  ‘I don’t talk to parents about football.’ And he said  ‘Great  I get it.’  Pat  was great about it. The only thing I ever got from  Pat  was a text that said  ‘Nice job’ or something on Saturday night. But he participated in the program like a lot of the parents did with the snack stand  Gatorade at halftime  stuff like that  and he came to a lot of the games  all the ones he could based on the (Eagles’) schedule. He’s a terrific person.”","Who  Pat Shurmur?

3490,We Are All Harvey Weinstein's Victims...and Enablers,Harvey Weinstein,"The  Harvey Weinstein  story continues to reverberate  as new accusations  denunciations  or other consequences of  his  decades of sexual harassment seem to come to light every day.  Weinstein  has dutifully been abandoned by company  industry  friends  politicians  and family.
Of all of the articles and accounts of this scandal  the most telling so far appeared in the Weekly Standard on October 9. Lee Smith  instead of merely repeating fresh condemnations  focused on how  Weinstein  had gotten the industry to protect  him  for so long.  Weinstein 's power in both the movie and publishing industries insured that  he  could purchase an army of enablers. But simply stating that fact does not go far enough. One must imagine the relevant scenarios and take them to their logical conclusions  as does Smith:
They [the ""journalists"" who protected  Weinstein ] wouldn't dream of crossing a guy who could turn them into culture heroes with a phone call. Hey  I just optioned your novel and I already know who's going to make the movie. And oh yeah  please confirm that you don't  like I think I may have heard  have a reporter looking into a story about me.
Imagine the implications of that scenario.  Weinstein 's sexual assaults became so frequent that  his  publishing and moviemaking decisions were geared toward covering up those assaults. Those whose employees might be investigating  Weinstein  became prime candidates to have their articles turn into books and movies. Instant stardom and riches awaited those who would keep quiet.
Over the past thirty years  few individuals have exercised more influence over the national culture than  Harvey Weinstein .  His  movies have been well known. At one time  ""Miramax bought the rights to every big story published in magazines throughout [New York] city.""  His  financial contributions bought access and more to the White House.  He  made careers from Hollywood to New York to Washington. I need not list  his  beneficiaries  but they are well known (some of whom now issue obligatory press releases denouncing  Weinstein 's decades of mayhem).
Not only did this influence provide cover for  Weinstein  as  he  victimized Hollywood's women  but it created a whole new class of victims who have been ignored over the past week (and apparently the previous few decades). I refer to Hollywood's consumers.  We  complain about  our  choices in movies (and television).  We  lament that there is nothing to watch (even though  we  spend exorbitant amounts to see and subscribe to these nothings). There have always been theories as to why  our  entertainment lacks quality. Now  Harvey Weinstein  has provided  us  with the most interesting theory of all. If the Weekly Standard's scenario is correct  then  Weinstein 's choices in movies and even book options were motivated not by quality (or even his own bottom line)  but by the need to cover up rape and sexual harassment.
The nation's media now devote endless bandwidth to ever more breathless denunciations by those who were all too happy to take  Weinstein 's money as long as the accusations could be squelched. But instead of serving as a conduit for the press releases of  Weinstein 's former allies and enablers  maybe our nation's ""journalists"" should try a different approach. Maybe they should research actual correlations between  Weinstein 's movies and  his  cover-ups. We now have enough accusations to span several decades of movie production and distribution. How hard could it be for the New York Times or the Washington Post to figure out which Miramax movies resulted from which rape coverups? Who was  Weinstein  paying off by approving or distributing which movie?
If recent press releases are any indication  it appears that  Weinstein  was not alone. The problem appears to be widespread. Who knows how many movie deals resulted from the need to cover up some sex scandal? How many scandals are our movie dollars suppressing? Should we simply applaud Hollywood for belatedly denouncing  Weinstein  and then file back into the theaters?","The  [TGT]story continues to reverberate  as new accusations  denunciations  or other consequences of  his  decades of sexual harassment seem to come to light every day.

3492,Ross  Douthat 's Latest Gun Control Proposals Miss The Mark,Ross Douthat,"In his most recent column for The New York Times  conservative writer  Ross   Douthat  tackled the mass shooting at a school in Parkland  Florida  which left 17 innocent people dead. While  Douthat  is typically measured and even-handed in considering what is driving men of a certain age and demographic profile to purchase deadly weapons and direct their fire at innocent people  his recommended solution to the problem — age-based bans on certain weapons — completely misses the mark.
Specifically   Douthat  recommends that “hunting rifles ” which  he  does not define  be legal to own once an individual reaches 18 years of age. Revolvers  under Douthat’s suggested gun control regime  would be legal at age 21. Semi-automatic pistols would be legal when an individual turned 25  and semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15 could not be sold to anyone under 30:
Those data alone  which show that mass shootings are far more likely to be committed by those outside of  Douthat ’s proposed limits  demonstrate the folly of his gun control recommendations. But it’s not just the actual age of shooters which calls into question  Douthat ’s age-based bans; weapon usage statistics also contradict  his  calls for new strict regulations on rifles.
It's a Times list  and not school-specific  but about half of these feature semi-auto rifles. Again  just seems like there's a big gap btw what ppl use for ordinary murder (mostly handguns) and these kind of deliberate sprees.https://t.co/phyGdzCHGY — Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) February 17  2018
Forget the 25/30 provocation for now; do you think it would be a disastrous infringement on liberty if the age for semi-autos in FL had been 21 and not 18? — Ross Douthat (@DouthatNYT) February 17  2018
While I respect and share  Douthat ’s desire to find a solution to the problem of mass shootings  I simply disagree with not only  his  recommendations  but also their premise. The data clearly show that  his  proposals would do little to address  his  stated problem. The bigger issue  however  is one of principle. A nation cannot be made safer from criminals by restricting the God-given rights of those who respect and follow the law. My Second Amendment right to defend myself is every bit as important and vital as Douthat’s First Amendment right to publish his political opinions as he pleases without interference from the government.","In his most recent column for The New York Times  conservative writer  Ross   Douthat  tackled the mass shooting at a school in Parkland  Florida  which left 17 innocent people dead.

3493,CBS clarifies after saying Colin Kaepernick would stand for anthem,Jason La Canfora,"Jason La Canfora  said in a series of tweets on Sunday that  he  was relaying previous reporting about Kaepernick and did not ask whether the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback would sit or stand during the anthem when  he  spoke about  his  interview with the player during a pregame show.
The reversal came after anchor James Brown asked  La Canfora  on “The NFL Today”: “And kneeling   he  said?”
 La Canfora  responded: “ He ’s not planning on kneeling.  He ’s going to donate all  his  jersey sales and  he ’s planning on standing for the anthem if given the opportunity  J.B.”
La Canfora tweeted later that  he  does not know what Kaepernick would do during the anthem.
Relying on unnamed sources  ESPN reported in March that Kaepernick would stand during the anthem if  he  played again. But Kaepernick has not spoken publicly about what  he  would do.
After La Canfora backed off  his  earlier report  Kaepernick tweeted: “A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on ” attributing the quote to Winston Churchill even though some scholars have said the quote was not said by the former British prime minister.
According to CBS   La Canfora  sat down with Kaepernick  his girlfriend and his trainer on Saturday night.  La Canfora  summarized their conversation but the segment did not air any comments directly made by the player.
 La Canfora  said  his  “primary takeaway” was that Kaepernick’s sole focus is on being a quarterback. Kaepernick does on-field work and throws hundreds of passes for several hours a day at an undisclosed location in New Jersey   La Canfora  said.  La Canfora  said Kaepernick also trains in a gym and spends part of his days working with youth in Harlem.","""[TGT]said in a series of tweets on Sunday that  [TGT]  was relaying previous reporting about Kaepernick and did not ask whether the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback would sit or stand during the anthem when  [TGT]  spoke about  [TGT]  interview with the player during a pregame show.

3494,Ashley Judd gets the praise she deserves for being first to speak publicly against Weinstein,Harvey Weinstein,"As more and more damning sexual harassment and assault allegations pile up against Harvey Weinstein  people who make their living in Hollywood are praising the bravery of the women who came forward — in particular Ashley Judd  who was the first celebrity to speak on the record in last week's New York Times report.
“I said no  a lot of ways  a lot of times  and he always came back at me with some new ask ” the actress told The New York Times  describing shooting down a persistent  Weinstein . ""It was all this bargaining  this coercive bargaining.”
In wake of Judd's courageous decision to speak up about  Weinstein 's harssment and reveal her identity  women in Hollywood are praising her bravery and strength. (We've contacted Judd for comment.)

On Tuesday afternoon The New York Times published another article featuring interviews from a more celebrities — Gwyneth Paltrow  Angelina Jolie  Rosanna Arquette  Katherine Kendall and more — who all accused  Weinstein  of sexual harassment.
In response to the women revealing their chilling accounts of  Weinstein 's behavior  other women were eager to publicly offer their support and celebrate the survivors' bravery. The tweets were notable both for their supportive nature in a cutthroat industry and on a social media platform known more and more for bullying and hate speech than expressions of solidarity.

3496,Bigelow Aerospace plans to send inflatable hotel to orbit the moon,Bigelow Aerospace,"Bigelow Aerospace  says  its  inflatable space hotel could be ready for lunar orbit by 2022.
 Bigelow  is touting the future pod as a hub for ""lunar business development "" but  the company  would probably need  NASA  to get  it  funded.
 Bigelow Aerospace  a Las Vegas-based space pod company   wants to send an inflatable space hotel to orbit the moon  with accommodations for astronauts and citizen space travelers alike.
 The company  partnered with  NASA  in 2016 to attach an inflatable  soft-shell demo pod onto the International Space Station. Now   Bigelow  has announced that a bigger inflatable pod  which it's calling the B330 ""lunar depot""  could be orbiting the moon in five years.
That moon station is much more ambitious than  Bigelow 's ISS add-on. It's designed to stand alone and is about a third of the size of the ISS.  The company  suggests the pod could hold roughly six people  and is billing it as a hub for ""significant lunar business development.""
Providing accommodations for future space travelers is a logical next step for  the company 's founder  Robert Bigelow  who owns the Budget Suites of America hotel chain and has been working on creating expandable space modules since 1999.
United Launch Alliance  a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin  plans to partner with  Bigelow  to launch the habitat into space  then get it circling around the moon.
Expandable  soft-shell space habitats are easier to fit into rockets for launch than other heavier structures.  Bigelow  said in a statement that  its  pods also “provide for greater volume  safety  opportunity and economy than the aluminum alternatives.”
The company's 'Bigelow Expandable Activity Module ' or BEAM  was attached to the International Space Station in April 2016 and then blown up to full size that May. Astronauts don't live inside it  but they use the space for experiments  collecting air and surface samples to test for microbes  as well as monitoring how effective the BEAM is at blocking radiation. NASA has said it might extend BEAM's stay at the ISS beyond its initial two year test run  and use the inflatable space as long-term storage. The space agency has said that so far  the soft materials  Bigelow  used to create BEAM are proving they can perform just as well as more rigid structures in space.
In a couple of Tweets on Tuesday   Bigelow  seemed to suggest that  he 'd need NASA funding to fully execute  his  space hotel plans. The Washington Post puts the project's price tag at $2.3 billion.
""Re. Lunar Depot: Capital has been flowing from both companies and will continue ""  Bigelow  wrote  then added  ""NASA & this country will need to have investment also to pay for the benefits.""
NASA is currently working on a 'Deep Space Gateway' project with the Russian Space Agency  which could involve a site near the moon that would serve as a pit-stop for astronauts on long-term missions to Mars. NASA has said that site would have a ""small habitat to extend crew time."" In a statement sent to Business Insider  NASA confirmed  Bigelow  is one of six companies the agency has selected to develop full-size prototypes for the habitat.
The US has pledged to send humans to Mars by 2033. In an announcement about the B330 last year   Bigelow  and United Launch Alliance said that this habitat could house researchers on their way to the Red Planet.","[TGT]says  [TGT]  inflatable space hotel could be ready for lunar orbit by 2022.

3497,Bitcoin Gold is the latest Bitcoin clone,Bitcoin Gold,"Bitcoin Gold   a new cryptocurrency  has been created through a so-called hard fork similar to the way Bitcoin Cash was created in August.
Since Bitcoin and  Bitcoin Gold  share the same history up until the fork  anyone who owned Bitcoin around 8pm E.T. Monday should become the owner of the same amount of Bitcoin Gold as well. But as is often the case with Bitcoin  things are not that simple.
First of  all  the Bitcoin Gold network  is not yet live.  Its  creators have merely taken a snapshot of the Bitcoin blockchain at block 491 407  but the cryptocurrency should become publicly available on Nov. 1.
Those who stored bitcoins at exchanges might see different results  depending on the exchange. Some exchanges  including Coinbase and BitMEX  said they will not support  Bitcoin Gold  at all (though Coinbase did say it might support it at a later date). Others  like Bittrex  said  Bitcoin  owners will receive their  Bitcoin Gold  at a 1:1 ratio. Only a few of the major exchanges said they would support  Bitcoin Gold  trading.
 Bitcoin Gold 's main reason to exist  according to the project's website  is ASIC-resistant mining. Originally   Bitcoin  could be mined (the process of mining creates new coins and powers the Bitcoin network at the same time) by anyone with a PC. However  Bitcoin's network is currently dominated by big mining companies  which employ specialized mining machines called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits).  Bitcoin Gold  uses a different mining algorithm which will once again enable mining by anyone with a home PC.
However   Bitcoin Gold  has received quite a bit of criticism for being hastily put together  and for pre-mining a certain amount of coins  which essentially mean free money or the project's owners.
Despite the controversy  the price of  Bitcoin  rose to more than $6 100 days before the fork  likely due to  Bitcoin  owners calculating that getting some free BTG can't hurt them  even if the project turns out to be a failure. Many were likely hoping for a reprise of the Bitcoin Cash fork in August. Despite initial reluctance from exchanges  Bitcoin Cash has turned out to be quite successful so far  currently trading at about $330 with a market cap of more than $5.5 billion.","Bitcoin Gold   a new cryptocurrency  has been created through a so-called hard fork similar to the way Bitcoin Cash was created in August.

3498,Impending Colts coach Josh McDaniels says he's grown since Denver,Josh McDaniels Chuck,"As the New England Patriots fidgeted during their hour-long media session Monday night ahead of Super Bowl LII  offensive coordinator  Josh McDaniels  was confronted with the inquiry  he  knew full well was coming:
It appears  after his second stint in New England – now in its sixth season – McDaniels is ready to make that move. It will be to Indianapolis  where he and the Colts are expected to consummate a deal to make him Chuck Pagano’s successor after the completion of the Super Bowl. The Colts and  McDaniels  can’t execute a deal until he’s fulfilled his duties with the Patriots.
But it’s coming  and  McDaniels  seemingly has been thinking about this moment for quite a while.  He ’s been entertaining the idea of pursuing another head-coaching gig for some time  but this year  he  finally felt the time was right. For  McDaniels   it was a matter of when  not if.
“That’s been a dream of mine forever ”  he  said. “My dad’s been a football coach all my life. I grew up around the game. I played as long as I could but I wasn’t very big or very fast or very good. So  I knew I was going to end up being a coach somewhere  somehow. I just wanted to try to get better and whatever the cards held for me  that’s great. I’d be OK with that.
“Right now  this week is special for one reason and that’s because we’re here with an opportunity to compete against the Eagles for the Super Bowl championship ”  McDaniels  said  staying on message.
But when the opportunity to be a head coach comes – cough  next week  cough –  McDaniels  clearly plans to do things differently after the apparent personality conflicts  he  left in  his  wake in Denver.
“You have people you learn from every day and you have people that you’re responsible to teach ”  he  said. “And the only way for those two things to work the right way is to have quality relationships. They go both directions. You have to be a good listener and a good teacher. You have to be willing to take advice from somebody else and you have to be willing to give it when it’s your turn.”

The government also deported  Odinga ’s adviser  Miguna Miguna  despite five court orders for him to be produced in front of a judge and released on bail.
 Odinga  claims  he  was cheated of victory in Kenya’s August presidential election by hackers who altered the vote. Kenya’s Supreme Court nullified the results of that election after  Odinga  challenged Kenyatta’s win.
The court ordered a fresh election  which  Odinga  boycotted  saying significant electoral reforms were needed. Kenyatta’s party instead changed electoral law to make it harder for courts to nullify results.
 Odinga   in an interview with The Associated Press last year  accused western diplomats of supporting the Kenyatta government.","The diplomats said [TGT] needs to accept Kenyatta’s presidency “as the basis for the dialogue that it (the opposition) and many Kenyans want.”

3500,Washington Wizards need to fix turnovers problem,Bradley Beal,"Bradley Beal had an off night on the offensive end of the floor but it was turnovers that hurt the Wizards the most. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
As Wizards players reacted to the 109-101 loss  they lamented the sluggish start (8-of-23 shooting in the first)  the hopeless third quarter in which they scored only 14 points  and the excessive fouling that sent Curry to the stripe for 12 free-throw attempts. But  Bradley Beal  put the responsibility for the loss squarely on  himself .  His  scoreless drought for 2 1/2 quarters ( he  finished with a 3-of-15 shooting total) certainly stained the box score  however  Beal  accepted blame for  his  five turnovers.
“I’ve had a lot of them. Just careless ones ”  Beal  said. “Just losing the ball  ball slipping.”
Beal  who plays dual roles in creating for others while still leading the team in scoring  has six games with four turnovers or more since Wall has been out. On Wednesday   Beal ’s third turnover — which  he  lost while still sitting on an 0-for-8 shooting mark — allowed Golden State’s Klay Thompson to hit a transition triple in the midst of a 9-2 run in the third quarter.","[TGT] had an off night on the offensive end of the floor but it was turnovers that hurt the Wizards the most.

Suddenly the improved structure that had pulled the Rangers out of their early-season pit of misery  keyed them to six straight wins and was even present against the Blackhawks in the first period started to fracture. So badly that  Henrik Lundqvist  was pulled in the third period of the Rangers’ 6-3 loss after  he  was stellar through two periods.
“We weren’t defending at all ” Alain Vigneault said of his decision to replace  Lundqvist  with Ondrej Pavelec at 6:28 of the third after Chicago scored three goals in the first 5:14 of the period to take a 4-1 lead.
The Rangers (9-8-2) were outshot 34-17 over the final two periods.  Lundqvist  was turning away everything in sight in a hectic second until an Alex DeBrincat shot  which  Lundqvist  said  he  saw late  trickled through  his  legs and rolled over the goal line with 51.6 seconds left in the period  tying the game at 1 apiece.

3507,Historians say John Kelly has the Civil War wrong,John Kelly,"Washington (CNN) White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Tuesday defended White House chief of staff  John Kelly   after his praise of Robert E. Lee as an ""honorable man"" and comments that the Civil War began because of ""the lack of an ability to compromise.""
 Kelly 's comments  made during an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham  re-ignited a political firestorm sparked earlier this year about whether Confederate generals should still be venerated with statues in American cities.
A number of historians and journalists were sharply critical of  Kelly 's comments and Sanders' defense  accusing the chief of staff of misunderstanding the key issue over which the Civil War began.
""I think  Kelly 's comments marginalize the central issue of the war  which was the expansion of slavery "" Edna Greene Medford  a professor of history at Howard University  told CNN. ""Absolutely  there were differences over the expansion of that institution which led to secession and secession led to war  but to conclude that it's about people not being able to compromise  it's just too simplistic.""
The debate over Civil War history is long-simmering but has reached new heights during the Trump administration. That heightening and  Kelly 's comments come at a time during which President Donald Trump has been scrutinized for his response to racial acrimony.
Some critics drew parallels between  Kelly 's comments to Ingraham and Trump's inciting remarks earlier this year in which he blamed both sides for the deadly violence in Charlottesville  Virginia  that left one counter protester dead after a car crashed into a crowd.","Washington (CNN) White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Tuesday defended White House chief of staff  [TGT]   after [TGT] praise of Robert E.

3512,Why Claypool had to go as Emanuel's CPS chief,Forrest Claypool,"One by one  school board members  religious leaders and even Mayor Rahm Emanuel stepped to the microphone to praise soon-to-be-former Chicago Public Schools CEO Forrest Claypool.
“I’ve known  Forrest  for 30-plus years  the whole time in my life of public life and public service  and I want to thank  Forrest  for  his  exemplary service to the city of Chicago. Wherever  he  has worked  he  has left an incredible and indelible mark on every endeavor ” a visibly tired Emanuel said. “I can say  he  can walk out with  his  head high  because  he  did a job well. And  he  will always be my friend.”
Six attorneys ultimately recommended that Marmer shouldn't manage the contract because he has received about $200 000 a year in severance payments from the firm he used to work at.  Claypool  turned to a seventh attorney — a longtime contact and political donor — who blessed the situation.
In the process   Claypool  asked veteran labor attorney James Franczek to reword a bill for his legal advice to disguise its original purpose  according to the report. In interviews with the IG during the investigation   Claypool  “unequivocally  emphatically and repeatedly” denied he had asked Franczek to make changes to the bill  and said “he would never have been involved in such lowly billing matters.”
But last month  in a letter to the IG's office   Claypool  apologized for intervening to reword the invoice.  Claypool 's letter acknowledged Inspector General Nicholas Schuler had documents that contradicted the CEO's initial claim.
With that  the mayor bid  Claypool  a very public adieu.
Fairley said  Claypool ’s departure was “the only way forward.”
As word of  Claypool ’s resignation spread  members of the Chicago Teachers Union  community activists and some aldermen celebrated.  Claypool    they  said  did not listen to teachers about the realities inside the city’s schools and the impact sharp budget cuts and privatization contracts had on their operations.
“I think it showed a lack of political courage. What you saw was a mayor whose first impulse was to back up his friend  despite  Forrest ’s many failings  despite the lack of credibility  Forrest  has with people who matter most — parents  teachers and educators ” Sharkey said. “And then you see him quickly drop  Forrest  as soon as it seems like there is political heat and ramifications back on the mayor. Where’s the courage there?”
Though he called on  Claypool  to resign  Ruiz stopped short of criticizing Emanuel for standing by his ally. The mayor and  Claypool  have known each other for 37 years  dating back to when the two 20-somethings worked on a Downstate congressional campaign.","One by one  school board members  religious leaders and even Mayor Rahm Emanuel stepped to the microphone to praise [TGT].
“I’ve known  Forrest  for 30-plus years  the whole time in my life of public life and public service  and I want to thank  Forrest  for  his  exemplary service to the city of Chicago. Wherever  he  has worked  he  has left an incredible and indelible mark on every endeavor ” a visibly tired Emanuel said. “I can say  he  can walk out with  his  head high  because  he  did a job well. And  he  will always be my friend.”
Six attorneys ultimately recommended that Marmer shouldn't manage the contract because he has received about $200 000 a year in severance payments from the firm he used to work at.  [TGT]turned to a seventh attorney — a longtime contact and political donor — who blessed the situation.
In the process   [TGT]asked veteran labor attorney James Franczek to reword a bill for his legal advice to disguise its original purpose  according to the report. In interviews with the IG during the investigation   [TGT]“unequivocally  emphatically and repeatedly” denied he had asked Franczek to make changes to the bill  and said “he would never have been involved in such lowly billing matters.”
But last month  in a letter to the IG's office   Claypool  apologized for intervening to reword the invoice.  [TGT] 's letter acknowledged Inspector General Nicholas Schuler had documents that contradicted the CEO's initial claim.
With that  the mayor bid  Claypool  a very public adieu.

3513,Harvey Weinstein accused of raping 3 women sexually harassing Gwyneth Paltrow Angelina Jolie,Harvey Weinstein,"Lurid allegations against  Harvey Weinstein  spread like wildfire on Tuesday as A-list actresses Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow accused the studio head of harassment  and the New Yorker published an exposé with claims  he  raped three women and forced  himself  on four more.
Paltrow told the New York Times Weinstein invited her to  his  suite at the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel after casting her in the lead role for ""Emma"" and suggested they go to the bedroom for massages.
""I was a kid  I was signed up  I was petrified "" Paltrow told the Times. Then 22  she confided in her boyfriend Brad Pitt what had happened  and Pitt later confronted  Weinstein .
According to  Paltrow  Weinstein  threatened  her  to keep  her  quiet.
""I thought he was going to fire me ""  she  said of the producer who helped jump-start  her  career.
 WEINSTEIN 'S WIFE CONCERNED ABOUT HER FASHION EMPIRE
Jolie also told the paper she ""had a bad experience with  Harvey Weinstein  in my youth.""
Several other women shared similar expieriences in a shocking exposé by Ronan Farrow for the New Yorker. Farrow detailed  Weinstein 's alleged decades-long history of threatening aspiring actresses and employees if they refused his sexual advances.
Three of the women who spoke with Farrow said  Weinstein  raped them  one of which later refused to speak on the record. Four more women said they experienced unwanted touching and four others said  Weinstein  masturbated in front of them or exposed  himself .
Current and former Weinstein Company employees admitted to the New Yorker many at the company knew of  Weinstein 's behavior towards women and said some employees acted as ""honeypot[s]"" to attract women to meetings with  Weinstein  only to leave the women alone with the producer.
One of the more serious allegations comes from Italian actress and director Asia Argento who alleged that  Weinstein  forcibly performed oral sex on her.
She said she did not come forward earlier out of fear  Weinstein  would ""crush"" her.
Argento said she later had a consensual sexual relationship with  Weinstein  because she felt ""obliged.""
Another woman  Lucia Evans  alleged  Weinstein  forced her to perform oral sex on him in 2004. Evans was an aspiring actress at the time and had heard rumors about  Weinstein 's behavior but agreed to meet him at Miramax's New York office after she was told a female casting agent would be present.

3514,Garrison Keillor fired for 'inappropriate behavior',Garrison Keillor,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Garrison Keillor  whose stories of small-town characters entertained legions of public radio listeners for 40 years on ""A Prairie Home Companion "" became another celebrity felled by allegations of workplace misconduct on Wednesday when Minnesota Public Radio terminated his contracts.
MPR said only that it received allegations of ""inappropriate behavior"" against  Keillor  last month involving one person who worked with him during his time hosting ""A Prairie Home Companion.""  Keillor  retired as host of the radio variety show last year  but continued to work for MPR on various projects.
Later Wednesday   Keillor  gave a statement to MPR News saying he had to ""respect the privacy of the two employees who have made the allegations."" A spokeswoman for MPR's corporate arm didn't immediately respond to questions from AP on whether  Keillor  was accused of bad behavior with more than one person.
 Keillor 's hand-picked successor to host the show  mandolinist Chris Thile  tweeted Wednesday he was ""in shock"" after  Keillor 's firing. Thile had been a frequent musical guest on the show and said he knew nothing about the allegation  adding: ""I trust that the proper steps are being taken.""

 Keillor 's storytelling earned him comparisons with Mark Twain and Will Rogers. His 1985 best-selling book  ""Lake Wobegon Days "" landed him on the cover of Time magazine.

3515,Trump addresses raid of Paul Manafort's home,Paul Manafort,"President Donald Trump said  he  was surprised to hear about the FBI's July predawn raid of  his  former campaign chairman's home  saying it was a ""very strong signal.""
The raid — reportedly an effort to obtain  Paul Manafort 's tax documents and foreign banking records — was conducted as part of the agency's ongoing investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The fact that the FBI was able to obtain a search warrant indicates that Mueller managed to convince a federal judge that  Manafort  would try to conceal or destroy documents subpoenaed by a grand jury.
""Mueller and his staff may have decided that  despite the claims of cooperation from  Manafort ’s lawyer   Manafort  could not be trusted to provide all of the documents requested by subpoena "" wrote Harvard Law School professor Alex Whitting  who served for a decade as a federal prosecutor at the Justice Department and the US Attorney's office in Boston.
The payments  and  Manafort 's activities in Ukraine more broadly  were examined more closely following Yanukovych's ouster on corruption charges in 2014.  Manafort  has been associated with at least 15 bank accounts and 10 companies in Cyprus  dating back to 2007  NBC reported in March  and  he  was reportedly $17 million in debt to pro-Russian interests by the time  he  joined the Trump campaign.","President Donald Trump said  he  was surprised to hear about the FBI's July predawn raid of  his  former campaign chairman's home  saying it was a ""very strong signal.""

3517,Bitcoin Soars Above $7 000 for First Time,Bitcoin,"The price of  Bitcoin  smashed another record early Thursday morning — $7 000 for each unit of the digital currency.
As of 7 AM Eastern time  BTC is selling for $7 191.16  according to data from Coinbase.  Bitcoin — which is minted by a decentralized network of miners  not a governing body —  hit this latest benchmark with a single-day increase of nearly $640  only 13 days after  it  first became valued at $6 000. If an individual bought 1 BTC exactly one month ago  it has grown $2 902.33 or +67.67% in value.
The surge came just days after CME Group  the world’s largest futures exchange  announced it would begin offering its customers contracts for trading  Bitcoin  futures.
 Bitcoin’s  meteoric rise continues amid uncertainty about  its  future. In a few weeks  the currency will undergo a “hard fork ” or a split in  Bitcoin ’s blockchain  creating two different versions of the currency to implement a coding update that has been extremely controversial in the Bitcoin community. “Segwit2x ” which is designed to increase the number of transactions that the BTC blockchain can handle  will have drastic effects on the currency’s mining process.
Earlier this week  Bitcoin prices surged over speculation that China might relent as the October 31 deadline approached for its announced ban on domestic digital currency exchanges trading against the yuan. However  the People’s Republic followed through  and now existing Chines exchanges have shifted their operations to other Asian countries.
Ethereum  the top digital currency behind  Bitcoin   has plunged in price as  Bitcoin  enjoys its massive surge  falling from a 24-hour high of $301.41 to $277.82 Thursday morning.

A force made up of U.S-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service units  Federal Police and Iranian-backed fighters known as Popular Mobilisation began their advance on Altun Kupri at 7:30 a.m. (0430 GMT)  said an Iraqi military spokesman.
The fighting at  Altun Kupri  marked only the second instance of significant violent resistance by the Kurds in Kirkuk province. Dozens were killed or wounded in the previous clash on Monday  the first night of the government advance.
The U.S. State Department said it was concerned by reports of violent clashes around  Altun Kupri .
Altun Kupri is the last town in Kirkuk province on the road to Erbil  lying just outside the border of the autonomous region established after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad’s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region  mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants.

3522,Charles Manson cult leader and murder,Charles Manson Jr.,"Charles Manson  spent over 46 years in prison for the vicious murders of seven people in 1969  including actress Sharon Tate. After  his  lengthy trial and conviction   Manson  became a constant and morbid presence in pop culture. (Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)
A prelude to the conflagration was the slaughter of the seven people in two affluent Los Angeles neighborhoods. Orchestrated by  Mr. Manson  on two successive nights in August 1969  the seemingly random killings were calculated to hasten the race war by making them appear committed by black militants. That  in turn   he  told  his  followers  would stir white sentiment against African Americans  triggering widespread violence by blacks.
Vincent Bugliosi  the hard-charging deputy district attorney who prosecuted Mr. Manson  described the  Manson  name as “a metaphor for evil.”
 Mr. Manson  was a study in stark contrasts. Small and scrawny   he  was also charismatic and held an almost hypnotic power over  his  followers  especially women. Some believed  he  was divine.
Investigators  academic researchers and journalists found  him  alternately erratic and focused  a proficient guitarist  a lover of animals  a racist and an anti-Semite with a left-leaning hatred of the “establishment” and corporate America and bitterness over  his  rejection by the music celebrity world of Hollywood.
 He  was not insane  but  he  could fake it and had an insatiable need to control others  prompting  him  to recruit naive and malleable acolytes to  his  family  according to behaviorists who studied  his  life.
“Basically  Manson was a coward ” Eric Hickey  dean of the California School of Forensic Studies at Alliant International University  told Maclean’s magazine in 2012. “ He  was the kind of guy who had other people do  his  bidding  and I think  he  really enjoyed taking advantage of people who were gullible.”
He married twice  first to a teenage waitress  Rosalie Willis  in 1955  divorcing in 1958. Then in 1959  he married a woman with a prostitution record named Leona “Candy” Stevens  according to prison records. That union also ended in divorce. A son from his first marriage  Charles Manson Jr.  who renamed himself Jay White  committed suicide in 1993. He had a son from his second marriage  Charles Luther Manson. He had at least one other child as well.
Prosecutors depicted  Mr. Manson  as the meticulous mastermind of the murders  and while family members acknowledged  his  planning role  they said  he  did not participate in the killings. The jury nevertheless found  him  equally culpable under California’s joint-responsibility rule.
 He  was also convicted for the July 1969 murder of Gary Hinman  and the August 1969 murder of Donald Shea  according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.","Charles Manson  spent over 46 years in prison for the vicious murders of seven people in 1969  including actress Sharon Tate.

3523,Hurricane Harvey destroyed their school. Now they share a building with their rival.,Abbie Brabham,"For  Abbie Brabham  a senior on Kingwood’s varsity girls’ basketball team   sports were a welcome distraction from Harvey’s fallout — destroyed homes  friends’ families starting over from scratch — and an opportunity to spend more time with  her  teammates  whom  she  considers  her  sisters.
Kayaks  boats  inflatable rafts  canoes and helicopters came through the neighborhood  as rescuers — some professional  some amateur — responded to neighbors who literally waved white flags.  Brabham  and her family were evacuated by one of her classmates  who drove his 4x4 truck to the house the first night of the flooding.

Inside  Brabham ’s home  any items that weren’t on higher ground were left drifting atop the water. The backyard looked like an extension of the San Jacinto River  with a sliver of a black fence poking above the still-moving water. An inflatable toy swan floated in the corner of the family’s living room  blown up by  Brabham  the night of the floods in case she needed it to evacuate.
“I was like  ‘If I am forced to float out of here  I’ll float out in style ’” said  Brabham   one of 262 Kingwood students who were unable to live in their homes following the hurricane. “But after the storm  the swan was a sign of hope that we had our stuff and we could eventually get back.”

At the time of the hurricane   Brabham ’s vision of walking through the doors for her senior year at Kingwood was only days away. That day still hasn’t come.
“It was very emotional at first ” said  Brabham   18. “I had grown up in Kingwood and my sister had went to Kingwood  so honestly  it was pretty bad at the beginning. It is my senior year and my house flooded and it is kind of difficult to move schools.”
Kingwood and Summer Creek are different demographically.  Brabham  represents the majority of Kingwood  which is almost 74 percent white  with 5.5 percent of  its  students economically disadvantaged  according to the Texas Education Agency. Summer Creek  which opened in 2009  is 43.5 percent economically disadvantaged and over 80 percent of the student population is African American or Hispanic.
Back in Summer Creek’s main gym  as the clock ticked closer to 6 p.m.   Brabham  donned her white Kingwood jersey for warm-ups. Temporary printout photos of the Kingwood basketball team were on one wall while the permanent Summer Creek team photo was plastered to the opposite end.
But one thing that remained unchanged from before the hurricane — as the final seconds on the warm-up clock ticked off and  Brabham  tightened her ponytail — was the desire of each team to beat its rival.
“We are all in the same school  and we’ve all seen each other at some point  and it is like we are all combining  but there is always still going to be that rivalry there ”  Brabham  said. “And we want to win.”","For  [TGT] were a welcome distraction from Harvey’s fallout — destroyed homes  friends’ families starting over from scratch — and an opportunity to spend more time with  her  teammates  whom  she  considers  her  sisters.

3525,Israel hacked Kaspersky then tipped the NSA that its tools had been breached,Eugene Kaspersky,"Last month  the Department of Homeland Security instructed federal civilian agencies to identify Kaspersky Lab software on their networks and remove it on the grounds that “the risk that the Russian government  whether acting on its own or in collaboration with  Kaspersky   could capitalize on access provided by  Kaspersky  products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.” The directive followed a decision by the General Services Administration to remove  Kaspersky  from its list of approved vendors. And lawmakers on Capitol Hill are considering a governmentwide ban.
After the U.S. banned federal agencies from using Kaspersky Lab software in September  citing concerns over its ties with Russian intelligence services   Kaspersky  spokesman Anthon Shingarov called the move a “part of a geopolitical game.” (Associated Press)
 Kaspersky  said in a statement that “as a private company  Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government  including Russia  and the only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight.”  The company  said  it  “does not possess any knowledge” of Israel’s hack.
 The firm’s founder  Eugene Kaspersky   said in a blog post last week that  his  anti-virus software is supposed to find malware from all quarters.
“We absolutely and aggressively detect and clean malware infections no matter the source ”  he  wrote  suggesting that the NSA hacking tools could have been picked up as malware by the anti-virus program.
Concerns about  Kaspersky  have also emerged in the cybersecurity industry  where some officials say that the firm’s software has been used not just to protect its customers’ computers but also as a platform for espionage.

 Kaspersky  is also the only major anti-virus firm whose data is routed through Russian Internet service providers subject to Russian surveillance. That surveillance system is known as the SORM  or the System of Operative-Investigative Measures.
 The company  said that customer data flowing through  Kaspersky ’s Russian servers is encrypted and that the firm does not decrypt it for the government.
It is not publicly known how the Russians obtained the NSA hacking tools in 2015. Some information security analysts have speculated that the Russians exploited a flaw in  Kaspersky  software to filch the material.
But other experts say the Russians would not need to hack  Kaspersky ’s systems. They say that the material could be picked up through the country’s surveillance regime.
 The firm  is likely to be beholden to the Kremlin  said Steven Hall  who ran the CIA’s Russia operations for 30 years. He said that  Kaspersky ’s line of work is of particular interest to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin and that because of the way things work in Russia   Eugene Kaspersky  “knows  he ’s at the mercy of Putin.”
“The case against Kaspersky Lab is overwhelming ” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.)  a vocal critic of  Kaspersky  who has pushed to remove the company’s software from federal networks. “The strong ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are very alarming.”
“That’s the crux of the matter ” said one industry official who received the briefing. “Whether  Kaspersky  is working directly for the Russian government or not doesn’t matter; their Internet service providers are subject to monitoring. So virtually anything shared with  Kaspersky  could become the property of the Russian government.”
Late last month  the National Intelligence Council completed a classified report that it shared with NATO allies concluding that the FSB had “probable access” to  Kaspersky  customer databases and source code. That access  it concluded  could help enable cyberattacks against U.S. government  commercial and industrial control networks.","Last month  the Department of Homeland Security instructed federal civilian agencies to identify Kaspersky Lab software on their networks and remove it on the grounds that “the risk that the Russian government  whether acting on its own or in collaboration with  Kaspersky   could capitalize on access provided by  Kaspersky  products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.” The directive followed a decision by the General Services Administration to remove  Kaspersky  from its list of approved vendors.

3528,Houston pension bill moves ahead despite flaws,Sylvester Turner,"Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner  went to Austin Monday to convince lawmakers that  he  has hit upon a solution to Houston’s $8.1 billion pension problem.
 His  answer is math — really complicated but ultimately pointless math.
Last September   Turner  promised a hard cap on the city’s pension liability and a fixed 30-year repayment plan. Instead   he  has delivered a bill that would allow debt to continue to accrue and repayment to be put off indefinitely.
The city is as exposed to bankruptcy as ever  as  Turner ’s plan primarily deals with what checks get written when  not with the massive debt that continues to mount.
State Sen. Joan Huffman filed a bill last week containing  Turner ’s plan  with one addition opposed by both  Turner  and the Houston unions: a requirement that the city get voter approval before issuing $1 billion in pension obligation bonds.
 Turner  promised an end to that with the equivalent of a fixed 30-year mortgage.  He  delivered  but there’s a catch: Houston can take out second mortgages  third mortgages  and so on in perpetuity  each with a new 30-year repayment period.
And  Turner  would like to kick off this journey to solvency by putting  his  next house payment of $134 million on the credit card  so to speak.
The upside of the plan is that  Turner  has won some concessions. The police and municipal employees unions are willing to trade some of their IOUs (payable by taxpayers) for cash up front at a steep discount. The firefighters union has decided to oppose the plan  but Huffman said Monday that they “will have to be brought along kicking and screaming.”
While  Turner ’s bill achieves some concessions  it doesn’t deliver the promised features.
“We cap the city’s exposure ”  Turner  told the committee. “The bill says that the parties are obligated to come back to the table and they shall adjust their benefits to stay within the corridor ” which is a separate cap limiting the city’s pension payments to 37 percent of payroll.
 Turner  said Monday that if  he ’s not able to use a pension bond to cover a $134 million pension contribution that’s due  then “a lot of people will not be working.”
He pointed out that the plan lacks a 401k-like “defined contribution” plan for new hires. That’s one of the easy first steps that struggling localities elsewhere have taken  but which  Turner  rejects for ideological reasons.
A few experts have noticed that  Turner ’s plan  if tweaked  could be used to impose a defined contribution plan through the back door. That is  in setting a defined maximum the city will pay each year  the city could be defining its contribution. But the liability loss layers would have to be stripped from the plan.","[TGT]went to Austin Monday to convince lawmakers that  [TGT]  has hit upon a solution to Houston’s $8.1 billion pension problem.

While  [TGT] achieves some concessions  [TGT] doesn’t deliver the promised features.
“We cap the city’s exposure ”  [TGT]  told the committee. “The bill says that the parties are obligated to come back to the table and they shall adjust their benefits to stay within the corridor ” which is a separate cap limiting the city’s pension payments to 37 percent of payroll.
 [TGT]  said Monday that if  [TGT] ’s not able to use a pension bond to cover a $134 million pension contribution that’s due  then “a lot of people will not be working.”
[TGT] pointed out that the plan lacks a 401k-like “defined contribution” plan for new hires. That’s one of the easy first steps that struggling localities elsewhere have taken  but which  [TGT]  rejects for ideological reasons.
A few experts have noticed that  [TGT] ’s plan  if tweaked  could be used to impose a defined contribution plan through the back door. That is  in setting a defined maximum the city will pay each year  the city could be defining its contribution. But the liability loss layers would have to be stripped from the plan.",Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,,,

3530,Jimmy Butler downplays Friday's Timberwolves,Zach LaVine,"Jimmy Butler told reporters after the Timberwolves’ loss in overtime Wednesday in Cleveland that Friday night will be just another game.  Zach LaVine  doesn’t agree.
“Of course it means a little bit extra ”  LaVine  said.
 LaVine   along with Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen  is one of the faces of the Bulls’ rebuild. Butler  with his indefatigable  two-way  All-Star talent  is the piece that has pushed the Timberwolves into playoff contention  which would end a 13-season drought.
“I didn’t care ”  LaVine  said about the widespread public reaction. “I know what I can do and what I bring to the table. So I hold up my end of the bargain and public eye doesn’t really affect real basketball people.
“I’m going to be  the best Zach LaVine ; that’s who I am. I’m not here to replace anybody but to become the next young guy for the Chicago Bulls  work my butt off and take this back to where it should be. You can’t replace a guy when you’re not that person. I’m  Zach LaVine . I’m going to play like me  act like me. That’s just how I carry myself.”
 LaVine  had nothing but positive memories from  his  time and relationships formed with the Timberwolves. Former teammates like Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins reached out to  him  when  he  returned from ACL rehab. And  he  still remembers the late Flip Saunders handing  him  a slip of paper to emphasize the bond  he  would be a part of as the team’s young core.

LIMA  Peru — The Latest on Pope Francis’ visit to Peru (all times local):
The American cardinal who publicly rebuked  Pope Francis  over  his  remarks about Chilean sex abuse victims is concelebrating Francis’ final Mass in Peru.
O’Malley publicly rebuked  Francis  on Saturday for accusing victims of Chile’s most notorious pedophile priest of slandering another bishop with their claims.
 Francis  is likely to face questions about the issue on  his  in-flight news conference while returning to Rome.
 Pope Francis  is telling young Peruvians that God loves them as they are and there’s no need to “Photoshop” their hearts to make them seem perfect.
At a noon prayer from Lima’s Plaza de Armas   Francis  sought to speak to young people in their own language in encouraging them in their faith.
 Francis  is known for  his  blunt speaking style. Earlier Sunday  he  told Peruvian bishops they need to speak the language of young people to help them understand the message of the Gospel  just as Roman Catholic missionaries learned the languages of indigenous peoples as they worked to convert them.
 Pope Francis  is demanding that Congo authorities do everything in their power to avoid violence amid deadly anti-government demonstrations.
 Francis  made the appeal from the Peruvian capital  where  he  led thousands of young people in prayer.
 He  said of Congo: “I ask the authorities and those responsible and all those in this beloved country that they use maximum commitment and effort to avoid all forms of violence and look for solutions in favor of the common good.”
 Pope Francis  says the sprawling Odebrecht bribery scandal that has rippled across Latin America is “just a small anecdote” in a scourge of corruption throughout the region.
 Francis  said Sunday in remarks to bishops in Peru that politics in much of Latin America is in a state of “crisis” because of graft.
The controversy over Pope Francis’ accusations of slander against victims of Chile’s most notorious pedophile priest has followed him to Peru.
In Chile   Francis  accused victims of the country’s most notorious sexual abuser  the Rev. Fernando Karadima  of slandering another bishop by saying he knew of Karadima’s abuse but did nothing.  Francis  said there was “not one shred of proof” implicating the bishop and that the accusations against him were “calumny.”
 Pope Francis  has had a special group of visitors call on  him  at the Vatican’s residence in Peru: four prisoners who were released for a brief spell to greet  him .","[TGT] arrives to celebrate Mass at the Las Palmas Air Force base in Lima  Peru  Sunday  Jan. 21  2018.

3537,Disabled Florida inmate was gassed to death after begging for medical help lawsuit says,Randall Jordan-Aparo,"Randall Jordan-Aparo  spent four days begging for medical help.  He  suffered from a severe blood disorder and was showing signs of a dangerous flare-up: rapid heart beat  fever and debilitating bodily pain.  He  needed to go to a hospital   he  said.
In a matter of hours  guards found  Jordan-Aparo  dead on the floor of  his  cell  covered in orange residue. There was a Bible nearby  and he was positioned near the crack under his door  as if he were struggling for fresh air  according to the Miami Herald.
 Jordan-Aparo’s  death in September 2010 became the subject of multiple probes  including an inquiry by the FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. A federal grand jury returned no indictments.
But a federal lawsuit by  Jordan-Aparo’s  family is underway  and they recently won a key victory in the case.
The lawsuit was brought by Jordan-Aparo’s 12-year-old daughter  who was 6 when he died  and her mother. It describes  Jordan-Aparo  as an orphan who was adopted after  his  biological parents committed suicide together when  he  was 5 years old.  He  had a criminal history of nonviolent crimes that included drug possession.
 Jordan-Aparo  was sent to the Franklin Correctional Institution in northwest Florida in October 2009.  He  had pleaded guilty to credit card fraud and was set to serve a 20-month sentence.  He  was a minimum security prisoner  set to be released in early 2011.
 His  disability  Osler-Weber-Rendu disease  is a genetic disorder that causes people to develop abnormal blood vessels  which can lead to anemia  severe bleeding and pulmonary complications.
On Sept. 15  2010   he  went to the prison infirmary with pain in  his  back and  his  side. Nurses recorded a body temperature of 102.4 degrees. The lawsuit says  he  had a “serious infection” caused by  his  disease.
Medical staff “ordered bedrest and Tylenol” and sent  him  back to  his  cell  according to the complaint.
Two days later   he  went back to the infirmary  the pain on  his  left side so bad that  he  couldn’t give a urine sample. It was a “medical emergency ”  he  said. Drink more water  a nurse told  him .
“The medical services provided to  Aparo  were objectively insufficient ” it adds. “This is a deliberately indifferent and reckless disregard for the treatment of  Aparo ’s medical needs and disability.”
Later that night  he reported to the infirmary two more times. His heart rate had soared above 100 beats per minute and he was having trouble breathing. An inmate told a correctional officer that  Jordan-Aparo  was so sick he had passed out on a toilet and pleaded to go to a hospital  according to the complaint. Prison workers again sent him to a disciplinary dorm for threatening to sue a nurse if he wasn’t taken to a hospital.
The lawsuit says he was murdered  and accuses prison workers of wrongful death. The alleged motive:  Jordan-Aparo  had been an informant against guards at another prison. Additionally   it  alleges conspiracy  violation of  his  constitutional rights  and violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act.

3541,Trump says 'I'm not a racist ' keeps door open for DACA deal,REUTERSKevin Lamarque Trump,"WEST PALM BEACH  Fla. (Reuters) -  U.S. President Donald Trump  insisted on Sunday “I‘m not a racist” in response to reports that  he  had described immigrants from Haiti and African countries as coming from “shithole countries.”
 Trump  also said  he  was “ready  willing and able” to reach a deal to protect illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children from being deported but that  he  did not believe Democrats wanted an agreement.  He  tweeted earlier on Sunday that the existing program would “probably” be discontinued.
The comments led to harsh recriminations from Democrats and Republicans alike  with some critics accusing  Trump  of racism  even as bipartisan talks continued in the U.S. Congress to seek a bipartisan compromise to salvage the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  or DACA.
Asked by a reporter in Florida whether he was a racist   Trump  said: “No. I‘m not a racist. I‘m the least racist person you have ever interviewed.”
 Trump  has threatened to end DACA  but he seemed to keep the door open for a deal when he told reporters before dinner on Sunday night: “We’re ready  willing and able to make a deal on DACA  but I don’t think the Democrats want to make a deal…. The Democrats are the ones that aren’t going to make a deal.”
Love  whose parents are from Haiti  had criticized  Trump  for his remarks and called on him to apologize.

One participant at the meeting on Sunday denied that  Trump  used the term and another said  he  did not recall  Trump  making such comments.
Asked on Sunday whether  his  inflammatory remarks made it harder to get a DACA deal   Trump  said: “Did you see what various senators in the room say about my comments? They weren’t bad.”
One of Trump’s top advisers  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  said on “Fox News Sunday” she did not recall if  Trump  used “that specific phrase.”

3546,This Woman Pays Drug Addicts To Get Sterilized,Barbara Harris,"As 2017 came to a close  Vice News profiled a woman named Barbara Harris  whose organization pays drug addicts to get themselves sterilized or have an IUD implanted.
Traveling the country in her branded RV   Harris  thinks of herself as a crusader for the many unfortunate children born into a miserable life with drug addicted parents. Indeed  many of the women whom  Harris  works with have as many as seven children  despite being addicted to heroine  meth  cocaine or crack.
""Nothing positive comes to a drug addict who gives birth to eight children that are taken away from her. This is a win-win for everybody ""  Harris  says of  her  operation.
Having operated for over 20 years and receiving millions in donations   Harris  has now paid for the sterilization and long-term birth control of roughly 7 000 people  a majority of whom are black women.  She  began  her  operation after adopting four children who were all born from the same drug-addicted mother.
 Harris ' moral reasoning is purely Machiavellian. In  her  mind  the ends justify the means because sterilization means fewer babies will be born into an unfortunate situation  some of whom suffer severe birth defects. ""I think if there's anything that everyone can agree on ... It's that it's not okay to abuse children ""  Harris  says in justifying  her  practice.
One prevention that  Harris  (as well as many misguided Libertarians) disagrees with is sending hard drug users to jail  as in the case of one woman who was prosecuted for taking drugs while pregnant.","As 2017 came to a close  Vice News profiled a woman named [TGT]  whose organization pays drug addicts to get themselves sterilized or have an IUD implanted.

 Anthony  is still a devastating scorer  but physically  he  is no longer the leading man to carry a team. As if four straight non-playoff years in New York isn’t enough evidence  look at what the Knicks received from Oklahoma City on Saturday in return for their best player: Enes Kanter  Doug McDermott and a second-round pick.

Once Anthony agreed in June that it was time to leave the Knicks  they knew they couldn’t proceed with him.

For example  OKC was scouting  Anthony  as far back as January. Thunder assistant GM Troy Weaver recruited  Anthony  to Syracuse and the two have remained close. Presti thought that relationship could help. He was right. That’s called due diligence.
Assuming Westbrook re-signs   Anthony  won’t have the pressure of needing to score 25 points a night to give his team a chance to win. He’ll face fewer double teams and he’ll be embraced by a franchise that is big on culture and treating its players like family.

3551,Keillor: Relationship with accuser simply 'romantic writing',Garrison Keillor,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) —  Garrison Keillor  described several sexually suggestive emails he exchanged with a former researcher who accused him of sexual misconduct as ""romantic writing"" that never resulted in a physical relationship  and the radio host rejected the idea that because he was  her  boss — and the driving force of a hugely popular radio program — it could be sexual harassment.
 The woman  responded  via  her  attorney  that  Keillor 's power over  her  job made  her  afraid to say no to him.
In one of his first extended interviews since Minnesota Public Radio cut ties over the allegations against the former ""A Prairie Home Companion"" host in November   Keillor  said he never had a sexual relationship with the woman  a freelance contributor to the show at the time.
""No button was unbuttoned and no zipper was unzipped ""  Keillor  told The Associated Press. ""I never kissed  her  ... This was a flirtation between two writers that took place in writing.""
 Keillor  also downplayed his power over  the woman  by portraying himself as uninvolved in the mundane operations of the radio show he created nearly a half-century ago and built into a powerhouse that attracted millions of listeners nationwide each Saturday evening  spun off assorted businesses and tours and inspired a movie.
""I was not really the boss around 'Prairie Home Companion '""  Keillor  said. ""I was a writer sitting in a dim office at a typewriter  back in the old days."" He also said: ""I had no control over her whatsoever. She worked at home.""
The woman said in an emailed response through her attorney that  Keillor  ""had the power to provide or take away job assignments and opportunities. He also acknowledged several times that power imbalance between us  recognizing how his conduct could be offensive when it was coming from the person for whom I work.""
She also said she wasn't interested in anything but a ""collegial"" relationship with  Keillor .
MPR spokeswoman Angie Andresen said the station stands by its handling of the claims against  Keillor . In January  the company said the woman had accused  Keillor  of dozens of sexually inappropriate incidents over several years  including requests for sexual contact and explicit sexual communications and touching.
Prior to the interview   Keillor 's attorneys allowed the AP to view hundreds of emails between  Keillor  and the woman dating from 2004 to 2017  on condition that they could be described but not quoted directly.
Some were work-related  including details from her research and  Keillor 's critiques. But many were personal  sharing details about their families and emotional struggles from their home email accounts  and some were overtly sexual.
The tone began changing in 2013  as the pair began sharing more about their lives and signing off by saying they loved and missed each other. By 2014 and 2015  the emails became more amorous. They both shared wishes or fantasies of being intimate  sometimes in detail. In one July 20  2015  email   Keillor  wrote of his desire to reach into the woman's blouse and hold her breast in his hand.  Keillor  was married at the time and still is.
""I agree that there are adolescent passages in there  but there were some by her and some by me  "" Keillor  told the AP.
 Keillor  also wrote about wanting to touch the woman  kiss her  or be naked with her on several occasions. She replied in kind. The emails also included some explicit acknowledgements by  Keillor  of their work relationship  with him apologizing for some of the emails and noting that he was the person she worked for — but that he didn't feel like her boss.
When MPR cut ties with  Keillor  in November  his public statement at the time acknowledged one incident -- placing his hand on a woman's bare back in what he portrayed as an accident. He said then it was the only incident he could remember.
MPR has removed archived  Keillor  shows from its website and no longer rebroadcasts shows he hosted. It also ended broadcasts of ""The Writer's Almanac "" his daily reading of literary events and a poem.

Most people assumed that the only way  Robert Mugabe  would give up being president was to die in  his  bed.  He  probably thought so too.
The man who seems about to take his place  Emmerson Mnangagwa  was deeply involved in most of those crimes  yet people in  Zimbabwe   like the outside world  will be so relieved to see Mr Mugabe go that they will be tempted to forget all that.
They'll also forget the few unquestionably good things Robert Mugabe did.  Zimbabwe   for instance  has an extraordinarily high literacy rate  because of him. But that's certainly not what he'll be remembered for.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Mr Mugabe's resignation ""provides  Zimbabwe  with an opportunity to forge a new path free of the oppression that characterised his rule"".
She said that former colonial power Britain  ""as  Zimbabwe 's oldest friend""  will do all it can to support free and fair elections and the rebuilding of the Zimbabwean economy.
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC he hoped that  Zimbabwe  was on a ""new trajectory"" that would include free and fair elections. He said Mr Mugabe should be allowed to ""go and rest for his last days"".
 Robert Mugabe  won elections during  his  37 years in power  but over the past 15 years these were marred by violence against political opponents.
 He  presided over a deepening economic crisis in Zimbabwe  where people are on average 15% poorer now than they were in 1980.

3553,John Kelly Speaks About Fallen Soldiers: Read the Transcript,Bush,"Typically  the only phone calls a family receives are the most important phone calls they could imagine  and that is from their buddies. In my case  hours after my son was killed  his friends were calling  us  from Afghanistan  telling  us  what a great guy he was. Those are the only phone calls that really mattered.
He asked me about previous Presidents  and I said  I can tell you that President Obama  who was my Commander-in-Chief when I was on active duty  did not call my family. That was not a criticism. That was just to simply say  I don’t believe President Obama called. That’s not a negative thing. I don’t believe  President Bush  called in all cases. I don’t believe any President  particularly when the casualty rates are very  very high — that Presidents call. But I believe they all write.
So when I gave that explanation to  our President  three days ago   he  elected to make phone calls in the cases of four young men who we lost in Niger at the earlier part of this month. But then  he  said  how do you make these calls? If you’re not in the family  if you’ve never worn the uniform  if you’ve never been in combat  you can’t even imagine how to make that call.

The call in question that  he  made yesterday — or day before yesterday now — were to four family members  the four fallen. And remember  there’s a next-of-kin designated by the individual. If he’s married  that’s typically the spouse. If he’s not married  that’s typically the parents unless the parents are divorced  and then he selects one of them. If he didn’t get along with his parents  he’ll select a sibling. But the point is  the phone call is made to the next-of-kin only if the next-of-kin agrees to take the phone call.

 Manafort ’s defense argued in a court filing to a federal judge in Washington that  Manafort ’s work on the op-ed piece for an English-language newspaper in Kiev defending himself did not violate a court gag order because it would not likely bias potential jurors in any U.S. trial.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson had ordered  Manafort  to respond by Thursday to Monday’s allegation that he had violated the gag order. Prosecutors cited the purported violation as a reason for pulling out of a proposed joint bail deal that would release  Manafort  from home detention and GPS monitoring as he awaits trial on charges of money laundering  fraud and failing to register as a foreign agent when he worked as a consultant to a Ukrainian political party.
Prosecutors argued that  Manafort  defended  his  work advising a Russia-friendly political party in Ukraine in the opinion piece  he  ghostwrote with an unidentified person they say was a longtime Russian colleague assessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service.

[Prosecutors say longtime  Manafort  colleague has ‘ties’ to Russian intelligence]
 Manafort’s  defense team said the piece  posted online Thursday by the Kyiv Post  was written by Oleg Voloshyn  a Ukrainian political commentator and former Foreign Ministry spokesman  as Voloshyn also told The Washington Post earlier this week.
Earlier  prosecutor Andrew Weissmann had argued that  Manafort ’s work on the editorial “clearly was undertaken to influence the public’s opinion of  defendant Manafort  ” saying there would be no other reason for  Manafort  and the colleague to have  it  published under someone else’s name.
Manafort and Kilimnik were in close contact during the months that  Manafort  ran Trump’s campaign. They met twice in person  including an August 2016 dinner in New York City where Kilimnik has said their conversation included discussion of the presidential campaign.
For a decade   Manafort  and Kilimnik worked with then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych  who was initially considered pro-Western but eventually became allied with Russian interests.
Voloshyn argued in the editorial that  Manafort  favored Ukraine’s integration with Europe and had opposed Russia’s interests.
Kilimnik also served as  Manafort ’s liaison to Oleg Deripaska  an aluminum magnate and ally to Russian President Vladi­mir Putin who employed Manafort as an investment consultant.
According to emails described to The Post   Manafort  directed Kilimnik to offer Deripaska “private briefings” about Trump’s campaign. A Deripaska spokeswoman has said he was never offered such briefings.

3556,Special Counsel Prosecutors Say They've Found New Evidence Of Criminal Activity By Paul Manafort,Paul Manafort,"Special counsel prosecutors  say  they  have uncovered new evidence of alleged criminal activity by  former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort   according to a newly unsealed court filing Friday evening.
Lawyers from special counsel Robert Mueller's office wrote that they had learned new information about  Manafort  since the judge first ruled on a bail package that would allow him to leave home confinement  and were opposing  Manafort 's bid to modify those terms of release.
""That criminal conduct includes a series of bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies "" prosecutors wrote  including criminal conduct related to the mortgage on one of the properties that  Manafort  said  he  would agree to forfeit if  he  failed to show up to court.
Bank fraud was not part of the indictment returned by a federal grand jury against  Manafort  and  his  longtime associate and former senior Trump campaign official Rick Gates in late October. As of Friday evening  no new charges had been filed against  Manafort or Gates  on the public docket. Prosecutors wrote in the redacted document made public on Friday that they were prepared to present the new evidence they had found at a future bail hearing for  Manafort .
Manafort and Gates were charged with conspiracy to launder money  failing to report overseas bank accounts  failing to register as agents for foreign entities  and making false statements. Both pleaded not guilty  and  Manafort  has sued the Justice Department and Mueller  challenging the validity of Mueller's appointment as special counsel.
Since the indictment  the case has been tied up in fights over  Manafort  and Gates' conditions of release. They were both placed under home confinement at their first court appearance on Oct. 30  and spent the following months trying to have that house arrest lifted.
US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled in mid-December that  Manafort  could go free if he met certain conditions  including agreeing to forfeit four properties if he failed to come to court  and living in Florida  abiding by an 11 p.m. curfew  and needing the judge's approval to travel elsewhere in the United States. But  Manafort  did not file the required paperwork to fulfill the judge's order  and on Friday filed a redacted version of a request he originally filed under seal dated Feb. 9 seeking to modify the judge's conditions.
 Manafort 's new request proposed putting up several different real estate properties  which  he  said were jointly valued at $10.05 million  and living in Alexandria  Virginia  instead of Florida. Jackson's December order required Manafort's wife and daughter to serve as sureties and certify that they had $7 million in cash or securities on hand in case the value of the real estate was less than $10 million  but  Manafort  in  his  new proposal asked to remove the surety requirement.
 Manafort 's latest proposal prompted a response from Mueller's team  which was filed with the court on Feb. 13 but not made public until Friday night. Prosecutors said  Manafort 's new bail proposal was worth less than $10 million  and warned that they had uncovered evidence that  Manafort  secured a mortgage for one of the properties ""through a series of false and fraudulent representations"" to the bank. They alleged that in 2015 and 2016  Manafort ""provided the bank with doctored profit and loss statements"" for his company  DMP International LLC  which overstated its income by ""millions of dollars.""
On the removal of the surety requirement  prosecutors wrote that  ""The fact that  Manafort  has not been able to find any responsible surety to cosign a bond for this package suggests that neither those closest to  him   nor anyone else  is willing to assume the risk of being a surety for  him .""
Manafort's lawyer Kevin Downing did not immediately return a request for comment  and a spokesman for  Manafort  declined to comment.  Jackson  has ordered  Manafort  and Gates  their defense lawyers  and the prosecutors not to make public statements that could prejudice the case.
In a separate filing late Friday in  Manafort 's civil suit challenging the special counsel appointment  his lawyers said they brought the case ""shortly after and in direct response to the Special Counsel’s threats to bring additional charges against Mr. Manafort in venues outside the District of Columbia."" The filing didn't provide details on what exactly prosecutors may have told Manafort about the possibility of other charges in other courts.","Special counsel prosecutors  say  they  have uncovered new evidence of alleged criminal activity by  former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort   according to a newly unsealed court filing Friday evening.

Prosecutors wrote in the redacted document made public on Friday that they were prepared to present the new evidence they had found at a future bail hearing for  Manafort .
[TGT] and Gates were charged with conspiracy to launder money  failing to report overseas bank accounts  failing to register as agents for foreign entities  and making false statements. Both pleaded not guilty  and  [TGT]has sued the Justice Department and Mueller  challenging the validity of Mueller's appointment as special counsel.
Since the indictment  the case has been tied up in fights over  Manafort  and Gates' conditions of release. They were both placed under home confinement at their first court appearance on Oct. 30  and spent the following months trying to have that house arrest lifted.
US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled in mid-December that  [TGT]could go free if he met certain conditions  including agreeing to forfeit four properties if he failed to come to court  and living in Florida  abiding by an 11 p.m. curfew  and needing the judge's approval to travel elsewhere in the United States. But  [TGT]did not file the required paperwork to fulfill the judge's order  and on Friday filed a redacted version of a request he originally filed under seal dated Feb. 9 seeking to modify the judge's conditions.
 [TGT] 's new request proposed putting up several different real estate properties  which  [TGT]  said were jointly valued at $10.05 million  and living in Alexandria  Virginia  instead of Florida. Jackson's December order required Manafort's wife and daughter to serve as sureties and certify that they had $7 million in cash or securities on hand in case the value of the real estate was less than $10 million  but  Manafort  in  his  new proposal asked to remove the surety requirement.
 [TGT] 's latest proposal prompted a response from Mueller's team  which was filed with the court on Feb. 13 but not made public until Friday night. Prosecutors said  Manafort 's new bail proposal was worth less than $10 million  and warned that they had uncovered evidence that  Manafort  secured a mortgage for one of the properties ""through a series of false and fraudulent representations"" to the bank. They alleged that in 2015 and 2016  Manafort ""provided the bank with doctored profit and loss statements"" for his company  DMP International LLC  which overstated its income by ""millions of dollars.""
On the removal of the surety requirement  prosecutors wrote that  ""The fact that  Manafort  has not been able to find any responsible surety to cosign a bond for this package suggests that neither those closest to  him   nor anyone else  is willing to assume the risk of being a surety for  him .""
Manafort's lawyer Kevin Downing did not immediately return a request for comment  and a spokesman for  Manafort  declined to comment.  Jackson  has ordered  Manafort  and Gates  their defense lawyers  and the prosecutors not to make public statements that could prejudice the case.
In a separate filing late Friday in  Manafort 's civil suit challenging the special counsel appointment  his lawyers said they brought the case ""shortly after and in direct response to the Special Counsel’s threats to bring additional charges against Mr. Manafort in venues outside the District of Columbia."" The filing didn't provide details on what exactly prosecutors may have told Manafort about the possibility of other charges in other courts.",Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,,,,
3557,South Africa ANC vote too close to call markets on edge,Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma,"As officials counted ballots in the leadership vote  senior party members drew battle lines on social media  backing either Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa or Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma - a former cabinet minister and the ex-wife of President Jacob Zuma.
The vote is perhaps the most pivotal moment for the ANC since it launched black-majority rule under Nelson Mandela’s leadership 23 years ago.  Zuma ’s presidency  tainted by graft accusations that  he  denies  has tarnished the party’s image and raised the prospect of splits.
“Before today we said  Dlamini-Zuma  could emerge as a winner. Even if there is a strong lead in terms of branch nominations by the Ramaphosa camp  it’s not clear-cut.”
In  his  last speech as ANC president on  Saturday  Zuma  announced plans to raise subsidies for tertiary colleges and universities  a move analysts said was timed to appeal to the party’s more populist members allied to Dlamini-Zuma  the first woman nominated as an ANC presidential candidate.
 Zuma  has faced allegations of corruption since  he  became head of state in 2009 but has denied any wrongdoing.
On Monday   Zuma  visited a part of the conference where businesses and charitable foundations had set up stands.

3558,A 20,Hisham Salama,"There are expensive Uber rides (thanks  surge pricing)  and then there is the fare  Hisham Salama  of Toronto was charged Friday night.
 Salama  went to visit a friend in the hospital — about a 20 minute drive. When  he  got  his  receipt on the app  however   he  found that drive cost  him  $18 518  or more than $900 per minute on the road.
 Salama  did what anyone in  his  position would have done (besides pass out in shock).  He  contacted Uber support to get a solution to what was surely a mistake.
Here’s the response  he  received from Uber:
@Uber @Uber_Support what turned out to be an honest mistake is now turning into the biggest blunder of 2017. I’m no longer laughing at wondering when #uber will get their act together. Can anyone help? Obviously  no 20 min fare is $18 500.  pic.twitter.com/zBhtMSBy67 — Hisham Salama (@The_Hish) December 9  2017
 In the end   he  got a refund for the original fare  and a $150 credit to  his  account.
 Salama  told Vice News that the manager  he  spoke to said the first support representative “was confused with the trip and issue.”
For reference on just how ridiculous  Salama ’s fare was  some of the highest fares come during New Year’s Eve.
One user recorded a fare of $1 114.71 for a ride of relatively short distance that took an hour because of traffic. The surge pricing on that ride was x8.9.

Nathan Rousseau Smith (@FantasticMrNate) has the story. Buzz60
Harvey Weinstein in 2016. (Photo: Richard Shotwell  Invision/AP)
Of the many horrifying and shocking details in Tuesday's The New Yorker report that  movie mogul Harvey Weinstein  allegedly raped  sexually assaulted and sexually harassed more than a dozen women  one that sticks out is a quote from French actress Emma de Caunes  who said  Weinstein  exposed  himself  to her in a hotel room in 2010.
The magazine's searing investigation into Weinstein's alleged sexual predation comes only five days after The New York Times published a meticulous account that detailed three decades of alleged sexual harassment and abuse. The Times published another report on Tuesday  in which Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie accused  Weinstein  of harassment.
It's an indictment of  Weinstein   who has since been fired from  his  own company and denounced by dozens of A-list stars and filmmakers who have worked with  him . But it's also an indictment of the Hollywood culture that allowed  Weinstein 's abuses to continue for nearly 30 years  seemingly unabated. ""Even in an industry in which sexual harassment has long persisted  Mr. Weinstein stands out "" the Times noted.
The issue isn't isolated to  Weinstein  or the film industry. This happens in every industry  in social circles  in public spaces. Keeping track of just the famous male figures at the center of these allegations is downright exhausting.
Much has been said in the past few days of the “whisper networks” by which women communicate to protect themselves  including the one that made at least part of  Weinstein 's behavior common knowledge. Some have asked why no woman has spoken on the record about  Weinstein 's behavior before now. That's the wrong question. It's not the whispers we should be focusing on  but the deafening silence of bystanders and enablers. It's the culture — both within and beyond Hollywood — dominated by toxic masculinity that ignored  Weinstein 's problematic behavior  that let rumor remain rumor  and that endangers women everywhere if it's not curtailed.
Also: Everything you need to know about Harvey Weinstein’s downfall
The list of men in Hollywood who have been accused of sexual misconduct  harassment or assault gets longer all the time. Woody Allen. Bill Cosby. Roman Polanski. Casey Affleck and Louis C.K. have been accused of misconduct. The broader film community also has been rocked by allegations against prominent film bloggers Devin Faraci and Harry Knowles and “Honest Trailers” creator Andy Signore.  The Los Angeles art house cinema Cinefamily  suspended operations after accusations surfaced.
 We  know  Harvey Weinstein  isn’t the only one  but how many predators are left that  we  don’t know about? Accusers risk their livelihoods and further harassment by speaking out. Some don't understand what has happened. Others are told to get used to it  to ""be cool"" or ""take a joke.""

3565,Gen. John Kelly comes out to defend a coward,John Kelly,"The photo of a young Army widow clutching the flag-draped casket of  her  husband is haunting. Myeshia Johnson’s pain seemed to run so deep that it pierced  her  soul.
 She  had been called upon to perform a duty that only the truest of American patriots  our Gold Star families  must do — claim the body of a fallen soldier upon his return home.
 White House Chief of Staff John Kelly  would have us forget about Johnson’s grief and reserve our empathy for Trump.
In a rare appearance before the news media on Thursday   Kelly  reminded us that the president is  after all  inexperienced in making condolence calls to Gold Star families.
 Kelly  implored Americans to understand how difficult it was for someone who has never worn the uniform  who has never been in combat  to make such a call. Some presidents send a letter instead   he  said. But Trump chose to call.
Our president is incapable of speaking from the heart  though. So  Kelly   a retired four-star general who lost his own son in Afghanistan  stood by the president’s side and fed the words to him.
The problem wasn’t what Trump said to the grieving widow   Kelly  intimated. It was the fact that a Florida congresswoman  an “empty barrel” as he referred to  her   spoke out about it.
 Kelly  revealed during the news conference  albeit unintentionally  that Trump had lied. What Wilson said was true. Trump had repeated in the telephone call exactly what  Kelly  had told him to say.
The fact that he works for a man who is both a coward and a liar is not what concerns  Kelly   though.  He  is most troubled that details of the telephone conversation got out.
 Kelly  said  he  is stunned that the things that were sacred in our country when  he  was growing up are no longer sacred. Most Americans are stunned  too.
“Women were sacred  looked upon with great honor ”  Kelly  said. “But that’s obviously not the case anymore.”
 He  could have added that  his  boss  the president of the United States  has contributed immensely to the growing irreverence for women.
Religion seems to be gone as well   Kelly  said. He should have pointed out that no president ever has been so determined to undermine religious freedom in America as Trump.
As for the sanctity of Gold Star families  “that left in the convention over the summer ”  Kelly  said.
Analysis:  Kelly  might not be like Trump  but  he  seems like many Trump voters »
 Kelly  did not mention Trump’s brutal verbal attack on the parents of Capt. Humayun Khan after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention. But we remember Trump's attack on the Muslim-American family well. His vile  disrespectful verbiage directed at the Khans was an affront to every military family that has lost a loved one.","The photo of a young Army widow clutching the flag-draped casket of  her  husband is haunting. Myeshia Johnson’s pain seemed to run so deep that it pierced  her  soul.
 She  had been called upon to perform a duty that only the truest of American patriots  our Gold Star families  must do — claim the body of a fallen soldier upon his return home.
 [TGT]would have us forget about Johnson’s grief and reserve our empathy for Trump.
In a rare appearance before the news media on Thursday   [TGT]reminded us that the president is  after all  inexperienced in making condolence calls to Gold Star families.
 [TGT]implored Americans to understand how difficult it was for someone who has never worn the uniform  who has never been in combat  to make such a call. Some presidents send a letter instead   he  said. But Trump chose to call.
Our president is incapable of speaking from the heart  though. So  [TGT]a retired four-star general who lost [TGT] own son in Afghanistan  stood by the president’s side and fed the words to him.
The problem wasn’t what Trump said to the grieving widow   [TGT]intimated. It was the fact that a Florida congresswoman  an “empty barrel” as he referred to  her   spoke out about it.
 [TGT]revealed during the news conference  albeit unintentionally  that Trump had lied. What Wilson said was true. Trump had repeated in the telephone call exactly what  [TGT]had told him to say.
The fact that he works for a man who is both a coward and a liar is not what concerns  Kelly   though.  He  is most troubled that details of the telephone conversation got out.
 [TGT]said  [TGT]  is stunned that the things that were sacred in our country when  [TGT]  was growing up are no longer sacred. Most Americans are stunned  too.
“Women were sacred  looked upon with great honor ”  [TGT]said. “But that’s obviously not the case anymore.”
 He  could have added that  his  boss  the president of the United States  has contributed immensely to the growing irreverence for women.
Religion seems to be gone as well   [TGT]said. [TGT] should have pointed out that no president ever has been so determined to undermine religious freedom in America as Trump.
As for the sanctity of Gold Star families  “that left in the convention over the summer ”  [TGT]said.
Analysis:  [TGT]might not be like Trump  but  [TGT]  seems like many Trump voters »
 Kelly  did not mention Trump’s brutal verbal attack on the parents of Capt. Humayun Khan after they appeared at the Democratic National Convention.

3566,Las Vegas gunman's girlfriend says no advance knowledge of massacre,Marilou Danley,"Marilou Danley  who returned late on Tuesday from a family visit to the Philippines and is regarded by investigators as a “person of interest ”  said through a lawyer that the carnage Stephen Paddock unleashed while she was abroad caught her completely unaware.
“ He  never said anything to  me  or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen ” Danley  62  said in a written statement read to reporters by her attorney in Los Angeles  where the FBI was questioning her.

In her statement after being questioned in Los Angeles  Paddock’s girlfriend  Danley  insisted she knew Paddock as “a kind  caring  quiet man.”
“It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.” Her lawyer  Matt Lombard  said  Danley  was “fully cooperating” with the investigation.
 Danley   an Australian citizen of Filipino heritage  said  she  flew back to the United States voluntarily “because I know that the FBI and Las Vegas Police Department wanted to talk to me  and I wanted to talk to them.”
Danley  who was twice married before  her  relationship with Paddock  became a focus of the investigation for having shared his retirement community condo in Mesquite  Nevada  northeast of Las Vegas  before leaving the United States for the Philippines in mid-September.
 Danley  said Paddock had bought her an airline ticket to visit her family and wired her money to purchase property there  leading her to worry  he  might be planning to break up with her.
Paddock’s brother Eric told reporters the $100 000 transfer was evidence that “Steve took care of the people  he  loved ” and that  he  likely wanted to protect Danley by sending her overseas before the attack.","[TGT]  who returned late on Tuesday from a family visit to the Philippines and is regarded by investigators as a “person of interest ”  said through a lawyer that the carnage Stephen Paddock unleashed while she was abroad caught her completely unaware.

3568,NRA Head Wayne LaPierre 's CPAC Speech Sounded Like Trump,Wayne LaPierre,"It was to be expected that  Wayne LaPierre   the Executive Vice President of the National Rifle Association (NRA)  would talk about guns and the importance of the Second Amendment during  his  speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Thursday. But  LaPierre  also fiercely criticized institutions like the FBI and the mainstream media — and did so using rhetoric that  at times  sounded a lot like President Donald Trump.
“Every day young children are being dropped off at schools that are virtually wide open soft targets for anyone bent on mass murder ”  LaPierre  said during  his  CPAC speech Thursday. “It should not be easier for a madman to shoot up a school than a bank or a jewelry store or some Hollywood gala. Schools must be the most hardened target in this country and evil must be confronted immediately with all necessary force to protect our kids.”
While it has long been the NRA’s position that there should be more guns in schools to guard against mass shootings — “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun” is a talking point  LaPierre  has used for years —  LaPierre  followed Trump’s lead during  his  CPAC speech  fiercely criticizing the FBI for the Florida shooting. The FBI has acknowledged it failed to properly investigate a tip about alleged shooter Nikolas Cruz.
Trump’s and  LaPierre ’s attacks on Thursday also extended to the mainstream news media  long a favorite foil of conservatives – and perhaps Trump more so than anyone. Just as the President has dismissed stories and even entire news outlets whose coverage is unfavorable to him as “fake news ”  LaPierre  lamented that coverage of the Second Amendment and gun control issues is unfairly skewed  saying journalists “hate the NRA” and are “eager to smear” the organization. Speaking at the NRA’s annual meeting last year   LaPierre  said the media was constructing a “calculated campaign to destroy honest truth… to dictate how we should think  how we should feel  or how we should act.”
And despite whatever daylight may open in the days ahead between Trump   LaPierre  and the NRA — on strengthening background checks  raising age requirements for gun purchases  and how exactly to change the rules around “bump stocks” — they agree on something else: that the NRA cares.
“What many people don’t understand  or don’t want to understand  is that Wayne [ LaPierre ] Chris [Cox] and the folks who work so hard at the NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots ” Trump said Thursday morning on Twitter. “They love our Country and will do the right thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
Just hours later   LaPierre  declared of gun control advocates during  his  CPAC speech: “They don’t care if their laws work or not ”  he  added.

 Pope Francis'  trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh on Monday comes as the region confronts turbulent times  not least because of the festering Rohingya crisis.

""My full closeness to our persecuted Rohingya brothers and sisters ""  he  said.

3572,Female Democratic Senators Lead Call For Al Franken To Resign,Al Franken,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) officially lost the support of many of  his  colleagues Wednesday  when more than 20 Democratic senators and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee called on  him  to step down amid multiple sexual misconduct allegations  including groping and kissing women without their consent.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)  who has been a leader on raising awareness about the epidemic of sexual misconduct  was the first to call on  Franken  to go.
“I have been shocked and disappointed to learn over the last few weeks that a colleague I am fond of personally has engaged in behavior towards women that is unacceptable ” she said in a Facebook post. “I consider  Senator Franken  to be a friend and have enjoyed working with  him  in the Senate in our shared fight to help American families. But this moment of reckoning about our friends and colleagues who have been accused of sexual misconduct is necessary  and it is painful. We must not lose sight that this watershed moment is bigger than any one industry  any one party  or any one person.”

3573,Mohammed Dahlan speaks about Palestinian unity and his back,Mohammed Dahlan,"GAZA (Reuters) -  Mohammad Dahlan  who played a key backroom role in a major new effort for Palestinian unity   has said a two-state peace agreement with Israel was impossible and healing wounds from a civil war that split Palestine was now a priority.
“It was an honor for us ... that we succeeded to have those understandings between Hamas and Egypt ”  Dahlan  said by telephone from Abu Dhabi.  The former Gaza security chief  said  he  had kept silent during mediation efforts but decided to speak out now that they have borne fruit.
 Dahlan  said Egypt  which has accused Hamas of aiding an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula across the border from Gaza  held meetings with senior officials of the group  which denies aiding the militants.

In the interview   Dahlan  called on Hamas “to show more patience because all the good things are on the way” thanks to Egyptian mediation.
 He  dismissed any notion that Egypt  with the UAE and Saudi Arabia  was pursuing Palestinian reconciliation as part of any wider U.S.-initiated push for a regional peace deal with Israel.
“The ball is in his court and we are ready whenever he is ” said  Dahlan   in exile since 2011 after quarrelling with Abbas.
 Dahlan  said  his  strong ties with the UAE helped  him  to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for Palestinians in Gaza  the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the past 10 years.
A recent poll by the West Bank-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey showed that those who still support Fatah in Gaza are shifting loyalty to  Dahlan .  His  popularity among Gazans has risen over the past nine months from nine to 23 percent.
 Dahlan  said  he  was not “obsessed” by opinion polls and a decision on whether  he  would run for a president would await until an election date is set.","GAZA (Reuters) -  Mohammad Dahlan  who played a key backroom role in a major new effort for Palestinian unity   has said a two-state peace agreement with Israel was impossible and healing wounds from a civil war that split Palestine was now a priority.
“It was an honor for us ... that we succeeded to have those understandings between Hamas and Egypt ”  Dahlan  said by telephone from Abu Dhabi.  The former Gaza security chief  said  he  had kept silent during mediation efforts but decided to speak out now that they have borne fruit.
 Dahlan  said Egypt  which has accused Hamas of aiding an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai peninsula across the border from Gaza  held meetings with senior officials of the group  which denies aiding the militants.

In the interview   Dahlan  called on Hamas “to show more patience because all the good things are on the way” thanks to Egyptian mediation.
 He  dismissed any notion that Egypt  with the UAE and Saudi Arabia  was pursuing Palestinian reconciliation as part of any wider U.S.-initiated push for a regional peace deal with Israel.
“The ball is in his court and we are ready whenever he is ” said  Dahlan   in exile since 2011 after quarrelling with Abbas.
 Dahlan  said  his  strong ties with the UAE helped  him  to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for Palestinians in Gaza  the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the past 10 years.

3577,All the Key Details Republicans Left Out of Their Famous Memo,Team Trump,"That flimsiness extends to the rest of the document  the release of which FBI officials and Democrats have been furiously lobbying against for days  in part because it amounts to ammunition  Trump  and  his  allies can use to try to shut down the Russia investigation. Even on first reading  the most striking part of the memo is what it leaves out.
Which is to say the memo fails to account for the fact that Page was no longer on Team Trump when the feds went after him in 2016.
Likewise  the memo does not explicitly acknowledge a previous FISA application that’s been reported against Page as far back as 2014  possibly set up because he was being actively recruited by Russian spies who subsequently were expelled or imprisoned. What the memo suggests is simply that the feds submitted reauthorization applications around January 20  2017  in April 2017  and July of 2017. With each reauthorization  as the memo alludes  the Justice Department would have had to show that it continued to obtain foreign intelligence from the surveillance. That also means the FISA Court approved three reauthorizations after the Steele dossier became public—and the  Trump  team itself started debunking it.
So Page continued to look like a spy—or someone being recruited as one—to FBI counterintelligence agents well into the  Trump  presidency. And FISA judges continued to buy that assessment.
And in spite of the memo’s title and the heated claims Republicans have been making for weeks  much of the memo actually doesn’t pertain to Page’s FISA application at all. It reveals then-Deputy Associate Attorney General Bruce Ohr appropriately noted Steele’s apparent hope to ensure Trump not become President. But even there  the memo doesn’t explain whether that primarily stemmed from concerns about Russia or more personal political animus  which is particularly relevant given that Steele is not an American voter. The memo also reveals that after Steele’s communications with the press became known  his informant status was properly terminated. It further describes Trump’s being briefed on the dossier without explaining why: because the Intelligence Community thought it important for  Trump  to know the rumors being spread about  him .","That flimsiness extends to the rest of the document  the release of which FBI officials and Democrats have been furiously lobbying against for days  in part because it amounts to ammunition  Trump  and  his  allies can use to try to shut down the Russia investigation.

3582,Uma Thurman has a brutal Thanksgiving message for Weinstein and his 'wicked conspirators',Harvey Weinstein,"Last month  a red carpet interview with Uma Thurman went viral after she declined to answer a question about the wave of sexual harassment claims sweeping Hollywood in light of allegations against Harvey Weinstein. She said the women who were speaking up were commendable  but she didn't want to say much more.
Thurman starred in a number of movies that  Weinstein  produced  as both she and  Weinstein  were frequent collaborators with director Quentin Tarantino.  Weinstein 's Miramax was behind ""Pulp Fiction"" and both volumes of ""Kill Bill."" Thurman also starred in the Miramax movies ""Beautiful Girls"" and ""A Month by the Lake.""
Tarantino has also spoken out against  Weinstein  - and taken himself to task - following the many public accusations against the former producer. Tarantino told the New York Times that he knew of the more serious allegations long before the stories broke  because he had dated one of  Weinstein 's accusers  Mira Sorvino.
The director also knew about the settlement that  Weinstein  and another accuser  Rose McGowan  had reached. Still  he was shocked by how many people  Weinstein  allegedly victimized. With so many women coming forward with their stories  he suspects things may finally change in the industry.

3584,Cry your eyes out with these five essential 'This Is Us' episodes,Randall Pearson,"Meet the Big Three: Kate (Chrissy Metz)   Kevin (Justin Hartley)  and Randall Pearson (Sterling K. Brown) .  They 're all turning 36  and so is Jack (Milo Ventimglia) back in 1980 while wife Rebecca (Mandy Moore) goes into labor. Back in the quaint fall of 2016  Hillary Clinton was running for President and we didn't know that this was the story of one family over the years.
It was around this time that we learned This Is Us would emotionally wreck us on the reg  in this case by introducing a young William trying to reconnect with his son after abandoning him at the fire station. Rebecca agrees to allow this  but experiences a change of heart at the last second. She leaves William without any way of reaching the family  but she changes baby Kyle's name to  Randall  — for William's favorite poet  Dudley Randall.
Horrified that Rebecca kept him from his biological father   Randall  flees to the family's cabin with  his  siblings  along with Kevin's costar Olivia and two of her friends. Kate is furious by the unwanted visitors;  Randall  accidentally takes their drugs and hallucinates Jack at the cabin  giving us a rare scene between Brown and Ventimiglia — one of the only scenes between Ventimiglia and the actors who play  his  adult children  period.
As her due date approaches  Rebecca panics and completely forget's Jack's birthday. We catch up with Dr. K on the same day (note: a Dr. K episode always means extra tissues) and learn that he's still struggling with his wife's death. That's not even the saddest part of the episode; the fireman who finds  Randall  at the station couldn't have children with  his  wife  so  he  finds  Randall  and thinks it's a miracle. Dr. K delivers the triplets again  and loses one  again. We are sobbing  again.

“Today  I am calling on my colleague  Al Franken  to step aside. I’ve struggled with this decision because  he ’s been a good Senator and I consider  him  a friend ” she wrote. “But that cannot excuse  his  behavior and  his  mistreatment of women.”

3590,Rubio : House Senate Bills Differ But He Expects No Clash,Rubio,"There will be differences between tax reform bills proposed by Republicans in the House and Senate  but at the end of the day   Sen. Marco Rubio  said  he  does not see a clash occurring between the two chambers over the bill.
 Rubio  said one of the things  he  knows will be different in the two bills is the matter of the state and local taxes exemption.
""I live  you know  in Florida and I do my taxes ""  Rubio  said. ""I get to write off my property tax  a portion of the sales tax  if you're itemizing.""
Many people are angry over possibly losing that exemption  but  Rubio  said what really matters is how much people will be paying overall  not how they get to that figure.
""While that may be going away  there are other things that are going up ""  Rubio  said. ""The overwhelming majority of Americans who need a tax cut are going to get one  so in the end  it doesn't really matter . . . what matters most of all is how much are you paying  because i think that's what people care about at the end of the day  how much they are paying.""
The bill being unveiled Thursday  meanwhile  is just a starting point   Rubio  said  and  he  anticipates there will be things in it  he 'd like to change.
""If the child tax credit is not high enough or if it's not refundable  I'll want to change that  because I think we have to do that for working families — people out there that are raising two  three  four children ""  Rubio  said. ""Both parents work really hard. We can't raise their taxes. They need a tax cut. It's expensive to raise kids.""
 Rubio   in an op-ed piece for The New York Times over the weekend  called for doubling the per-child tax credit to $2 000 and making it refundable against payroll tax liability.  He  also said that the House tax bill falls short in that regard  and does not know if the Senate will add more.
""I don't know if they'll get to that number "" Rubio said  'But I think it will be better. I expect it'll be better than the House position. And we'll keep working on it. Look  if I don't like it  I can file an amendment on the Senate floor.

3591,UK minister Damian Green fired over porn scandal,Damian Green,"An investigation by the UK Cabinet Office found that  Damian Green 's previous denials over the issue were ""inaccurate and misleading.""
More recently   Green  was accused by by journalist and former Conservative party activist Kate Maltby of making unwanted advances towards her during a meeting in 2015.
The loss of  Green  is a personal blow for May. He was her closest ally in Cabinet  and brokered the deal with the Democratic Unionist Party that kept her in power after her Conservative party lost its parliamentary majority in a botched election in June.
 Green  is the third cabinet member to leave in the past two months  following the resignations of Defense Secretary Michael Fallon over allegations of inappropriate behavior with women  and of International Development Secretary Priti Patel over unauthorized meetings with senior Israeli politicians.
The Cabinet Office report found that by lying about the pornography   Green  had breached the code of conduct for UK ministers. It also said that Maltby's account was plausible  although it was ""not possible to reach a definitive conclusion on the appropriateness of  Mr Green 's behavior"" with her.

3592,New Poll: In Swing Districts Virginia Voters Strongly Support Governor,Ralph Northam,"New Poll: In Swing Districts  Voters Strongly Support Governor-Elect Ralph Northam and the Democratic Agenda
Richmond  Va. — According to a new poll by Public Policy Polling  Governor-Elect Ralph Northam remains popular with voters in Republican-held legislative swing districts — and voters there strongly back bipartisan policy solutions on a range of issues  from health care to gun violence prevention to economic development.
“ Ralph Northam  ran on a common-sense agenda to move Virginia forward last November — and  he  won in a landslide victory ” said DPVA Chairwoman Susan Swecker. “Now  voters want leaders in both parties to come together and work with  Governor-Elect Northam  to pass common sense solutions that help Virginia families. As the new year begins  lawmakers in the General Assembly have a unique opportunity to put aside their partisan differences and deliver for the people of Virginia.”
“In these polarized times it’s unusual to see majority support for a Governor and his party’s policy proposals in districts represented by the opposite party ” said Director of Public Policy Polling Tom Jensen. “A majority of voters in these districts represented by Republican legislators view  Ralph Northam  favorably — and they show strong support for Democratic policy solutions.”
In November   Northam  won twelve legislative districts currently held by Republican delegates and state senators  along with HD 94 and 28  which are still being contested. The survey found that  Northam   and the Democratic agenda  remain popular with voters in these Republican-leaning districts. 50 percent of voters in these Republican-held districts — which are cumulatively more Republican than Virginia as a whole — view  Northam  favorably  while only 35 percent with an unfavorable opinion of him.","New Poll: In Swing Districts  Voters Strongly Support Governor-Elect Ralph Northam and the Democratic Agenda

3595,James Toback's On,James Toback,"In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein revelations  one of the first things I thought was: ""Who's next?""  My wife Anna Scott  a public radio reporter for KCRW in Los Angeles  had an answer: James Toback .
 She  is one of what appears to be a very long list of women who have been accosted by the New York-based writer and director behind films like Black and White  Two Girls and a Guy and The Pick Up Artist. My wife's own gruesome story dates back to about 18 years ago  when she was a senior in high school. Toback vaguely offered her a film role and then proceeded to talk to her about masturbation and pubic hair. Fortunately  she managed to extricate herself as the conversation moved to the prospect of heading to a hotel room somewhere  but she was still left feeling humiliated.
As a reporter for LA Weekly who's covered sexual misconduct cases before  I began reaching out to a number of women who had tweeted about their own  Toback  experiences. I spoke with a total of nine of them  all of whom revealed similar stories of unwanted sexual advances from  Toback   a mere fraction of the 38 who initially talked to reporter Glenn Whipp of the Los Angeles Times. Since the story first published  hundreds of others  including Selma Blair  Rachel McAdams and Julianne Moore  have reportedly come forward. Most of the stories I heard followed a similar plot.
Ambika Leigh says she met Toback in 2008  when she was a 30-year-old aspiring actress and waitress at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel  and that he told her he was a director looking for an actress to collaborate with on his next film. According to Leigh  they would meet a number of times over the next two months  for lunch or dinner  and just talk. After dinner one night  she says   Toback  invited her to a house where he was staying. She says  Toback  told her  he  wanted to do some ""acting exercises"" with her  in order to build trust and establish a bond that  he  said was important to  his  filmmaking process. She was reluctant at first  but finally agreed.
"" He  sat me on a chair and kneeled down in front of me "" she recalls. ""Before I knew what was happening   he  was humping my shin. Humping me like a dog. It was so shocking."" She says she found the act more pathetic than threatening. ""I started laughing at  him  "" she says. ""And then  quickly   he  came in  his  pants. I could feel the warmth on my leg.  He  totally ejaculated.""
She says  Toback  began analyzing her body  commenting on how  he  would photograph her  what parts of her  he  would allow the camera to rest upon. Next  she says   he  asked her to sit on a chair and began telling her about other actresses  he 'd slept with  how it was part of  his  process. After what seemed like hours of just talking  she says  he  walked over – still fully dressed – crouched down  and started rubbing  his  crotch against her leg. ""I looked at  him  "" says Kamin  who then asked  him   ""'Are you trying to get off?' And  he  looked at me and said  'Absolutely.' I just said  'No  I'm out.' I grabbed my clothes and left.""
I reached out to  Toback  through  his  agent  Jeff Berg  who has since parted ways with the director.  Toback  called me back on Tuesday  October 17th  four days before the Times story was published.  He  asked me if I was recording the call. I wasn't.  He  told me  he  was  and that  he  wouldn't talk to  me  if I didn't – I wouldn't believe how many times  he 'd been misquoted   he  said. I told  him  I'd figure something out  and  he  said  he 'd call back in a few hours. And so  he  did.
 James Toback : Lemme be really clear about this. I don't want to get a pat on the back  but I've struggled seriously to make movies with very little money  that I write  that I direct  that mean my life to  me . The idea that I would offer a part to anyone for any other reason than that he or she was gonna be the best of anyone I could find is so disgusting to  me . And anyone who says it is a lying cocksucker or cunt or both. Can I be any clearer than that?
Toback: Anyone who says that  I just want to spit in his or her fucking face. I'm sitting here with Sienna Miller. By the way  no one who's ever worked with  me  would ever say anything like that. No one. But I've just finished a movie with Sienna  which you should see  and help to get out there  called The Private Life of a Modern Woman. But here  she's sitting right here  so just say hello to her.
[Off-the-record conversations take place  before the phone is passed back to  Toback .]
 Toback : No  seriously  I find it offensive and insulting and disgusting  that people… Because it's the opposite of the way I work. I don't give my best friends parts unless they deserve them. Ever.
 Toback : Give me one name.
 Toback : OK  that is a total lie. I never heard of the person before. And then who was the other one? First of all  that description wouldn't fit anyone  but I never heard that name before in my life. And believe me  I would remember it  because it's a very unusual name.
 Toback : Anything like that is nauseating and disgusting. And I would never say anything like 'I'll get you a film role.' It's too stupid to dignify. It's pathetic lies. It's just too fucking embarrassing and idiotic. And if I were you  I wouldn't go repeating it  unless you really knew it were true  because it isn't. So that's all I have to say. This is not worth wasting another second on.
 Toback : OK.
Shortly after I hung up   Toback  called back. This time  I didn't record the call. He told me he thought my questions were ""really rude "" and that I should talk to someone he's actually worked with. ""You can speak to a multitude of people I've worked with "" he said  ""you will never hear anything but a good word.

3597,You Might Not Be A Harvey Weinstein But You Could Be An Aziz Ansari,Harvey Weinstein,"It is very easy to look at  Harvey Weinstein  and make a moral judgement.  The man  was an immensely powerful studio executive with the power to make or break careers.  He  forced  himself  on dozens  if not literally hundreds of women.  He  is  quite frankly  unattractive. In short   he  fits the image of a serial rapist. We can look at  his  behavior and match it to what we collectively understand about rape. There is no semblance of consent anywhere in there. Men can examine their own behavior and say “I have never whipped it out and masturbated into a potted plant ” and do so with confidence. They are not Harvey Weinstein.
But  Aziz Ansari  is more complicated  because it is less cut and dry. There are not hundreds of women coming forward. There is no weird sexual behavior  only relatively common practices.  The woman  doesn’t even have a firm identity that we can use to make comparative judgments about our proximity to  her . (This is not to say I don’t believe the account  just that anonymity often raises public suspicion a la Rolling Stone’s “A Rape on Campus”.) Men read Grace’s story and begin to panic. They’ve done things like that before - had sex without communicating  had a hook-up end with someone in tears. Does this mean they too will lose their careers  their standing in the public? If it can happen to Aziz Ansari  a self-proclaimed feminist comedian  could it really happen to anyone?
Harvey Weinstein is an anomaly  or at least a relative rarity. Aziz Ansari is not. When Weiss adds the throwaway line  “I’m apparently the victim of sexual assault” at the beginning of the piece  it has a kind of weight to it that few readers likely pick up on. It signifies that  yes  the epidemic of sexual violence really is as widespread and pervasive as we’ve been saying  because sexual violence doesn’t just entail brutal  violent acts of rape. It means that  no  it’s not just as easy as women being able to boldly proclaim their sexual agency in the same way that men do without being labeled a slut or a whore. It says that  yes  men are complicit in this system in a variety of ways and at different places within the hierarchy of abuse.
The sad fact is that Grace  whoever she may be  did not choose to have what to most men seems an unpleasant sexual encounter become so deeply upsetting. Perhaps another woman would have been disturbed but ultimately unaffected in the long term. But this is not how trauma operates.  We  do not get to choose when and how it affects  us   or under what circumstances it can seep into  us . When  we  freeze up  choke on  our  words  are unable to fully sit in  our  bodies it is not because  we  consciously choose to do so  it is because  we  revert to some primal instinct of self-protection.","It is very easy to look at [TGT]and make a moral judgement.

3598,Be a Fearless Provider,Elizabeth,"Nine years ago   Elizabeth  was struggling to get by as a divorced mother of three.
 Elizabeth  remembers  “Fear was not being able to provide for them and not being able to meet their needs.”
The income  she  received from child support and  her  full-time job wasn’t enough to pay for the basics. So  Elizabeth  began using credit cards to buy groceries  clothes and to pay  her  bills. Before long   she  was $9 000 in debt.
 Elizabeth  recalls  “I was constantly worried about how I was going to pay bills  how I was going to pay rent sometimes. How I was going to pay the electric bill.”
To make matter’s worse   Elizabeth ’s employer relocated  her . In doing so   her  living expenses doubled.
 Elizabeth  shares  “A lot of my prayers were just  ‘Just help me make it through to the next whenever.’”
Over the next four years   Elizabeth  lived paycheck to paycheck. Then  at the suggestion of a friend   she  started attending a new church. It was there  she  learned the importance of tithing.
 Elizabeth  says  “That was the first time I ever heard somebody say to  me  that like God owns 100% and He allows you to keep 90%. I knew  for a fact I was not living and doing what God's best was.”
That’s when  she  said  she  heard God speak to  her .
 Elizabeth  recalls  “It wasn't audible  but I just remember hearing God say  ‘You have to trust me. You just have to trust me.’”
The following Sunday   Elizabeth  began tithing at church.
 Elizabeth  shares  “I would like to say that suddenly I had this huge windfall and I made like a gazillion extra dollars. That did not happen. I had just enough. I had what I needed.”
During this time   she  also learned about the importance of having a budget and how to get out of debt.
 Elizabeth  says  “You pay God  you pay yourself  and then you pay all the other expenses. And so I 've actually started saving. Oh and the other really great thing about saving for Christmas and birthdays  is I don't put it on a credit card  right? And so I pay cash for everything  that's so great  I love it.”
 Elizabeth  started a new retail job with a 10% salary increase. And then over the next few months   she  received several bonus checks.
 Elizabeth  recalls  “I knew for sure that I was going to continue to tithe  no matter what. I just have seen God do some really amazing things  and just grow my faith in ways that probably would not have happened if I had not been faithful with what he had given me.”","Nine years ago   [TGT]was struggling to get by as a divorced mother of three.

During this time   [TGT]  also learned about the importance of having a budget and how to get out of debt.
 [TGT]says  “You pay God  you pay yourself  and then you pay all the other expenses. And so I 've actually started saving. Oh and the other really great thing about saving for Christmas and birthdays  is I don't put it on a credit card  right? And so I pay cash for everything  that's so great  I love it.”
 [TGT]started a new retail job with a 10% salary increase. And then over the next few months   [TGT]  received several bonus checks.
 [TGT]recalls  “I knew for sure that I was going to continue to tithe  no matter what. I just have seen God do some really amazing things  and just grow my faith in ways that probably would not have happened if I had not been faithful with what he had given me.”",Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive
3599,Ann Curry 's History With Matt Lauer and the Today Show,Ann Curry,"Ann Curry  will soon make  her  return to television with  her  new PBS program We’ll Meet Again  but in interviews promoting the show   she  is being asked to look backwards — to  her  exit from the Today show nearly six years ago.
 Curry  spent 15 years with NBC’s morning show  and from 2011 to 2012  she  served as co-anchor alongside Matt Lauer.
 Her  tearful on-air announcement that  she  was leaving is remembered as a landmark moment in morning show television. NBC has long said the decision was based on ratings  and the network declined to comment on Wednesday. But fans and journalists like then-New York Times media critic Brian Stelter  who detailed the tension between Lauer and  Curry  in  his  2013 book “Top of the Morning ” believe Lauer had something to do with her departure.
In an interview on CBS This Morning on Wednesday  co-anchor Gayle King said to  Curry   “It was viewed that a very powerful man  meaning Matt Lauer  derailed your career.”  Curry —  after joking  “Don’t worry  I’m not going to start crying” — responded  “You should ask someone else  I’m not the one to ask about that … I don’t know what was all behind it. I do know that it hurt like hell.”
Asked if she thought Lauer – who was fired in November over claims of sexual misconduct – abused his power   Curry  said  “I’m trying to do no harm in these conversations. I can tell you that I am not surprised by the allegations.”
When King asked  Curry  whether  she  “heard things” or “knew things” while  she  was at NBC   Curry  responded: “I’m trying not to hurt people and I know what it’s like to be publicly humiliated. I never did anything wrong to be publicly humiliated  and I don’t want to cause that kind of pain to somebody else.
After Lauer’s firing  some of  Curry’s  fans took to social media to speculate how she felt about the news. The meme “Somewhere Ann Curry” imagined the former co-anchor greeting the news in various ways  for instance  “Somewhere Ann Curry is breaking out that champagne.”","[TGT]will soon make  [TGT]  return to television with  [TGT]  new PBS program We’ll Meet Again  but in interviews promoting the show   [TGT]  is being asked to look backwards — to  [TGT]  exit from the Today show nearly six years ago.

 She  was responding to a report that Iran and Iraq plan to seize control of the border crossings around a semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq that is populated by a Kurdish ethnic minority that plays a crucial role in the U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State.

 Nauert  took a cautious approach to the diplomatic crisis.

3602,Flu Season Far From Over: What to Do if You Catch the Virus,Melissa Velez,"Registered nurse Melissa Velez tells Newsmax Health that a trip to the emergency room is warranted if you  a loved one  or your child feel like you are unable to breathe normally  can’t eat  or have a fever that does not go down with medication.
“The most important thing is to stay home  rest and stay hydrated. Drink plenty of clear fluids to prevent dehydration and avoid close contact with others ” says  Velez .  She  advises staying home from work or school and not returning until you have been fever free for at least 24 hours.
Holistic health coach Deanna Durso echoes  Velez ’s sentiments on the importance of hydration  telling Newsmax Health it’s one of the most important aspects of fighting off the flu.
Experts also suggest lots of rest to fight the flu  but advise not lying flat on your back  which can make it harder to clear your lungs and the position can lead to increased coughing fits.  Velez  suggests lying propped up with a few pillows instead.
 She  adds that grandma’s wisdom about chicken noodle soup being a panacea may be true  but alcohol should be avoided. It can contribute to dehydration and  although it can make you sleepy  it doesn’t lead to quality REM sleep.  She  says alcohol will likely make you feel worse.
 Velez  says the best medication for the flu  other than Tamiflu (which should be taken within the first 48 hours that symptoms emerge)  is an over-the-counter fever reducer like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Although suitable for adults  these medications are not advised for use in children under age 2.","[TGT] tells Newsmax Health that a trip to the emergency room is warranted if you  a loved one  or your child feel like you are unable to breathe normally  can’t eat  or have a fever that does not go down with medication.

3604,Virginia stakes claim to ACC supremacy hammers North Carolina,De'Andre Hunter,"Virginia’s De’Andre  Hunter  did his part in the second half in front of an announced crowd of 14 401  including collecting a loose ball near the baseline  spinning and elevating for a one-handed dunk over Joel Berry II  last season’s Final Four most outstanding player.
Once  Hunter  landed  the redshirt freshman flexed and then bellowed in celebration as the Cavaliers (14-1  3-0 ACC) took a 45-36 lead with 12:41 remaining. No. 12 North Carolina got within five points moments later  but Virginia bumped the margin to 10 when Kyle Guy came off a screen for a three-pointer  and  Hunter  and Nigel Johnson both made free throws.
 Hunter  finished with 10 points in  his  second straight game playing as a stretch-four in Coach Tony Bennett’s four-guard lineup.  He  was among six Virginia players who dunked and had the Cavaliers looking far more athletic than North Carolina (12-4  1-2)  which lost a second straight game for the first time since February 2016.
“I tracked down the rebound  and I saw the baseline open  and I saw Joel Berry  and I really wanted him to jump ”  Hunter  said of  his  highlight reel jam. “Once I got the ball  I knew I was going to dunk it  so I was hoping he jumped.
The moxie to do so against an accomplished player underscores  Hunter ’s considerable confidence that  according to both  he  and Bennett  comes in part from sitting out last season.
That wasn’t the plan when  Hunter  arrived in Charlottesville  but a high ankle sprain compelled Bennett to eventually decide redshirting would allow the 6-foot-7 wing player to focus on getting stronger.  Hunter  spent countless hours in the weight room  and this season the results have been translating onto the court.
“It was a hard decision because we thought  he  possibly could have helped us in certain ways ” Bennett said  “but we thought for  his  physical maturity and development of  his  game   his  ball skills   his  shooting  just going to work like all of our redshirts  we thought it might be the best  maybe not short term for us  but long term for  him  and for us  we thought it was the right decision.”
 Hunter  has scored in double figures in three of  his  past four games  including 14 in Wednesday night’s 78-52 rout of Virginia Tech  which was the largest margin of victory for the Cavaliers in the series since 1955.
 He  added seven rebounds against North Carolina  which committed 19 turnovers that led to 25 points. The Tar Heels scored just three points off turnovers  a disparity  Williams  lamented along with blaming  himself  for not having  his  team ready for the Cavaliers’ vaunted defense.
“Their defense was a million times stronger than our offense ”  Williams  said. “We didn’t have very good movement. We sort of tried to go one-on-one way too many times  didn’t get as much as we needed to taking the ball to the basket. Their defense was really good. I told Tony it’s about as good a defensive game as I’ve had anybody play against us  maybe ever but definitely in a long time.”","Virginia’s De’Andre  Hunter  did his part in the second half in front of an announced crowd of 14 401  including collecting a loose ball near the baseline  spinning and elevating for a one-handed dunk over Joel Berry II  last season’s Final Four most outstanding player.

3607,Ald. Burke under ethics board investigation for possible conflict of interest,Burke,"City ethics officials  are looking into whether longtime Ald.  Ed Burke   14th  violated ethics rules when  he  sidelined an effort to increase the property taxes paid by the owners of two buildings  his  law firm represents  according to the alderman whose effort  he  blocked.
Ethics board Executive Director Steve Berlin and Chairman William Conlon neither confirmed nor denied the review  in keeping with city regulations. Neither  Burke  nor  his  spokesman responded to questions Friday.
The  Burke  probe comes after 32nd Ward Ald. Scott Waguespack filed a formal request for the ethics board to look into the matter on Thursday  a day after the Tribune published a story raising the question of whether  Burke  had violated city ethics rules at the Jan. 17 City Council meeting.
On Munoz’s list are two properties owned by companies for which Burke’s law firm has saved millions of dollars in property taxes by appealing to lower assessments used to determine tax bills. The lower the assessment  the less paid in taxes.
If Munoz’s proposal passed and the city succeeded in increasing assessments  the owners of the seven buildings  including the two represented by Klafter &  Burke   would pay more in property taxes.
Shortly after Munoz introduced his proposal   Burke  put up a potential roadblock.
Munoz had asked that the measure be assigned to the Housing and Real Estate Committee  led by 49th Ward Ald. Joe Moore  who had planned to give it a hearing.  Burke  intervened  saying the measure instead should be sent to the Finance Committee.
That’s where  Burke  holds great sway as chairman  in part by deciding whether a proposal ever gets a hearing. When there’s a dispute on which committee should consider a measure  the matter automatically goes to the Rules and Ethics Committee  where legislation often withers on the vine.
Munoz and outside ethics experts questioned whether Burke violated city ethics code by “calling Finance.” The code states that “no official or employee shall make or participate in the making of any governmental decision with respect to any matter in which he has any financial interest ” earned money from during the past year or expects to earn money from in the coming year.
“It’s a violation ” said Waguespack of  Burke ’s action  adding that  he  also wants a broader interpretation from the ethics board on what actions violate conflict-of-interest rules. The earlier Tribune story also noted that  Burke  often presides over Finance Committee meetings considering actions that could affect  his  law firm’s clients  but then abstains from voting.
If the ethics board were to find  Burke  violated the city ethics rules   he  could face a fine of between $500 and $1 000  according to the code.

 Jones  had said earlier Monday that Trump had personally “reminded”  him  about the NFL’s game operations manual  which includes a reference to how players should behave during the national anthem. Citing the manual on Sunday   Jones  had said that any player caught “disrespecting the flag … will not play.”
A big salute to Jerry Jones  owner of the Dallas Cowboys  who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag.""Stand for Anthem or sit for game!"" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10  2017
Referencing the policy again on Monday   Jones  told ESPN’s Chris Mortensen that there “will be no exceptions” to the policy for his team.
 Jones : ""My job is the Dallas Cowboys. It's in the best interests of the Dallas Cowboys  the NFL and the players ...to honor the flag."" — Chris Mortensen (@mortreport) October 9  2017
“There is no room here if it comes between looking non-supportive of our players and of each other or creating the impression that you’re disrespecting the flag  we will be non-supportive of each other ”  Jones  said on Sunday. “We will not disrespect the flag.”
Last month  when Trump first stirred controversy by suggesting that athletes who knelt during the anthem should be “fired ”  Jones  had knelt with the Cowboys before “The Star-Spangled Banner” at a game against the Arizona Cardinals. The team then stood and locked arms during the anthem.
 Jones  told Mortensen that  he  thought the controversy over the anthem would “go away” after the Cardinals game.

The Journal said  the proposal by Sandell  which holds a 2.75 percent stake in Barnes & Noble   also called for roughly $250 million coming from company shareholders keeping their stakes and rolling them into a new private entity  it  would control. (on.wsj.com/2ANekD0)

 Sandell  did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.
The Journal said Riggio’s refusal to roll his stake into a private entity as per Sandell’s plan meant the hedge fund would need to find backing from other major shareholders or put up the cash itself.

3617,Outcome Health's path: From a Northwestern classroom to the courtroom,Derek Moeller,"More than decade ago  Shah and a friend  Derek Moeller  hatched a plan for a health information and advertising startup called ContextMedia while students at Northwestern University   Moeller  said.  Moeller  presented the business plan during Professor William White’s engineering and entrepreneurship class.
Both students had an interest in health because of family members with diabetes  and they started planning. “We both had the entrepreneurial bug and we wanted to make something of it ”  Moeller  said.
 Moeller ’s group got an A on the business plan  said White  who later became one of ContextMedia’s directors.
It was spring 2006 and  Moeller  was set to graduate and work in the banking industry. ContextMedia changed his plans. “We were spending so much time on the business and trying to figure out how to launch it and what the model is going to be that we were really primarily focused on that ” he said.
Neither  Moeller  nor Shah received degrees from Northwestern. Agarwal graduated in 2008 with a bachelor’s of science in journalism  according to Northwestern. Outcome Health spokesman John Eddy said Agarwal was involved in the early discussions and helped with the company in the early days  joining it full-time after graduation.
Shah   Moeller  and Agarwal’s skill sets were complementary  said White  who stepped down from the board in 2013.  Moeller  was more involved in finances and operations  Agarwal focused on marketing strategy and Shah pulled it all together and did the direct selling  White said.
It took at least a year for ContextMedia to land a major advertiser   Moeller  said. In those early days  the company was shipping DVDs to doctors’ offices that had their screens installed  and it was focused on endocrinologists  who treat diabetes  among other conditions. “They really enjoyed the idea of having relevant content in their waiting rooms ”  Moeller  said. “At the time  the primary competitor was soap operas. ‘Judge Judy’ was a big one.”
The recession hit around the same time ContextMedia moved into its first real office space in the Loop. That made fundraising harder. The company was not yet profitable and was still working to solidify itself among advertising clients. There were times when one customer accounted for a majority of the company’s revenue   Moeller  said. “That’s the kind of stuff that keeps you up at night ”  he  said.
Near the end of 2009   Moeller  left to buy a Washington-based manufacturing company called McConkey. ContextMedia bought his shares and it was an amicable parting   Moeller  said. He was proud of where ContextMedia was  and McConkey “needed a turnaround ” he said. He added that at that point  Shah wanted to be the primary driver of ContextMedia. “He wanted this to be more his thing ”  Moeller  said.
Soon after  Moeller ’s departure  the company expanded  starting with the launch of its Rheumatoid Health Network. Between 2010 and 2016  ContextMedia increased its network from a few hundred hospitals and clinics to more than 10 000  according to a 2016 court filing. Its clients were big companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb  and divisions of ad agencies Omnicom Group and Interpublic Group.","More than decade ago  Shah and a friend  [TGT]  hatched a plan for a health information and advertising startup called ContextMedia while students at Northwestern University   Moeller  said.

3619,Coming of age in the age of sexual harassment,Harvey Weinstein,"I could have  though  which is one reason it struck me so hard when I read it Thursday. Those are the opening words of the quasi-apology issued by  movie impresario Harvey Weinstein  after The New York Times reported that  he  had sexually preyed on women for the past 30 years.
According to the Times  Weinstein  one of Hollywood’s most powerful men  invited the actress Ashley Judd to a meeting in  his  hotel room then asked if she’d watch  him  shower.  He  promised another young woman that  he ’d help her career in exchange for sex.  He  asked a female assistant to give  him  a massage while  he  was naked. There were others.
 Weinstein  has denounced the Times report and is threatening to sue  but  he  also issued a mea culpa for unspecified wrongs  he  has done and pain  he  has caused  with the suggestion that  his  problem is rooted in the world that shaped  him .
“That was the culture then ”  he  said in  his  statement.
 Weinstein  was born in 1952  the year before the recently departed Hugh Hefner invented Playboy magazine.  He  grew up in an era when men yukked it up over Playboy playmates  which corresponded to the moment that women  newly liberated by the birth control pill  were finding their way in record numbers into college  grad school and jobs once reserved for men.
How much mercy does  Weinstein  deserve because  he  came into power when men were less likely to be outed for using it in abusive  sexual ways?
 His  adviser in this scandal  the attorney Lisa Bloom  who ordinarily defends women in sexual harassment cases  has called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.”
 We ’re all products of  our  time.  Weinstein  came into adulthood in an age that made it easier for men to kids themselves that harassment was OK. But deep down  I’m guessing   he  always knew it was wrong. Power often seduces people  regardless of gender  into doing whatever they can get away with.
Sexual harassment in the workplace still thrives  from the movie studio to the TV network (think  Fox  and no doubt others) to hot new startups (think Uber) to  well  probably everywhere.

 [TGT]was born in 1952  the year before the recently departed Hugh Hefner invented Playboy magazine.  [TGT]  grew up in an era when men yukked [TGT] up over Playboy playmates  which corresponded to the moment that women  newly liberated by the birth control pill  were finding their way in record numbers into college  grad school and jobs once reserved for men.
How much mercy does  [TGT]deserve because  [TGT]  came into power when men were less likely to be outed for using it in abusive  sexual ways?
 [TGT]  adviser in this scandal  the attorney Lisa Bloom  who ordinarily defends women in sexual harassment cases  has called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.”
 [TGT] ’re all products of  [TGT]  time.  [TGT]came into adulthood in an age that made it easier for men to kids themselves that harassment was OK. But deep down  I’m guessing   [TGT]  always knew it was wrong. Power often seduces people  regardless of gender  into doing whatever they can get away with.
Sexual harassment in the workplace still thrives  from the movie studio to the TV network (think  Fox  and no doubt others) to hot new startups (think Uber) to  well  probably everywhere.

3620,Longtime sportscaster Dick Enberg found dead at home at 82,Dick Enberg,"Dick Enberg  a Hall of Fame broadcaster known as much for  his  excited calls of ""Oh my!"" as the big events  he  covered during a 60-year career  has died.  He  was 82.
 Enberg 's daughter  Nicole Enberg Vaz  confirmed the death to The Associated Press. She said the family became concerned when her father didn't arrive Thursday on his flight to Boston  and he was found dead at his home in La Jolla  a San Diego neighborhood  with his bags packed.
His daughter said the family believes  Enberg  died of a heart attack but was awaiting official word.
 Enberg 's wife  Barbara  already was in Boston and was expecting his arrival.
The family ""is grateful for the kind thoughts and prayers of all of Dick's countless fans and dear friends "" according to a statement released by  Enberg 's attorney  Dennis Coleman. ""At this time we are all still processing the significant loss  and we ask for prayers and respectful privacy in the immediate aftermath of such untimely news.""
 Enberg  got  his  big break with UCLA basketball and went on to call Super Bowls  Olympics  Final Fours and Angels and Padres baseball games as well as Rams football games.
 He  retired from  his  TV job with the Padres in October 2016  capping a six-decade career punctuated with countless calls of ""Oh my!"" in describing big plays.  He  also was well known for  his  baseball catchphrase of ""Touch 'em all!"" for home runs.
"" Dick  was an institution in the industry for 60 years and we were lucky enough to have  his  iconic voice behind the microphone for Padres games for nearly a decade "" Padres owners Ron Fowler and Peter Seidler said in a statement.
 Enberg 's many former broadcast partners included Merlin Olsen  Al McGuire  Billy Packer  Don Drysdale and Tony Gwynn. He even worked a few games with Wooden  whom he called ""The greatest man I've ever known other than my own father.""
 Enberg  called Padres games for seven seasons and went into the broadcasters' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015 as the recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award.
""There will never be another Dick Enberg "" CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus said. ""As the voice of generations of fans   Dick  was a masterful storyteller  a consummate professional and a true gentleman.  He  was one of the true legends of our business.""
John Ireland  the radio voice of the Los Angeles Lakers  tweeted : ""If  there was a Mount Rushmore of LA Sports Announcers  Dick Enberg  is on  it  with Chick Hearn  Vin Scully and Bob Miller. Rams  Angels  UCLA  NBC  and so much more. Was the first famous announcer I ever met  and he couldn't have been nicer. Definition of a gentleman.""
 Enberg  won 13 Sports Emmy Awards and a Lifetime Achievement Emmy. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame  and UCLA named its Media Center in Pauley Pavilion after  Enberg  this year.
At halftime of a UCLA game in February  former Bruins stars Bill Walton and Jamaal Wilkes presented  Enberg  with a No. 8 jersey  signifying the number of championships he called.
""That's not going to happen again ""  Enberg  said before the game. ""Who was looking over  me ? To be able to come in and ride the Wooden Wave.""
""Kindest  most proactive possible treatment of newcomers in this business  for the length of his career "" broadcaster Keith Olbermann said of  Enberg  on Twitter .

3621,New twists in probe of Natalie Wood's mysterious 1981 death,Robert Wagner,"Renewed interest came this week when the lead detective in the case said her widower  actor Robert Wagner  now 87  is considered a person of interest.
Wagner wrote in a 2008 memoir that he and Walken argued that night. Walken went to bed and  Wagner  stayed up for a while  he wrote. When he went to bed  he noticed his wife and a rubber dinghy that had been tied to the yacht were missing.
""There are only two possibilities ""  Wagner  wrote  ""either she was trying to get away from the argument  or she was trying to tie the dinghy. But the bottom line is that nobody knows exactly what happened.""
FILE - This Nov. 30  1981 file photo shows the ""Prince Valiant "" the inflatable dinghy used by Natalie Wood  moored at the harbor in Avalon  Calif.  after it washed up on the rocks on Santa Catalina Island. Patrolmen discovered the actress' body 200 yards off Blue Cavern Point on Catalina Island  100 yards away from the boat after a seven hour search. Investigators are now calling her husband  Robert Wagner  a ""person of interest"" in the 1981 death of Wood. Mystery has swirled around Wood's death. It was declared an accident but police reopened the case in 2011 to see whether Wagner or anyone else played a role (AP Photo/Paul J. Harrington  File)
When the case was reopened  Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. John Corina said  Wagner  was not a suspect.
This week  Corina told CBS News that  he  didn't believe  Wagner  had told the whole story about what happened and called  him  a person of interest in the case.
Initially  a sheriff's spokeswoman downplayed the report Thursday and said there was nothing new in the case. But later  the department issued a statement confirming that  Wagner  is a person of interest.
WHAT WALKEN AND  WAGNER  TOLD INVESTIGATORS
Investigators made at least 10 attempts to interview  Wagner  again after reopening the investigation in 2011  including tracking  him  down in Colorado. But either  Wagner  or  his  lawyer refused.

For nearly four decades  mystery and speculation have swirled around the death of the actress who was nominated for three Academy Awards and starred in ""West Side Story"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause."" (Photo by Todd Williamson /Invision/AP)
 Wagner 's attorney  Blair Berk  issued a statement five years ago saying neither  Wagner  nor  his  daughters had any new information and blaming people for trying to exploit the 30th anniversary of Wood's death.
"" Mr. Wagner  has fully cooperated over the last 30 years in the investigation of the accidental drowning of  his  wife in 1981 "" Berk said at the time. "" Mr. Wagner  has been interviewed on multiple occasions by the Los Angeles sheriff's department and answered every single question asked of  him  by detectives during those interviews.""
Detectives also interviewed other actors who knew  Wagner  and Wood to learn more about their relationship.
One witness described hearing yelling and crashing sounds coming from the couple's stateroom  she said. Shortly afterward  other witnesses heard a man and woman arguing on the back of the boat and believe the voices were those of Wood and  Wagner .

3627,Cramer's charts predict full speed ahead for industrial stocks,Bob Lang,"So Cramer called on technician Bob Lang  the founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and one of the three minds behind TheStreet.com's Trifecta Stocks newsletter  to see if the industrials' already lengthy rally can continue into the new year.
 Lang  liked the stock's high trading volume  an indicator technicians use to verify dramatic moves. High volume means that there are a lot of buyers pushing the stock higher  so  Lang  thought the move was telling the truth.
""Put it all together and this chart's got a lot going for it "" Cramer said. "" Lang  says Caterpillar is  his  favorite name in the group  and this combination of positives makes  him  think the stock could take a run at $155 or even $160 early in the new year.""
"" Lang  says the V-shaped bottom pattern tends to be quite bullish —  he  could see this stock ... take a run at $75 in the not-too-distant future "" Cramer said. ""At the moment  the stock's trading at $66.  Lang  says  he 'd love to buy it on a pullback to $63  where Emerson has the support of the 50-day moving average ... but who knows if you'll get that kind of decline?""
 Lang  said shares of Honeywell may have gotten overheated  but noted a few positives: the pullback happened on lower volume  meaning there aren't any major sellers  and the stock has been holding above its floor of support.
""Put it all together and as far as  Lang 's concerned  Honeywell just needs to re-charge "" Cramer said. ""He could potentially see this $153 stock running up to $170 near the beginning of the new year  which would be stupendous.""
Finally  Cramer and  Lang  inspected the daily chart of United Technologies  an industrial stock with aerospace exposure that has consistently been reaching new highs.
"" Lang  thinks this is a very powerful trend "" Cramer said. "" He  sees the $123 stock possibly going to the $130s before too long  although ideally  he  recommends waiting for a pullback to $120  where UTX has a nice floor of support.""
""It's a good time to be an industrial company  and the charts  as interpreted by Bob Lang  suggest the industrial stocks are going to continue to have a good time right into year-end "" the ""Mad Money"" host concluded. ""He likes Caterpillar  he likes Emerson Electric  Honeywell [and] United Technologies  and I've got to say I agree with him. All we can do is hope that these stocks come in and give us better prices as part of some sort of market-wide sell-off that has nothing to do with their businesses. Why? Because their businesses are red-hot.""","So Cramer called on [TGT]the founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and one of the three minds behind TheStreet.com's Trifecta Stocks newsletter  to see if the industrials' already lengthy rally can continue into the new year.

""Put it all together and this chart's got a lot going for it "" Cramer said. "" [TGT]says Caterpillar is  [TGT]  favorite name in the group  and this combination of positives makes  [TGT]  think the stock could take a run at $155 or even $160 early in the new year.""
[TGT]says the V-shaped bottom pattern tends to be quite bullish —  [TGT]  could see this stock ... take a run at $75 in the not-too-distant future "" Cramer said. ""At the moment  the stock's trading at $66.  [TGT]says  [TGT] 'd love to buy it on a pullback to $63  where Emerson has the support of the 50-day moving average ... but who knows if you'll get that kind of decline?[TGT]said shares of Honeywell may have gotten overheated  but noted a few positives: the pullback happened on lower volume  meaning there aren't any major sellers  and the stock has been holding above its floor of support.
""Put it all together and as far as  Lang 's concerned  Honeywell just needs to re-charge "" Cramer said. ""He could potentially see this $153 stock running up to $170 near the beginning of the new year  which would be stupendous.""
Finally  Cramer and  [TGT]inspected the daily chart of United Technologies  an industrial stock with aerospace exposure that has consistently been reaching new highs.
"" [TGT]thinks this is a very powerful trend "" Cramer said. "" He  sees the $123 stock possibly going to the $130s before too long  although ideally  he  recommends waiting for a pullback to $120  where UTX has a nice floor of support.""
""It's a good time to be an industrial company  and the charts  as interpreted by [TGT]  suggest the industrial stocks are going to continue to have a good time right into year-end "" the ""Mad Money"" host concluded. ""[TGT] likes Caterpillar  [TGT] likes Emerson Electric  Honeywell [and] United Technologies  and I've got to say I agree with [TGT]. All we can do is hope that these stocks come in and give us better prices as part of some sort of market-wide sell-off that has nothing to do with their businesses. Why?

3628,Former DirecTV CEO: Cord cutters don't matter if broadband is the future,Michael White,"Former DirecTV CEO Michael White  isn't too worried about cord cutters.
Recent evidence suggests that large numbers of subscribers  a large share of them being millennials  are actively canceling cable packages. For  White   however  broadband is the future  and already a major revenue generator as more consumers flock to streaming platforms to consume content   he  told CNBC on Thursday.
""The whole issue of the growth in streaming: Millennials' habits are different. There's no question about that ""  White  said. ""You are seeing cord cutting  that's a reality. The advantage is  we can sell broadband still.""
With products like DirecTV Now — an online subscription streaming service made with broadband users in mind — DirecTV and parent company AT&T feel prepared for the shift. However   White  didn't write off the struggle cable-forward companies are facing.
As far as big players in cable go   White  doesn't anticipate  them  picking up wireless to attract or retain customers. While bundled packages  which provide cable  wireless and phone service  may be beneficial for churn   he  recommended those companies stick to what they know.","[TGT]isn't too worried about cord cutters.

3635,Multimillion,Bret Bielema,"When Florida fired Jim McElwain as its football coach  his contract included a stipulation for a $13 million buyout. Because of the peculiar circumstances  the school will likely get by with a much lower figure  around $4 million. Butch Jones is out at Tennessee with a reported buyout of more than $6 million. If Texas A&M were to fire Kevin Sumlin  his buyout is reported at $11 million. Rumors are circulating that Arkansas will fire its head coach   Bret Bielema   at the end of the season with a buyout ranging from $4 to $6 million  depending on the timing.
These large sums generate a lot of head scratching and criticism. For  Bielema  and Jones  their buyouts would be roughly equivalent to a year's pay. For Sumlin  it would be about two years. For McElwain  at the original contracted amount  it approaches three years' worth. In Weis' case  well  it is several.
Of course  the size of the insurance matters. Many of these buyouts diminish through the life of the contract  which complicates comparisons between coaches and players. Had  Bielema  been let go after one year   his  buyout would have amounted to about one-half the total contract value. Now it would be less than half of  his  remaining contract and about one-fifth of the total contract value — figures that are not way out of line with what is seen among NFL players.
What doesn't make sense is giving a player or coach a big insurance policy when they aren't performing very well.  Bielema  received an extension and a new buyout clause coming off less-than-stellar seasons  when  his  market value to other schools would not have been great. The Weis buyout seemed to reflect that Notre Dame way overestimated Weis' value after a single season's improvement.","When Florida fired Jim McElwain as its football coach  his contract included a stipulation for a $13 million buyout.

3636,Sen. Al Franken Reiterates That He Won't Resign In Capitol Hill Remarks : NPR,Al Franken,"Franken  Reiterates  He  Won't Resign: 'I Know That I've Let A Lot Of People Down'
 Sen. Al Franken  said Monday  he  would not resign from office after allegations of sexual harassment have been leveled against  him .
""I know that I've let a lot of people down ""  Franken  said  noting that  he  was looking forward to getting back to work. ""My colleagues  my staff  my supporters and everyone who has counted on  me  to be a champion for women. To all of you  I just want to again say I am sorry. I know there are no magic words I can say to regain your trust.""
 He  said the process will take time and ""that starts with going back to work today.""
The Minnesota Democrat spoke to reporters on Capitol Hill for the first time since multiple women have accused  him  of inappropriate sexual conduct  ranging from forcible kissing to unwanted touching.  He  took a few questions  reiterated that  he  would not resign and expressed remorse and regret.
""I've been trying to take responsibility by apologizing ""  Franken  said.  He  added  ""I'm going to be accountable"" and ""cooperate completely with the ethics investigation.""
 Franken 's conduct has been referred to the Senate Ethics Committee. The committee could recommend anywhere from a reprimand to censure to expulsion  but the full Senate would have to act on that.
Leeanne Tweeden  a radio host in Los Angeles and former model  toured with  Franken  as part of the USO. She recalled  Franken  forcibly kissing her during sketches and rehearsals. A photo taken aboard a cargo plane also shows  Franken  touching Tweeden's breasts over a flak jacket while she was asleep. Looking over  his  shoulder   Franken  smirks at the camera.
 Franken  said  he  didn't remember  his  time with Tweeden the same way  but noted  ""I feel that you have to respect women's experience. I apologized to her  and I meant it. And I was very grateful that she accepted it.""
Women have also accused  Franken  of touching their buttocks while taking photos in Minnesota.  Franken  said  he  does not remember specific instances in which that happened  but  he  did not deny that it did.
""One is too many ""  Franken  said.  He  added that it was disrespectful and  he  is sorry  he  hurt them.
 He  repeated later  ""I am tremendously sorry. ... I am embarrassed. I feel ashamed.""
 Franken 's comments echo what  he  told Minnesota Public Radio News in an interview over the weekend: ""I'm going to go forward. I'm going to take responsibility. I'm going to be held accountable  and I'm going to try to be productive in the way I speak about this.""","""Franken  Reiterates  He  Won't Resign: 'I Know That I've Let A Lot Of People Down

3638,Cowboys' Bryant opens up on struggles nixes idea of pay cut,Dez Bryant,"FILE - In this Dec. 17   2017  file photo  Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant (88)  runs against the Oakland Raiders during the second half of an NFL football game in Oakland   Calif. Bryant  opened up in  his  first lengthy session with reporters in weeks  taking responsibility for a subpar season by saying  he  let frustrations affect  him  during games. But  he  also said some of those frustrations were rooted in the offensive scheme  which  he  said  he  would probably address with owner Jerry Jones and coaches in the offseason.

FRISCO  Texas (AP) —  Dez Bryant  didn't seem sure how to respond when asked if  he  would be willing to take a pay cut after perhaps the most difficult season of the Dallas receiver's career.
Once the 2014 All-Pro came to  his  senses   he  was emphatic.
""Hell no  man ""  Bryant  said Wednesday  three days after the Cowboys were eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to Seattle. ""I believe in me.""
 Bryant  opened up in  his  first lengthy session with reporters in weeks  taking responsibility for a subpar season by saying  he  let frustrations affect  him  during games. But  he  also said some of those frustrations were rooted in the offensive scheme  which  he  said  he  would probably address with owner Jerry Jones and coaches in the offseason.
The eighth-year pro also blamed some of  his  struggles on knee tendinitis  something that hadn't been revealed.  Bryant  was listed on the injury report for three weeks earlier in the season  including one week when  he  missed two practices when an ankle injury also was listed.
But  Bryant  didn't miss any games  and is on the verge of going all 16 without a 100-yard outing for the first time in  his  career unless  he  sits for a meaningless finale Sunday at Philadelphia. In  his  second season in 2011   Bryant  didn't reach 100 yards in 15 games  missing one for injury.
""I consider  myself  a warrior ""  Bryant  said. ""If I can walk  I can move  I'm going to go out there and try to play. That's probably dumb  but hey  that's just who I am. I love this game  and I try to push it  but for the most part  yeah  I have been pretty banged up.""
Injuries are part of the reason  Bryant  hasn't lived up to the $70 million  five-year contract  he  signed after  his  All-Pro season.  He  had career lows across the board in 2015 because of foot and ankle issues that kept  him  out of seven games.
A knee injury knocked  him  out of three games last year  but  he  was productive otherwise and capped the season with 132 yards and two touchdowns in the top-seeded Cowboys' playoff loss to Green Bay.
In the three years before the big contract   Bryant  averaged 91 catches  1 312 yards and 14 touchdowns per season. With a game  he  might not play remaining  the averages in the three years since are 49 catches  671 yards and six TDs.
""I'm a grown man  and I should be able to sit there and have my frustrations in check  regardless of whatever the situation might be ""  Bryant  said. ""All I know is if my mind's not cluttered  I can beat whoever  whenever  anybody at any time. It's just sometimes I let certain things get to me that I shouldn't.""
Offensive coordinator Scott Linehan brushed off  Bryant 's comments about the scheme  saying it's the same one Dallas used on a franchise-record 11-game winning streak last season during the sensational rookie years for quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott.
 Bryant  has by far the most targets on the team with 124  but has connected with Prescott just 53 percent of the time (66 catches). Again   Bryant  pointed to the staff  which didn't seem to bother coach Jason Garrett.
The Cowboys could save $12.5 million in cap room by designating Bryant as a post-June 1 cut. While  Bryant  dismissed as ""dumb"" a question about whether  he  wanted to remain with Dallas   he  didn't ignore the idea of ending up elsewhere.
""If that came about  I'm still  Dez Bryant  ""  he  said. ""I'm still going over the top. If it's there where I can grab it  I'm going to grab it. That's just who I am.""","FILE - In this Dec. 17   2017  file photo  [TGT]runs against the Oakland Raiders during the second half of an NFL football game in Oakland   [TGT]opened up in  [TGT]  first lengthy session with reporters in weeks  taking responsibility for a subpar season by saying  [TGT]  let frustrations affect  [TGT]  during games.

The only strange part of the decision is that  Hocutt  had said Tuesday there was “very little separation between teams five through eight.”

People are talking about making the electrical grid more resilient. That means not only making  it  more reliable  so that  it ’s less likely to fail  but also better at putting  itself  back together if pieces of  it  collapse. I think that this sort of thing deserves at least as much attention as cyberdefense efforts designed to frustrate hackers. All sorts of things besides hackers could bring down the grid: A massive solar flare  an EMP attack  a software “bug” rather than a hack. The better the grid is at recovering  the better it will be if any of them happen.
The Bitcoin bubble bursts:  Bitcoin  has been skyrocketing  and I confess that I wish I’d put  say  a thousand bucks into  it  a few years back  when my crypto-enthusiast friends were encouraging me to. But many people think  it ’s in a bubble  and all bubbles burst. Perhaps they’re wrong  but if they’re right  many people — especially in Asia  where millions of investors are driving up the price according to the Wall Street Journal — will wind up losing their shirts and angry. Asia doesn’t need destabilizing right now  with North Korea and China rattling sabers. (And for added fun  North Korea is hacking  Bitcoin  exchanges.)
There’s not much bankers and regulators can do to stop a bubble bursting  but they should be ready for its possibility. And ordinary folks can prepare by keeping their debt and spending on a tight leash  which is a good idea anyway. Or maybe it’s not a bubble  and I’m missing out by not buying  Bitcoin  even at  its  current soaring price. By way of comfort  that would be consistent with my investment performance.

Richard Matt   one of the escaped inmates from the Clinton Correctional Facility in northern New York  has been killed by police officers  reports say.
After nearly three weeks on the run  one of the two convicted murderers who broke out of a New York state prison has been killed. Officers tracked down  Richard Matt  in northern New York.  He  was shot near a cabin where investigators said earlier that they had found evidence of at least one of the escaped prisoners. Zach Hirsch of North Country Public Radio is on the line to talk about the latest developments. Hi  Zach.
MARTIN: New York governor  Andrew Cuomo  had a news conference tonight  and  along with police officials  spoke about how  Richard Matt  was killed. What details did they give?
HIRSCH: So they said there had been these burglaries in the area over the last few days. And then someone reported that their RV was shot at  so police came to that area where they - and they found a cabin where  Richard Matt  had been. And Joseph D'Amico of the New York State Police detailed what happened next.
D'AMICO: A tactical team met up with  Matt  in the woods  challenged  him   and  he  was shot dead by border patrol at that time. We recovered a .20 gauged shotgun from  Matt 's body at the location.
MARTIN: What about the other convict  David Sweat? Do we assume  he 's still at large?
HIRSCH: Yes. So there's no reason to think  he  wasn't with  Richard Matt   but no one has actually reported seeing  him . And they said  he  could still be out there.
HIRSCH: Yeah. So these are men who committed some really brutal crimes. They're both convicted murderers serving life sentences. David Sweat murdered a sheriff's deputy.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Beyonce  has released a new single and video to help with relief efforts following the recent natural disasters in the Caribbean and Mexico.
âI am donating my proceeds from this song to hurricane relief charities for Puerto Rico  Mexico and the other affected Caribbean islands â  Beyonce  said on her Instagram page on Thursday.
The remix by  Beyonce   featuring home videos of ordinary people dancing  is expected to push sales higher and by Friday had already been viewed more than 1.8 million times.
 Beyonce  also lent  her  support to relief efforts in  her  home town of Houston  Texas  sending a taped message to a charity telethon earlier in September that raised more than $44 million for the victims of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
âNatural disasters donât discriminate. They donât see if youâre an immigrant  black or white  Hispanic or Asian  Jewish or Muslim  wealthy or poor ... weâre all in this together â  she  said at the time.

3645,Criminal Referral Confirms Memo's Explosive Claims Of FISA Abuse,Christopher Steele,"A criminal referral from top Senate investigators confirms explosive charges in last weekâs House Intelligence Committee memo regarding abuse of surveillance authorities at the FBI and Department of Justice. It also reveals a host of problems arising from the bureauâs cooperation with  foreign investigator Christopher Steele   who was working on behalf of Hillary Clintonâs presidential campaign. The eight-page memo from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) includes underlying evidence to support the claims.
âIt appears the FBI relied on admittedly uncorroborated information  funded by and obtained for Secretary Clintonâs presidential campaign  in order to conduct surveillance of an associate of the opposing presidential candidate. It did so based on  Mr. Steele âs personal credibility and presumably having faith in his process of obtaining the information. But there is substantial evidence suggesting that  Mr. Steele  materially misled the FBI about a key aspect of  his  dossier efforts  one which bears on  his  credibility â Sens. Graham and Grassley wrote.
The letter describes a verification effort before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) so inadequate it resembles a concerted effort to conceal information from the court. However  the senators blame Steeleâs âapparent deceptionâ for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) failures by FBI and Justice  and refer  Steele  for investigation of violating federal law regarding making false statements to the U.S. government. The letter also reveals Clinton associates were feeding  Steele  allegations that  he  used in  his  reports.
A salacious and unverified dossier formed an essential part of the application to secure a warrant against a Trump campaign affiliate named Carter Page. This application failed to reveal that the dossier was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. The application presented a Yahoo News article as corroboration for the dossier  when in fact it was sourced to the dossierâs author Christopher Steele. The wife of a high-ranking Justice Department official also worked on behalf of the Clinton campaign effort  and her husband Bruce Ohr funneled her research into the Department of Justice. Although he admitted that  Steele  âwas desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president â this and the Ohrsâ relationship with the Clinton campaign was concealed from the secret court that grants surveillance warrants. The dossier was âonly minimally corroboratedâ and unverified  according to FBI officials.
Evidence supporting all of these claims is included in a less redacted version of the senatorsâ January 4  2018  referral made publicly available late Tuesday evening. A highly redacted version of the referral was made publicly available the previous day  causing Grassley to ask the FBI to aim for more transparency. The FBI had previously attempted to keep the public from learning details of its relationship with  Steele   leading Grassley to publicly decry a âbureaucratic game of hide the ballâ by the FBI and DOJ.
According to the senators  the FBI relied on dossier author Steeleâs alleged credibility â as opposed to corroboration or verification of his salacious and improbable claims â for the initial warrant application and its three renewals. The application also mentioned a Yahoo News article  but not only didnât mention the article was sourced to an anonymous  Steele   it positively claimed it wasnât.
Reporter Michael Isikoff recently confirmed that  Steele  was obviously  his  source for the article  and that Clintonâs Russia dossier project head Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS was a longtime friend. The FBI stated to the court that  Steele  had nothing to do with the article. Shopping his unverified allegations to the media was contrary to Steeleâs agreement with the FBI. Even after  Steele  publicly testified about  his  many media contacts  the FBI hid that part of  his  dossier operation from the court and continued to rely on  his  credibility for surveillance reauthorization.
[REDACTED]  the application attempts to explain away the inconsistency between Mr. Steeleâs assertion to the FBI and the existence of the article  apparently to shield Mr. Steeleâs credibility on which it still relied for the renewal request. The application to the FISC said: âGiven that the information contained in the September 23rd news article generally matches the information about Page that [ Steele ] discovered doing  his /her research  [REDACTED] The FBI does not believe that [ Steele ] directly provided this information to the pressâ (emphasis added).
Even After Terminating  Steele  For Unauthorized Contacts With Media  FBI Claimed He Hadnât Talked To Yahoo
In footnote 9 of its January 2017 application to renew the FISA warrant for Mr. Page  the FBI again addressed Mr. Steeleâs credibility. At that time  the FBI noted that it had suspended its relationship with  Mr. Steele  in October 2016 because of Steeleâs âunauthorized disclosure of information to the press.â â¦ In defending  Mr. Steeleâs  credibility to the FISC  the FBI had posited an innocuous explanation for the September 23 article  based on the assumption that  Mr. Steele  had told the FBI the truth about  his  press contacts. The FBI then vouched for  him  twice more  using the same rationale  in subsequent renewal applications filed with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in April and June 2017.
 Steele  Was So Political  He  Flagrantly Violated  His  FBI Agreement Over Reopening Of Clinton Investigation
The FBI relayed that  Steele  had been bothered by the FBIâs notification to Congress in October 2016 and the reopening of the Clinton investigation  and as a result â[ Steele ] independently and against the prior admonishment from the FBI to speak only with the FBI on this matter  released the reporting discussed herein [dossier allegations against Page] to an identified news organization.â However the FBI continued to cite  Mr. Steele âs past work as evidence of  his  reliability  and stated that âthe incident that led to the FBI suspending its relationship with [Mr. Steele] occurred after [Mr. Steele] providedâ the FBI with the dossier information described in the application. The FBI further asserted in footnote 19 that it did not believe that  Steele  directly gave information to Yahoo News that âpublished the September 23 News Article.â
Even After  Steele  Publicly Admitted In Court To His Media Operation  The FBI Hid It
In  Steele âs sworn court filings in litigation in London   he  admitted that  he  âgave off the record briefings to a small number of journalists about the pre-election memoranda [i.e.  the dossier] in late summer/autumn 2016.â In another sworn filing in that case   Mr. Steele  further stated that journalists from âthe New York Times  the Washington Post  Yahoo News  the New Yorker  and CNNâ were âbriefed at the end of September 2016 by [ Steele ] and Fusion at Fusionâs instruction.âThe filing further states that  Mr. Steele â subsequently participated in further meetings at Fusionâs instruction with Fusion and the New York Times  the Washington Post  and Yahoo News  which took place mid-October 2016.ââ¦ The first of these filings was publicly reported in the U.S. media in April of 2017  yet the FBI did not subsequently disclose to the ISC this evidence suggesting that  Mr. Steele  had lied to the FBI. Instead the application still relied primarily on  his  credibility prior to the October media incident.
Court Wasnât Told  Steele  Was âDesperateâ To Keep Trump From Being Elected
The FBI received similar information from a Justice Department official  Bruce Ohr  who maintained contacts with Mr. Simpson and  Mr. Steele  about their dossier work  and whose wife also worked for Fusion GPS on the Russia project. REDACTED  He  also noted in the same interview that  Mr. Steele  was âdesperateâ to see that Mr. Trump was not elected president. None of the information provided by Mr. Ohr in his interviews with the FBI was included in the FISA renewal applications  despite its relevance to whether  Mr. Steele  had lied to the FBI about  his  contacts with the media as well as its broader relevance to  his  credibility and  his  stated political motive.","A criminal referral from top Senate investigators confirms explosive charges in last weekâs House Intelligence Committee memo regarding abuse of surveillance authorities at the FBI and Department of Justice.

3650,After Mugabe 's Fall the Crocodile Takes Charge in Zimbabwe,Robert Mugabe,"As news emerged that  President Robert Mugabe  a one-time freedom fighter who has ruled the southern African nation with an iron fist for 37 years   had resigned  his  post  the streets of Zimbabweâs capital erupted in joy. Through the night  the Zimbabwean capital echoed with exuberant car horn blasts as revelers danced.
In neighboring South Africa  members of the Zimbabwean diaspora celebrated with raucous singing and firework displays. Many of them hold  Mugabe  responsible for their exileâthe country  once the breadbasket of southern Africa  has seen the economy collapse under his rule  sending an estimated three million Zimbabweans across the border in search of employment. âThis is a new beginning for Zimbabwe â beamed Yolanda Nyngana  a 23-year-old interior designer who works as a housekeeper in Cape Town. â This Mugabe    he  has been so bad for our country. Even people with an education have no jobs  but  his  family has been living off the countryâs wealth for years. We lost everything because of  this man .â
 Mugabe âs resignation capped a tense week that started with the military placing the president under house arrest on Nov. 14. Though the move had all the markings of a coup  military leaders insisted that they were instead clearing out the âcriminalsâ that had undermined the presidentâs leadership  most likely a reference to supporters of his wife  Grace Mugabe  who has been angling to succeed the 93-year-old in the presidency.
Protestors took to the streets when the President refused to step down  prompting  his party  to suspend him  and parliament to launch impeachment proceedings. As the initial proceedings concluded in parliament on Nov. 21  members of Mugabeâs cabinet rushed in with a letter of resignation from the President. âMy decision to resign â¦. arises from my concern for the welfare of the people of Zimbabwe and my desire to ensure a smooth  peaceful and non-violent transfer of power that underpins national security  peace and stability â the President wrote. As the speaker of the house read it aloud  parliamentarians cheered.
Thatâs because many feel that  Mugabe âs successor  former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa  will carry on much as before when  he  is sworn in on Friday. The two worked side by side for much of the Presidentâs reign. In a diplomatic cable posted on Wikileaks in 2000  the U.S. State Department noted that Mnangagwa was âwidely feared and despised throughout the countryâ and âcould be an even more repressive leaderâ than  Mugabe .  He  remains on the U.S. sanctions list  along with General Constantino Chiwenga  the military leader who helped push  Mugabe  out of power  for  his  role in repressing democracy in Zimbabwe. Kenneth Roth  the executive director of Human Rights Watch  tweeted photos of  Mugabe  and Mnangagwa next to each other. âZimbabweâs dictator finally resigns. Now donât replace him with another.â
He was appointed vice president in 2014  and  at the time  was widely assumed to be  Mugabe âs chosen successor. It was Mugabeâs abrupt dismissal of Mnangagwa  on Nov. 7  that precipitated the militaryâs intervention. While  Mugabe  cited disloyalty  most in government saw it as an attempt by  Grace Mugabe  to insert herself into the succession race by taking  his  place as vice president. At this point  Ms. Mugabeâs whereabouts are unknown.
Interior designer-turned-housemaid Nyngana agrees. âAnyone is better than  Mugabe  â she says. More to the point  the threat of upcoming elections is likely to keep Mnangagwa in line  and force him to implement at least some of the changes Zimbabweans want to see. Inflation is so high in Zimbabwe at the moment that relatives ask her to send groceries home from South Africa instead of money. âIf Mnangagwa wants to win  he will make sure that people can afford cooking oil again  at the very least â she says. She might even head home for the elections  her first trip back in nearly three years. âI was never interested in voting before  because we already knew who was going to win. This time I can choose the person who I think is best for Zimbabwe.â And  if all goes well  the person after that.","As news emerged that  President Robert Mugabe  a one-time freedom fighter who has ruled the southern African nation with an iron fist for 37 years   had resigned  his  post  the streets of Zimbabweâs capital erupted in joy.

Even people with an education have no jobs  but  his  family has been living off the countryâs wealth for years. We lost everything because of  this man .â
 Mugabe âs resignation capped a tense week that started with the military placing the president under house arrest on Nov. 14. Though the move had all the markings of a coup  military leaders insisted that they were instead clearing out the âcriminalsâ that had undermined the presidentâs leadership  most likely a reference to supporters of his wife  Grace Mugabe  who has been angling to succeed the 93-year-old in the presidency.
Protestors took to the streets when the President refused to step down  prompting  his party  to suspend him  and parliament to launch impeachment proceedings. As the initial proceedings concluded in parliament on Nov. 21  members of Mugabeâs cabinet rushed in with a letter of resignation from the President. âMy decision to resign â¦. arises from my concern for the welfare of the people of Zimbabwe and my desire to ensure a smooth  peaceful and non-violent transfer of power that underpins national security  peace and stability â the President wrote. As the speaker of the house read it aloud  parliamentarians cheered.
Thatâs because many feel that  Mugabe âs successor  former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa  will carry on much as before when  he  is sworn in on Friday. The two worked side by side for much of the Presidentâs reign. In a diplomatic cable posted on Wikileaks in 2000  the U.S. State Department noted that Mnangagwa was âwidely feared and despised throughout the countryâ and âcould be an even more repressive leaderâ than  [TGT]  .   [TGT]   remains on the U.S. sanctions list  along with General Constantino Chiwenga  the military leader who helped push  Mugabe  out of power  for   [TGT]   role in repressing democracy in Zimbabwe. Kenneth Roth  the executive director of Human Rights Watch  tweeted photos of  Mugabe  and Mnangagwa next to each other. âZimbabweâs dictator finally resigns. Now donât replace him with another.â
He was appointed vice president in 2014  and  at the time  was widely assumed to be  Mugabe âs chosen successor. It was Mugabeâs abrupt dismissal of Mnangagwa  on Nov. 7  that precipitated the militaryâs intervention. While  Mugabe  cited disloyalty  most in government saw it as an attempt by  Grace Mugabe  to insert herself into the succession race by taking  his  place as vice president. At this point  Ms. Mugabeâs whereabouts are unknown.
Interior designer-turned-housemaid Nyngana agrees. âAnyone is better than  Mugabe  â she says. More to the point  the threat of upcoming elections is likely to keep Mnangagwa in line  and force him to implement at least some of the changes Zimbabweans want to see. Inflation is so high in Zimbabwe at the moment that relatives ask her to send groceries home from South Africa instead of money. âIf Mnangagwa wants to win  he will make sure that people can afford cooking oil again  at the very least â she says. She might even head home for the elections  her first trip back in nearly three years. âI was never interested in voting before  because we already knew who was going to win. This time I can choose the person who I think is best for Zimbabwe.â And  if all goes well  the person after that.",Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,,,,,,,,,

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady  in the midst of another controversy  deflected in a news conference Thursday when asked multiple questions about an ESPN story that depicted  Brady  as being celebratory when New England traded former backup Jimmy Garoppolo in October.
âNot to us players  I think â  Brady  said when asked if reaction to the article has become a distraction. âWe do what we always do and show up to work and try to do the best we can do. Thereâs a lot at stake and I think everyone has put a lot into it.
The ESPN story depicted discord among  Brady   coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft  with a hint that the dysfunction could ultimately bring an end to the trioâs working relationship at some point. As the Patriots gear up for Saturdayâs divisional-round playoff game against the Tennessee Titans and look to defend their Super Bowl championship  the focus for many outside the organization is on the teamâs future beyond this season
âI think we have a job to do and we know what that job is and itâs to go out and play football at a high level and play well â  Brady  continued. âNothing really should get in the way of that. Thatâs what we get paid for  to be a professional and put everything aside and go out there and do the best you can for the team and try to win.â
Previously in a radio show on Tuesday   Brady  called the articleâs portrayal of  Brady  celebrating the Garoppolo trade a âpoor characterization.â
The article came at a time when Brady  who turned 40 years old in August  had endured some recent struggles. In the span from Week 12 to 16   Brady  threw six interceptions. Before that stretch   he  had only thrown two.
Earlier this week   Brady âs camp also released a trailer for a documentary that takes a closer look at  Brady âs personal life  Tom vs. Time.
âThatâs a good question â  Brady  said when asked what  he  hoped viewers would get out of it. âThis is about Tennessee. Weâre two days out from the biggest game of the year. Weâll see after the Tennessee game.â","[TGT]  . (Photo: David Butler II  USA TODAY Sports)

3653,Germanyâs SPD Backs Merkel Coalition Talks After Divisive Vote,Angela Merkel,"Germanyâs Social Democrats backed formal coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel after a divisive party convention  marking a potential breakthrough toward her fourth term.
 Merkel  hailed the âpositive resultâ in Bonn before meeting with fellow leaders of  her  CDU in Berlin to lay out the negotiating path ahead. With coalition talks able to begin as soon as Tuesday  the end of a four-month political stalemate is on the horizon  enabling  Merkel  to move toward re-inauguration possibly by mid-March. The euro rose in early Asian trading.
Sundayâs convention had been seen as the biggest obstacle to  Merkel âs plan to govern with the SPD   her  partner of the past four years. Yet the vote was carried only after pledges by the leadership to win greater concessions from  Merkelâs  bloc in the talks to come. The upshot is that the partyâs decision to give its members the final say over any coalition pact is emerging as a bigger-than-expected hurdle to a renewal of the grand coalition.
Five hours of impassioned debate pitted establishment figures against young and leftist grass-roots members  who rejected governing with  Merkel  in favor of a period of renewal in opposition. Kevin Kuehnert  head of the SPDâs youth wing  argued that such a course âcan be the beginning of a new story that we write together.â
Schulz  who led the SPD to its worst result since World War II in Septemberâs inconclusive election  made the case for another tie-up by pledging to press  Merkel âs bloc for expanded commitments on health care  hardship rules for refugees who want to bring family members to Germany and curbing layoffs of temporary workers.
A go-ahead from party members is far from guaranteed  said Matthias Miersch  head of the SPDâs left-wing caucus.  Merkel âs bloc ânow has to shiftâ on policy  he said.
 Merkel  is already returning to the world stage  visiting French President Emmanuel Macron last Friday and scheduling her first speech in three years to the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  for Wednesday.
Dealing with the record influx of more than 1 million refugees since 2015 may pose a more pressing challenge to a coalition of  Merkel  and the Social Democrats  who have governed together for eight of her 12 years in office. Germans view migration as the most urgent matter for the next government to deal with  according to an Infratest Dimap poll for Handelsblatt newspaper published this month.
For  Merkel   the Social Democratic vote offers some relief  Carsten Nickel  a managing director with Teneo Intelligence in Brussels  said by email. âBut the real test is of course still ahead.â","Germanyâs Social Democrats backed formal coalition talks with  [TGT]  after a divisive party convention  marking a potential breakthrough toward her fourth term.

3654,Conservative writer selectively edits Chuck Schumer to accuse him of racism â ThinkProgress,Chuck Schumer,"On Wednesday   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY)  gave a brief speech where  he  criticized Senate Republicans for applying different rules to Trump judicial nominees than they applied to President Obamaâs  chided Donald Trump for naming almost exclusively white judges  and announced that  he  would not vote for Marvin Quattlebaum  a newly confirmed district judge. It was the kind of routine speech that Senate leaders give every week. And itâs now fueling a massive right-wing hate fest against  Schumer .
On Thursday  the Daily Wireâs Ben Shapiro published a piece with the provocative title âRACISM IN ACTION:  Schumer : I Wonât Vote For This Judge Because Heâs White.â Itâs not an honest piece or an even remotely accurate one  but boy did it pop in certain dark corners of the Internet! According to NewsWhip  a service that monitors news traffic across various media outlets  Shapiroâs claim that  Schumer  is the Real Racistâ¢ was briefly the hottest story on the Internet.
Shapiro builds his piece around a selectively edited video. That video cuts off earlier parts of the speech  where  Schumer  notes that the only reason why Trump was able to nominate someone to fill this vacant seat is âbecause two Republican senators from South Carolina refused to return a blue slip for two judges nominated for the same vacancy by President Obama.â
After expressing concern about this double standard   Schumer  also raised a second objection. âThe nomination of Marvin Quattlebaum speaks to the overall lack of diversity in President Trumpâs selections for the federal judiciary â  Schumer  noted. âAs of February 14th  83 percent of the President Trumpâs confirmed nominees were male  92 percent were white.â
In any event  if  Schumer  actually were refusing to vote for Quattlebaum simply because the newly confirmed judge is white  that would be a major shift by the minority leader. Besides Quattlebaum  the Senate confirmed a total of 11 Trump nominees to federal district courts.  Schumer  voted for 10 of these 11 nominees â Quattlebaum is  his  first ânoâ vote. All of the ten nominees  Schumer  supported  according to the Federal Judicial Center  are white.
The problem here  in other words  isnât that  Schumer  wonât support any white people named to the federal bench. Itâs that Trump  who once claimed that a sitting federal judge could not be fair because of the judgeâs âMexican heritage â appears unwilling to name virtually any judges who arenât white.","On Wednesday    [TGT] )  gave a brief speech where   [TGT]   criticized Senate Republicans for applying different rules to Trump judicial nominees than they applied to President Obamaâs  chided Donald Trump for naming almost exclusively white judges  and announced that  he  would not vote for Marvin Quattlebaum  a newly confirmed district judge.

 It  also raised questions about the decision-making for the redesign. The school had decided  it  needed a new uniform last summer   principal Toshitsugu Wada  told the local education board. But parents first learned that the uniforms would be designed by Armani in November  when  Wada  sent a letter to the school community announcing  his  decision and justifying the luxury childrenswear by deeming the school a âGinza landmark.â
The English-language Asahi Shimbun news site reported that when the education board asked whether plans for a new uniform could be scrapped   Wada  told them that the old uniform was no longer being produced. The Armani design is scheduled to be introduced in April.
At a news conference on Friday   Wada  said that  he  chose Armani because the brand operated a boutique near the school and because it would fit Taimei's identity as a âschool of Ginza.â  Wada  said that the controversy surrounding the choice had not changed his belief that the cost of the new uniforms was worth it  according to news agency reports.","The backlash has brought unwanted attention to Taimei Elementary  which dates  its  history from the late 19th century and whose well-known ivy-covered school building is just blocks away from Tokyo's most expensive real estate.

3659,Cadet Run Out of West Point After Accusing Armyâs Star Quarterback of Rape,Ahmad Ali Bradshaw,"Three weeks into the 2014 school year  Lewis  who was still on crutches and needed surgery  says she met  Ahmad Ali Bradshaw   a West Point quarterback who was best friends with her roommate.
One night  as Lewis later told West Point investigators  she came back to her room after a shower.  Bradshaw  was there and  she claimed   he  raped her.
 Bradshaw  denied having any sexual contact with Lewis at all  according to an internal investigation report obtained by The Daily Beast.  Bradshaw  also chose to not render an official statement and invoked  his  right to remain silent.
West Pointâs internal investigation concluded that a consensual sexual relationship between the cadets had occurred  and a second investigation  by the Army Criminal Investigation Division and the Staff Judge Advocate  found there was âinsufficient evidenceâ to charge  Bradshaw  with sexual assault.
 Bradshaw  declined to comment on the allegations when contacted by a Daily Beast reporter  and West Point denied an interview with  Bradshaw   saying in an email that it was a âreally busy time given the classroom environment and the upcoming Army Navy activities.â
The annual rivalry game is Saturday and  Bradshaw   a team captain  is expected to start as quarterback.
Despite  Bradshaw âs denial of sex  West Pointâs internal investigation led by Maj. Damon M. Torres concluded that a sexual relationship between the cadets had indeed occurred  but Torres called it consensual. It is unclear from the documents how Torres arrived at that conclusion  and West Point declined to share specifics  citing privacy for both parties.
Nevertheless   Bradshaw  was charged with a violation of Article 1 of the Cadet Disciplinary Code for improper use of government facilities by way of âsexual activity  which includes  but is not limited to: kissing  hand holding  and fondling â according to West Point regulations.
Torres recommended  Bradshaw  be punished with a Brigade Board  one of the most serious blemishes a cadet can receive on their record  and be enrolled in the Respect Mentorship Program  according to West Point documents viewed by The Daily Beast. The program is designed to âeducate cadets on moral-ethical topics  to challenge them with critical thinking experiences  and to provide structured reflection.â
A second investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division and the Staff Judge Advocate  who advises West Point leaders on legal matters  found there was âinsufficient evidenceâ to charge  Bradshaw  with sexual assault.  Bradshaw  was suspended from football for the duration of the criminal investigation  West Point told The Daily Beast in an email. West Point had previously attributed  his  absence from the field to âan unspecified Academy matter .â
People were writing that she should be âtaken out backâ and shot  âlike Old Yeller â according to screenshots viewed by The Daily Beast. Other cadets called Lewis âthe whore of the corps â and said  Bradshaw âs suspension had cost them the Army-Navy game in 2014. When Lewis complained to  her  superiors  the cadets just took their chatter to a private Facebook group   she  says.
Meanwhile   Bradshaw  became West Pointâs star quarterback. He scored the game-winning touchdown against Navy last year  breaking Armyâs 14-game losing streak to its archrival.
But perhaps  Bradshaw  shouldnât have been playing at all.
According to a document provided by the Army source   Bradshaw  has been the subject of numerous negative conduct reports besides the one involving Lewisâeven violating West Pointâs famed honor code for cheating in 2016  which should have seen  him  benched for the 2016 fall season but did not.
West Point separated 56 cadets in 2016  10 for honor violations and 18 for other misconduct conduct.  Bradshaw  was not among them despite being found guilty of âlying/cheatingâ by a Cadet Honor Committee at West Point in May 2016.

3662,What a federal government shutdown means in Chicago,Ruben Castillo,"U.S. District Court Chief Judge Ruben Castillo  told the Tribune on Friday that if the shutdown happens  the courts have enough money in reserve to keep operating normally into the first week of February.
âBut after that  thatâs where we run into problems â  he  said in a telephone interview. âWe would have to put together a contingency plan to figure out what we would need to do.â
 Castillo  said the first thing that would likely happen in a fiscal emergency would be to âshut down trials â particularly in civil cases.
Trials are expensive to run because jury pools have to be assembled and the courts pay travel and other expenses to jurors  sometimes for weeks at a time   he  said.
Other contingency plans include furloughing nonessential court employees and canceling criminal trials for defendants who are not in custody when there is no danger of violating the accusedâs constitutional right to a speedy trial   Castillo  said.
âYou end up triaging justice  and thatâs just not fair â  he  said.
Itâs not the first time  Castillo  has had to deal with this issue.  He  had been on the job for less than three months when the 2013 shutdown occurred.
 Castillo  told the Tribune then that if the stalemate hadnât been resolved   he  was prepared to send a doomsday email that would have halted all trials at the busy downtown courthouse because  he  had no more money to pay jurors and court-appointed attorneys or cover other costs of a trial. Officials in Washington had told  him  to give jurors IOUs for their service if necessary â something  he  refused to do.","[TGT] told the Tribune on Friday that if the shutdown happens  the courts have enough money in reserve to keep operating normally into the first week of February.

3664,Woman who pleaded guilty in fiance's kayak death: 'I have to let it go',Courtesy Angelika Graswald,"Angelika Graswald  was facing the possibility of a life sentence nearly three years ago. But four days before Christmas 2017   she  walked out of Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York state  focusing on rebuilding  her  life.
 Graswald  made headlines when  she  was charged with murder in the second degree and manslaughter in the second degree in the drowning of  her  fiancÃ©  Vincent Viafore. She pleaded not guilty.
The then 35-year-old was living with Viafore in Poughkeepsie  New York. Both had been married before. They planned to tie the knot on a beach on the Baltic Sea in  her  home country  Latvia.

On their return back across the river several hours later   Graswald  said Viafore  who wasnât wearing a life jacket  capsized in the rough waves and drowned. Prosecutors claimed  Graswald  was responsible for his death because  she  had removed a connector ring from his paddle and the drain plug from the kayak.
After an 11-hour police interrogation   Graswald  was arrested.  She  was officially indicted for second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in May 2015 after Viaforeâs body was recovered from the river  and pleaded not guilty to both charges.
Weeks before the case was set to go to trial   Graswald  reached an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to the lesser felony charge of criminally negligent homicide in July 2017  in which  she  admitted  she  should have perceived the risks associated with being out on the water that day.
On Nov. 8  2017   Graswald  was sentenced to one and a half to four years in state prison  the maximum allowed for criminally negligent homicide  in Vincent Viafore's death.  She  was released from Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women the following month after serving just over two and a half years behind bars.
 Graswald  has always maintained  she  never intended to kill Viafore.
 Her  defense attorney  Richard Portale  says Viafore was also responsible. Portale told 20/20  âI'm not here to blame Mr. Viafore for his own death  but the truth is  he wasn't wearing a life vest. He wasn't wearing a wet suit.

3666,âHome of Sliced Breadâ: A small Missouri town champions its greatest thing,Otto Rohwedder,"An original design of  Otto Rohwedderâs  bread slicer. (Greater Chillicothe Visitors Region)
 Rohwedder  didnât set out to become an inventor.  He  earned a degree in optics in 1900 from the Northern Illinois College of Ophthalmology and Otology in Chicago. Then  he  moved to Missouri  where  he  eventually operated three jewelry stores in St. Joseph  about 70 miles west of Chillicothe.
On the side   he  tinkered with a design for a mechanized bread slicer. In 1916   he  sold  his  jewelry business and moved back to  his  home town of Davenport  Iowa  to focus  his  energy on the slicer and recuperate from an illness.
 Otto Rohwedder   left  and Frank Bench (Greater Chillicothe Visitors Region/Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune)
 Rohwedder  wasnât the first to attempt making an automated bread slicer  according to the Atlantic: âWhile the earlier bread-cutting devices using parallel blades appear in America in the 1860s  they sat on the shelf for decades  awaiting the introduction of other machines capable of producing loaves of uniform shape  size and consistency.â
As he improved his invention   Rohwedder  sought feedback from homemakers to determine how thick to cut the slices (half an inch).  He  also had to find a way to ensure the bread would stay fresh once it was sliced. First   he  inserted large U-shaped pins at both ends of the bread to keep the pieces from separating. Then  he  created a process so that the bread was quickly sealed in a bag after being sliced.
âSliced bread was here to stay and the baking industry was beating a path to Rohwedderâs door â the Chillicothe newspaper reported. âOver the next 14 months   Rohwedder  took orders for more than 230 bread slicing machines from bakeries through the country.â
Although  Rohwedder  saw  his  vision realized   he  was forced to sell  his  patent rights in 1933 during the Great Depression  reportedly to the Micro-Westco Co. of Bettendorf  Iowa  where  he  became vice president and sales manager of the Rohwedder Bakery Machine Division.  He  died in Michigan in 1960 at age 80.
In Chillicothe  Bench ran  his  bakery a few more years before going into another line of work.
Chillicothe had other records to prove its claim. âWe had newspaper articles â a record of history â said Catherine Stortz Ripley  the Constitution-Tribuneâs editor and the journalist who rediscovered the townâs bread history. Additional documentation was found in  Otto Rohwedderâs  scrapbook  which  his  son shared during  his  visit.

 Rohwedder  didnât set out to become an inventor.  He  earned a degree in optics in 1900 from the Northern Illinois College of Ophthalmology and Otology in Chicago. Then  he  moved to Missouri  where  he  eventually operated three jewelry stores in St. Joseph  about 70 miles west of Chillicothe.
On the side   he  tinkered with a design for a mechanized bread slicer. In 1916   he  sold  his  jewelry business and moved back to  his  home town of Davenport  Iowa  to focus  his  energy on the slicer and recuperate from an illness.
  [TGT]    left  and Frank Bench (Greater Chillicothe Visitors Region/Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune)
 Rohwedder  wasnât the first to attempt making an automated bread slicer  according to the Atlantic: âWhile the earlier bread-cutting devices using parallel blades appear in America in the 1860s  they sat on the shelf for decades  awaiting the introduction of other machines capable of producing loaves of uniform shape  size and consistency.â
As he improved his invention   Rohwedder  sought feedback from homemakers to determine how thick to cut the slices (half an inch).  He  also had to find a way to ensure the bread would stay fresh once it was sliced. First   he  inserted large U-shaped pins at both ends of the bread to keep the pieces from separating. Then  he  created a process so that the bread was quickly sealed in a bag after being sliced.
âSliced bread was here to stay and the baking industry was beating a path to Rohwedderâs door â the Chillicothe newspaper reported. âOver the next 14 months   Rohwedder  took orders for more than 230 bread slicing machines from bakeries through the country.â
Although  Rohwedder  saw  his  vision realized   he  was forced to sell  his  patent rights in 1933 during the Great Depression  reportedly to the Micro-Westco Co. of Bettendorf  Iowa  where  he  became vice president and sales manager of the Rohwedder Bakery Machine Division.  He  died in Michigan in 1960 at age 80.

3671,Bradley Bealâs career,Bradley Beal,"After the Washington Wizards experienced a night they would rather forget   Bradley Beal  single-handedly provided new memories.
 Beal  turned a Tuesday night game against the Portland Trail Blazers into  his  personal masterpiece: driving the lane to attack the rim  using  his  body to shield off defenders and clearing space in the midrange and rising without hesitation from deep beyond the three-point arc. By the end   Beal  had crafted the finest scoring game of  his  career  helping the Wizards move past one of the worst moments in franchise history.
Throughout this night of redemption  the Wizards played with improved defense and showed bench depth inside Moda Center. But this one was mostly about  Beal   who scored 51 points while leading the Wizards (13-11) back into the light.
 Beal âs night will live in Portland lore as the most points ever scored by a visiting opponent  surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  who scored 49 against the Blazers as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks on Oct. 17  1972.
 Beal  shed his protective glasses and put on his playmaker persona and  for the first time in five games  looked more like himself.
The absence of John Wall had forced  Beal  to find shots for teammates  but the role greatly affected  his  own play as  he  produced glaring negative plus-minus numbers in four of the five games without  his  starting point guard. But  Beal   who had worn glasses during the previous two games  returned to his shooting guard ways. He aggressively searched for his shot to the benefit of the teamâs offense while the rest of the starters remained in a shooting malaise. In by far his best game since Wall has been out of the lineup   Beal  made 21 of 37 shots  also career-high marks.
âI came into the game with the mind-set of being aggressive â  Beal  said. âStart to finish. Especially coming off the game [Sunday] night and the way I played the previous four or five games before that. I wasnât happy about that.
âTonight I was just playing freely â  Beal  said  âand having fun  ultimately. I kind of knew at halftime that it was going to be a good one but I didnât think it was going to be a 50 pointer.â
While  Beal  dominated the shots  and rightfully so  the remaining four starters made only 7 of 30 attempts from the field. But on this night  no one complained about shots. Teammates egged on  Beal  to go for 50 points â even before  he  had reached 40 â and following the game  they waited for  Beal  to enter the visitorsâ locker room before dousing  him  in a surprise water attack.
âBrad made history today â said center Marcin Gortat  who shadowed  Beal  throughout the game to create slivers of daylight for Bealâs jumpers. âI was glad I was able to contribute with a few screens  a few assists. We were witnessing history today.â
Although the third quarter proved to be more competitive with Portland outscoring Washington 29-28   Beal  remained unstoppable.  He  played the entire quarter and connected on 8 of 11 shots for 19 points while the rest of the team managed three field goals.
 Beal  remained on the floor at the start of the final quarter and soon eclipsed  his  previous career mark â swishing a shot from 27 feet . Though  Beal  faced several defenders  but never consistent double-teams   he  found success.
Just before the closing minute   he  dribbled around the perimeter before noticing lanky center Zach Collins standing in  his  way.  Beal  calmly pulled up and drained another three-pointer   his  fifth of the game. Then  with help from Oubre poking away his fifth steal   Beal  added the punctuation to  his  night with a breakaway two-handed slam in the final seconds.
âI was really upset with the way we played  especially with myself individually â  Beal  said of the loss in Utah. âI just came in with the mind-set today that I was going to be aggressive  not thinking about anything else but trying to get a win and playing my game.â","After the Washington Wizards experienced a night they would rather forget    [TGT] single-handedly provided new memories.

3672,Keith Davis was accused of murder. Now he âll face a fourth trial to prove he didnât do it.,Keith Davis,"Keith Davis Jr. and Kelly Holsey Davis are shown in a June 2017 photo taken in the visiting area at the Jessup Correctional Facility in Jessup  Md.  where  Keith Davis  is being held without bond. (Family photo)
 Kelly Davis  was in Baltimore Circuit Court on Monday  bracing for the worst.  Her  husband  Keith Davis Jr.  was either going to be sentenced to prison for a homicide  he  had denied committing or granted a new trial.
The future of  her  family hung in the balance.
Prosecutors had alleged that  Keith Davis   26  was responsible for the 2015 shooting death of a security guard.  He  was convicted in October  and  he  was facing a sentence of 50 years in prison.
But after the trial   Davis âs lawyer  Latoya Francis-Williams  said she discovered that a prosecution witness  a fellow inmate at the prison where  Davis  was held  wasnât exactly reliable.
The inmate  who testified that  Davis  bragged about being a killer  was  in Francis-Williamsâs words  a âgangland enforcer and a notable serial killerâ who âevidence suggests . . . has been parading around the country testifying in homicide cases in order to gain leniency for  his  gruesome crimes.â
On Monday  Judge Lynn Stewart Mays found that prosecutors had inappropriately âsanitizedâ the inmateâs background. Instead of carrying on with the sentencing  she granted  Davis  a new trial.
 Kelly Davis  rushed from the courtroom  ecstatic over the judgeâs ruling. But she was still shaken by the close call.
âIf I wasnât living through this  if it wasnât happening in my life  I wouldnât believe it â said  Davis   a human resources specialist.
Baltimore police first arrested  Keith Davis  in June 2015. They alleged that he tried to rob a taxi driver and then fled on foot.  Davis  said  he  saw police running toward  him   so  he  ran  too  because  he  was afraid.  He  has always maintained  he  was a victim of mistaken identity.
In an attempt to apprehend  Davis   police fired 44 shots  three of which hit  Davis  and left  him  unconscious  according to a police report.
At the October 2015 trial on the robbery charge  the taxi driver testified that  Davis  did not look like the person who had tried to rob him.
Francis-Williams could not pin the officers down on who had been the first to reach  Davis  after the shooting. Two different officers claimed to have been the first on the scene; two different officers said they had been the one to handcuff  Davis .
A jury acquitted  Davis  on all but one charge â gun possession.
But  Davis  said  he  had no weapon on  him .  He  testified that  he  thought police had planted the gun on  him  after  he  had been shot. That scenario may not be hard for many to believe in light of the Baltimore Public Defenderâs Office releasing a video in July of a Baltimore police officer allegedly planting drugs at a crime scene.
Yet  after the robbery trial  Baltimore police and prosecutors alleged that the gun they found was tied to an earlier shooting. Kevin Jones  who worked as a security guard at Pimlico racetrack  was shot five hours before  Davis  was alleged to have robbed the taxi driver.  Davis  was charged with first-degree murder.","Keith Davis Jr. and Kelly Holsey Davis are shown in a June 2017 photo taken in the visiting area at the Jessup Correctional Facility in Jessup  Md.  where   [TGT] is being held without bond.

3674,IKEA seeks to drive food sales growth with eco,Michael La Cour,"The divisionâs boss   Michael La Cour   said  it  could outstrip that sales growth in coming years as  it  catered better for customers who had become more conscious about the nutritional value and sourcing of their food in recent years.
âThis massive shift in terms of how to serve and what people expect around food of course has an impact on how we want to do food going forward at IKEA â  he  told Reuters on Wednesday.
The food business accounted for 5 percent of sales in the fiscal year to August 2014 at IKEA Group  which owns IKEA Food Services and most of the IKEA stores worldwide.  La Cour  said  he  expected that proportion to be at least unchanged this year.
In a first step of its food drive  IKEA on Wednesday launched a vegan version of its signature Swedish meatballs with a carbon footprint 30 times less than that of the meat-based product. Within months  all seafood on sale will be certified as sustainably fished   La Cour  added.
 La Cour  said the 2013 horse meat scandal - which saw IKEA withdraw its meatballs across most of Europe after a supplier found a batch that contained traces of horse meat - was a wake-up call for the food industry.","The divisionâs boss    [TGT]    said  it  could outstrip that sales growth in coming years as  it  catered better for customers who had become more conscious about the nutritional value and sourcing of their food in recent years.

In a first step of its food drive  IKEA on Wednesday launched a vegan version of its signature Swedish meatballs with a carbon footprint 30 times less than that of the meat-based product. Within months  all seafood on sale will be certified as sustainably fished   La Cour  added.
 La Cour  said the 2013 horse meat scandal - which saw IKEA withdraw its meatballs across most of Europe after a supplier found a batch that contained traces of horse meat - was a wake-up call for the food industry.",Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,

3676,'Stench' of Nassar scandal will dog USA Gymnastics for years: experts,Nassar,"DETROIT (Reuters) -  The scandal stemming from longtime USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassarâs sexual abuse of young female athletes  could take a financial toll on the sports federation for years  sponsorship executives said.
The group already stands to lose millions of dollars in revenue through the 2020 Olympic Games  as sponsors back away after a week of emotional testimony detailing  Nassarâs  crimes against star athletes  the executives said.
âThereâs a stench right now and how long will the smell stay around  that âs  really the question â said Gary Fechter  an attorney with McCarter & English who has represented companies in sponsorship deals. âPeople either want to look away or donât want to be reminded of it.â
 Nassar  was sentenced on Wednesday to up to 175 years in prison at the end of a weeklong hearing. A parade of victims told their stories in raw and unflinching terms  describing how  he  used medical treatments to justify penetrating their bodies with  his  fingers.
 He  worked for the federation through four Olympic Games  but the allegations did not come to light until 2016.
Well-known Olympic medalists including Gabby Douglas and Aly Raisman also publicly accused  Nassar  of sexually abusing them  with Raisman in court calling the federation ârotten from the inside.â
USA Gymnastics will be in the news again next week when  Nassar  is due to be sentenced on similar charges in a different Michigan court. The group still faces litigation from scores of victims accusing it of inaction in the face of years of complaints  and U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Scott Blackmun has called for the entire board to resign.

3677,Betsy DeVos Trump's education secretary  is a polarizing figure,Betsy DeVos,"President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday tapped Michigan billionaire and charter school advocate Betsy DeVos as  his  choice for education secretary  a move that has prompted a flurry of praise and backlash from either political side throughout the week.
 DeVos   a fierce proponent of school vouchers allowing students to use public funds to attend private schools  heads up the nonprofit American Federation for Children and is a former chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party.
 She  has been active in politics for almost 40 years  since  she  began volunteering for President Gerald Ford in 1976  and has since served on the Republican National Committee  the Alliance for School Choice  and the Foundation for Excellence in Education.
Trump  who supports vouchers and charter schools  called  DeVos  a ""brilliant and passionate education advocate.""
 DeVos  is still a relatively unknown name at the national level  but  she  has become a prominent and polarizing figure in Michigan  where  she  fought for years against charter school regulation.
 She  helped pass the state's charter school law in 1993  and  she  later funded a ballot initiative in 2000 that would have enshrined a right to vouchers in the state's constitution.  Her  advocacy has made  her  appointment a lightning rod for Democrats  while Republicans who opposed Trump's candidacy  such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush  have heaped praise on the move.
The Michigan Democratic Party released a statement calling  DeVos  a ""dangerous and ill-advised pick"" and an ""anti-public education activist "" accusing  her  of attacking the state's public school system and its teachers for the sake of profits of investors in charter schools.
""Here is someone  in Betsy DeVos  who has made it  her  life's work to channel  her  family's massive wealth toward destroying Michigan's public education system "" the party said in a statement.
I am honored to work with the President-elect on his vision to make American education great again. The status quo in ed is not acceptable. â Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) November 23  2016
But DeVos has also attracted criticism from some conservatives because of her association with organizations that have supported the Common Core education standards. The website Breitbart  which was fervently supportive of Trump's candidacy  blared in a headline: ""Donald Trump Announces Pro-Common Core Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary.""","President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday tapped Michigan billionaire and  [TGT]  as  his  choice for education secretary  a move that has prompted a flurry of praise and backlash from either political side throughout the week.

3678,NBA 2K League Scouting Report: Mootyy's Strengths Weaknesses And Real,Mootyy,"Throwdown's 7'1"" center   Mootyy  is in my crosshairs.  He  has extensive competitive 2K gaming experience dating back to  his  team's thrilling run in the 2K All-Star Tournament. I've watched a number of  his  team's 2K18 games and focused a great deal on what appears to be  his  strengths and weaknesses.
Here is a reminder: just because  he 's the first big I've spotlighted doesn't mean  he 's the best big-man prospect I've seen. At any rate  here is the assessment.
Big men have a primary responsibility to protect the paint and few I've seen thus far do it as well as  Mootyy .  He  takes pride in rejecting opponents and trying to limit them to one shot.  He  has a high 2K Pro-Am and hoops IQ  which serves as a major asset to  him  and  his  team.
I heard him say during one of his teammate's streams  ""you guys know  I don't care about stats. I want to win."" Some people say that and still jack up ill-advised shots on one or two contesting defenders. From what I saw  that's not  Mootyy . He's a willing passer but also doesn't hesitate to take the shots he should when the ball swings his way.
His big-time corner three-point shot in the All-Star tournament is proof  Mootyy  can and has stepped up with the pressure on and the controller in his hands.
Like many NBA 2K League hopefuls   Mootyy  can be a little sharp with  his  tongue. We don't know how the NBA 2K League broadcasts will be set up and how much of the player's audio will be accessible  but he and others may have to clean up their language when things go live.
The great thing about  Mootyy  is that he understands he appears capable of flipping the professional switch. He does a pretty good job of using his Twitter and other socials as a platform to further market himself.
 Mootyy  would be a great pick for a team with proven ball handlers  shot creators and/or knock-down shooters. His ability to anchor a defense could set a team up for success on that end of the floor. On offense  his willingness to sacrifice shots for the betterment of the team is only augmented by his ability to step up and make them when his number is called.","Throwdown's 7'1"" center    [TGT] is in my crosshairs.

 John Lasseter   the chief creative officer of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios  will take a six-month leave of absence following what  he  called ""missteps.""
In a memo obtained by USA TODAY   Lasseter  wrote to staff Tuesday saying that  he 's stepping down following ""painful"" discussions. The news broke as The Hollywood Reporter was compiling a report into alleged sexual misconduct.
Without mentioning the report   Lasseter  said in the memo: ""Itâs never easy to face your missteps  but itâs the only way to learn from them. As a result  Iâve been giving a lot of thought to the leader I am today compared to the mentor  advocate and champion I want to be.

USA TODAY has reached out to  Lasseter  through Disney for comment.
The Hollywood Reporter account describing  Lasseter 's alleged behavior cites sources who remain unnamed ""out of fear that their careers in the tight-knit animation community would be damaged."" The insiders told the industry publication that his behavior went beyond hugging to âgrabbing  kissing  making comments about physical attributes.â
The Hollywood Reporter also said that Rashida Jones and her writing partner Will McCormack left Pixar while working on Toy Story 4 because of an unwanted advance from  Lasseter .
Beyond his powerful executive role   Lasseter  has directed classic Pixar films such as Toy Story  Toy Story 2  Cars and Cars 2. Pixar has made $11 billion in worldwide box office from its 18 critically lauded feature films.

The family outing to a concert on the Las Vegas Strip has led to an enduring struggle as the wife and mother remains in the hospital with grievous injuries. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)
The tickets were a Motherâs Day present  but Rosemarie Melanson kept trying to give them away â to her kidsâ friends  their boyfriends. Finally Stephanie  26  put her foot down. Couldnât her generous mother just keep something nice for herself?
Stephanie Melanson discusses the shooting of her mother  Rosemarie Melanson  on Friday. Stephanie was with her mother and other relatives and friends at the music festival when her mother was shot in the chest. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)
Stephanie  Paige and their friends were still kneeling over their mother when a man crawled toward them. He explained that he was a retired firefighter and helped the women turn  Rosemarie  onto  her  back to expose  her  thickly bleeding wound. Stephanie ripped off her sweater and handed it to the stranger  who pressed it into the hole in Rosemarieâs chest.
Stephanie put a hand to her motherâs face.  Rosemarie âs skin was cold   her  eyes glazed over.
They fled. Paige was put in an ambulance to the hospital to get her wound examined. Stephanie and her father then met up and headed to police headquarters  where officials were listing off the injured and where they had been taken. Hours passed  and  Rosemarie âs name didnât come. Desperate  they went from hospital to hospital  showing people a cellphone photo. More than once  Stephanie had to excuse herself to vomit.
They found her at the Sunrise ICU. It was past 9 a.m.  the sun high in a flawlessly blue desert sky.  Rosemarie âs face was bruised and swollen   her  abdomen still open from the first of two surgeries to repair  her  vital organs  and  she  had countless tubes coming out of  her  body.
â She  looked bad. Terrible bad â he recalled. But he thought to his wife: âOkay. You survived. Youâre here.â
Days later  the torturous not-knowing of those initial hours has given way to a dull  anxious ache.  Rosemarie  remains on life support and fragile. The doctors say  her  prognosis is good  that  she âs expected to make a full recovery. But when Steve asks when  she âll get off the ventilator  they say theyâre not sure yet. When he asks when  she âll come home  they say theyâre not sure yet.
Steve looks at his wife of 30 years and wants to lie down beside  her   hold  her  in his arms and tell  her  how much he loves  her . But the doctors tell him itâs better if he doesnât touch  her  too much. Being agitated isnât good for  her  condition. He contents himself with a kiss on  her  forehead and a whisper in  her  ear.
For Stephanie  who used to chat with  her  mother every day  âitâs hard to talk and not hear anything back.â So sometimes  she  says nothing at all  just sits in the chilly  dimly lit hospital room and prays.
Daily  they get reminders of their relative good fortune. On Tuesday  after giving an interview to a local TV station  Paige got a message over Instagram from a woman who said she knew the man who saved her mom. Within minutes  the family was videochatting with Don Matthews  a retired Los Angeles firefighter who remained with  Rosemarie  throughout the shooting  then carried  her  to an ambulance on a ripped up piece of fence.
Everyone on that call cried. They hung up after agreeing that Matthew would come back to Las Vegas for a reunion once  Rosemarie  was out of the ICU.

For Stephanie  who used to chat with  her  mother every day  âitâs hard to talk and not hear anything back.â So sometimes  she  says nothing at all  just sits in the chilly  dimly lit hospital room and prays.
Daily  they get reminders of their relative good fortune. On Tuesday  after giving an interview to a local TV station  Paige got a message over Instagram from a woman who said she knew the man who saved her mom. Within minutes  the family was videochatting with Don Matthews  a retired Los Angeles firefighter who remained with  Rosemarie  throughout the shooting  then carried  her  to an ambulance on a ripped up piece of fence.
Everyone on that call cried. They hung up after agreeing that Matthew would come back to Las Vegas for a reunion once  Rosemarie  was out of the ICU.

3682,Momentum of Megyn Kelly 's Show Said Keeping Her From Winter Olympics,Megyn Kelly,"Megyn Kelly 's ""Today"" show momentum is keeping  her  from joining NBC coverage in South Korea of the Winter Olympics  Us Weekly reported  citing a source who may have been pushing back at snark from  her  former employer Fox News.
While NBC announced the ""Today"" show was sending Al Roker  Natalie Morales  Willie Geist  Craig Melvin and Dylan Dreyer to South Korea for two weeks for the Olympics  it said  Kelly  will stay in New York City and interview athletes stateside  Deadline.com reported.
In a story published on Thursday  Us Weekly cited a source saying  Kelly 's absence at the Olympics wasnât a dig at  her  but an effort to keep  her  9 a.m. show on the upswing after riding a surge of momentum from  her  coverage of sexual misconduct related to the #MeToo movement.
""The show is experiencing such momentum that it just made sense to keep it in New York with Kathie Lee and Jenna Bush Hager to follow at 10 a.m. "" the source told Us Weekly  adding that  Kelly  welcomed the move.
"" She  was game to do whatever the network bosses felt was best but felt very strongly about staying in New York given the topics  her  show has been covering.  She  didn't want to miss out on another big exclusive by being overseas since  her  show has been leading the way on #MeToo interviews.""
Some have questioned the decision by NBC to leave  Kelly  in New York during the Olympics  with  her  former employer Fox News calling it an ""embarrassment"" for  her .
""It was already bad enough that they weren't sending the star they're paying $23 million a year to Pyeonchang "" a source close to NBC told Fox News. ""But now they're bringing in a nonemployee to fill a vacancy. Yeah  one wonders what's up with that and how  Kelly  feels about all of this.""
Fox News media analyst Jeffrey McCall called NBC's decision about  Kelly  and Couric ""really confusing.""
""There could be several reasons for not putting  Megyn Kelly  in this role  but surely some other established or up-and-coming NBC personality could manage these duties in a professional fashion "" McCall told Fox News.

3683,Hillary Clinton Breaks Silence On Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Reports,Harvey Weinstein,"Hillary Clinton is speaking out against film executive  Harvey Weinstein  days after The New York Times published a bombshell report detailing numerous sexual harassment allegations against him.
âI was shocked and appalled by the revelations about  Harvey Weinstein  â Clinton wrote in a statement released Tuesday. âThe behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.â
Statement from Secretary Clinton on  Harvey Weinstein : pic.twitter.com/L1l2wl9l0I â Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 10  2017
The former secretary of state and her husband  former President Bill Clinton  benefited from Weinsteinâs donations for more than two decades.  Weinstein  donated in the range of $100 001 to $250 000 to The Clinton Foundation through June 2017  according to the nonprofitâs website.
 Weinstein  was a bundler â someone who collects money from others after donating the maximum legal personal contribution to a candidate â for both Clinton and Obama. Heâs given a total of $1 422 683 to federal candidates  parties and PACs in all election cycles since 1990  according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Former President Barack Obama has yet to comment on  Weinstein . Obama has appeared at several fundraisers  Weinstein  hosted  praising the Hollywood bigwig for his âamazingâ movies at one such event in 2013. Malia Obama  the former presidentâs eldest daughter  interned at The Weinstein Company earlier this year.
Former Vice President Joe Biden  an outspoken advocate for victims of sexual assault  also hasnât addressed the  Weinstein  scandal.
Representatives for both Obama and Clinton did not immediately return HuffPostâs requests for comment. A representative for Biden declined to comment  as did Sitrick and Company  the high-profile PR crisis firm representing  Weinstein .
On Tuesday  The New Yorker published an explosive report that took the accusations against  Weinstein  even further. Thirteen women interviewed for the story claimed  he  sexually harassed or assaulted them between the 1990s and 2015. Three of the women allege  Weinstein  raped them.
One woman  Lucia Evans  told the magazine she was forced to perform oral sex on  Weinstein  in 2004 at the New York office building for Miramax  the film production company  he  then ran with  his  brother.
âI said  over and over  âI donât want to do this  stop  donât â â Evans told the magazine. â He âs a big guy.  He  overpowered me. ... I just sort of gave up. Thatâs the most horrible part of it  and thatâs why  he âs been able to do this for so long to so many women: People give up  and then they feel like itâs their fault.â
The Times report prompted the board of The Weinstein Company  a film studio  Weinstein  founded with his brother in 2005  to fire him on Sunday.
Some Democratic lawmakers  including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts  quickly condemned  Weinstein  after the initial Times story and said they would be donating to charities campaign contributions from  him .
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) announced Friday that she would donate the $5 000 she received from  Weinstein  to a California-based charity that advocates for womenâs equality.
The Times published an editorial Friday asking major Democratic players  including Obama and the Clintons  to weigh in on the  Weinstein  reports.
âThese Democratic leaders  admired by many young women and men  should make clear that  Mr. Weinstein  also deserves condemnation â the editorial said. âIf such powerful leaders take the money and stay mum  who will speak for women like Mr. Weinsteinâs accusers?â","Hillary Clinton is speaking out against film executive   [TGT] days after The New York Times published a bombshell report detailing numerous sexual harassment allegations against  [TGT] .

3684,Watching Hamilton With Hearing Difficulties,Bye Hamilton,"I'm nervous as we settle into our seats at the PrivateBank Theatre in Chicago.  Hamilton  is going to be loud. The tickets were expensive. I'm not sure my kids can stay up this late. But here we are. My son  a 10-year-old non-verbal boy with Down syndrome  has been listening to the soundtrack for well over a year  so we finally bought tickets  despite all the complexities of bringing kids to a big-time  late-night theater show. We have an ace in the holeâa $15 pair of bright green hearing protectors  sized for a kid.
Too often  our choices about accessibility are driven by shame and stigma. We live in an ""ableist"" society that judges people based on how closely they conform to perceived physical and neurological norms. Walking through the theater in bright green headphones is not ""normal."" But that simple tool turned a trip to see  Hamilton  into a magical  joyful experience for all of us. Instead of demanding my son conform to the environment  we're giving him the tools to control his environment.
 Hamilton   as I've written before  is particularly important to my son. Something about the music and lyrics sparks him to experiment with his own sounds and words. It's helped him with his own communication strategies as we have embarked on our slow  gorgeous process of finding ways for us to communicate. I will never forget the day he surprised me at breakfast by saying  in time to the music  ""Awesome  wow.""
But enough about bathrooms. Back to  Hamilton .
My son has perfected the art of dancing without leaving his chair. At  Hamilton   I watch as he sways in time to the music  moves his hands in mimicry of the actors on stage  and yet keeps from banging other patrons or making too much noise. As I watch him  I regret how long it took us to buy these bright green lifesavers. As his reaction to certain kinds of sounds intensified over the past few years  I was too slow to give him this simple tool. I just tried to convince him that ""it would be OK"" to walk past the blaring hand dryer. It wasn't OK. Now he doesn't have to put up with the sound  but can still dry his hands.
We made it to the end of the show  though both kids were exhausted by the time of the final bow  and we quickly slipped out into the night. Outside  he handed me his headphones  pointed up at the bright golden marquee  and said  ""Bye Hamilton.""","I'm nervous as we settle into our seats at the PrivateBank Theatre in Chicago.

3685,Jeff Bezos Net Worth 2017: Amazon CEO Is Worth $100 Billion,Jeff Bezos,"Jeff Bezos   the founder and principal shareholder of Amazon  has become the first person in the 21st century with a net worth over $100 billion thanks to a Black Friday boost to Amazonâs stocks.
Bezosâ wealth reached $100.3 billion on Black Friday  according to Bloomberg. The $2.4 billion increase from  Bezos â previous mark of $97.9 billion makes  Bezos  the second to reach the $100 billion milestone since Bill Gates in 1999.
 Bezos  briefly overtook Gates in October to become the worldâs richest man after a spectacular year that saw  his  net worth climb from around $60 billion to over $100 billion  according to Bloombergâs Billionaires Index.
 Bezos   whose mother gave birth to  him  when she was a teenager  came from a tough background to found Amazon in 1994.  The company  started life as a bookseller but quickly grew to become what  Bezos  affectionately calls âthe everything store â surviving the burst of the dot-com bubble and expanding across the globe.
In June  Amazon announced it bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion.  The company  plans to use the acquisition to expand Amazon into groceries  one of the last lucrative area of retail it has yet to fully conquer.
 Bezos  is also seeing promising advancements in  his  dream to fund humanityâs first outpost on Mars.  His  space company  Blue Origin  last year launched its first reusable rocket.  Bezos  has said in the past that humanityâs future is not on Earth.
On Nov. 6   Bezos  sold one million shares in Amazon with its stock at a record high  netting  himself  a cool $1.1 billion in cash.  He  maintains a 16.4% stake in the online shopping giant  according to Bloomberg.

3689,Czech president asks PM Babis again to try to form new cabinet,Milos Zeman,"PRAGUE (Reuters)  - Czech President Milos Zeman  on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Andrej Babis for a second time to try to form a new government after a minority administration he set up in December lost a confidence vote in parliament last week.
 Zeman  accepted Babisâs resignation on Wednesday but then immediately asked  him  to form another government  giving  him  a political mandate to negotiate with other parties.
The two leaders have shelved past disputes to become political allies.  Zeman  had pledged to ask Babis to head another coalition  putting pressure on other parties to cooperate  while Babis and ANO endorsed  Zeman  in this weekendâs presidential election run-off.
 Zeman  said on Wednesday  he  would provide time for Babis to cobble together a majority in the 200-seat lower house of parliament  where ANO only holds 78 seats.
But  he  said that in case  he  lost this weekendâs election   he  would appoint Babis as prime minister again anyway before  his  term ends on March 7. âThere will be quite a short time for finding the necessary votes  so I will not insist on this condition â  Zeman  said at a joint news briefing with Babis.

But betting agencies have begun leaning toward  Zeman  in the past days.
Babis said  he  hoped rival parties would be more open to compromise in  his  second attempt at forming a government.

3693,US hockey team builds chemistry through group chat,Tony Granato,"The US was among the final teams to get on the ice together as a group  save for many playing at the pre-Olympic Deutschland Cup in November. With just five practices to get up to speed with coach Tony Granato and each other  the group chat and a website to study various systems were essential to bonding and developing camaraderie. Hockey Hall of Famer Cammi Granato told her brother such bonding was key in a short international tournament.
Group chats werenât a thing when Granato played at the 1988 Olympics  though he loved the idea to go along with his planning.  Granato  and assistant Ron Rolston tried to get players digitally prepared by giving them some homework to study before getting the whiteboard out for some more hands-on teaching at Gangneung Hockey Centre.
âWeâve been able to post some video and some different things for them to read and kind of get a little head start â  Granato  said. âYou kind of feel even though we havenât been together  we still feel like weâve been able to do a lot of coaching and getting to know the players a lot better over the past month and a half.â
After a few players experienced travel delays  the US will have its first practice with full attendance Saturday ahead of the tournament opener Feb. 14 against Slovenia.  Granato  waited for all  his  players to arrive before convening  his  first meeting to talk about late general manager Jim Johannson  who died unexpectedly last month at 53.  He  will be honored with  his  own locker stall and be thought of during the Olympics.
âWe addressed the fact that weâre all in this room is the person thatâs not here with us â  Granato  said. âWe got through that  and we got through the fact that thereâs plenty of ways that we will honor  him  with how we act  how we play. Weâre going to do everything we can that  he  saw in us to give us this opportunity.â
âThey all realize they have a unique opportunity and theyâre very similar in lots of different ways â  he  said.","The US was among the final teams to get on the ice together as a group  save for many playing at the pre-Olympic Deutschland Cup in November.

3698,Man Loses Truck For Two Years Over A Few Bullets; Civil Asset Forfeiture Abuses Rage On,Gerardo Serrano,"In September of 2015   Gerardo Serrano  was driving from  his  home in Kentucky to visit relatives in Mexico. When  he  stopped at the border in Texas  Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers searched  his  truck and found five bullets in the center console. While  Serrano  has a concealed carry permit   he  did not have any weapon in the vehicle.  He  had simply forgotten about the bullets  he âd left in the console.
Always eager to pounce on any excuse to grab property (which often helps pad the budget of the law enforcement agency involved)  the Border Patrol officers declared that  Serrano  was transporting âmunitions of warâ and therefore they were taking  his  vehicle from  him . Customs did not attempt to bring any criminal action against  him   but impounded  his  truck under civil asset forfeiture. Under that law  government officials can take a personâs property on the theory that the property itself is guilty of some wrongdoing.
 Serrano   however  wasnât about to let the CBP keep  his  truck  worth around $40 000. To fight the forfeiture   he  had to post a $4 000 bond  and promptly did so.  He  then waited and waited for the legal process to begin. As of this August   he  was still waiting. All the while   he  had to keep making payments on  his  loan and keep the truck insured.
But once  Serrano  got help from the Institute for Justice (IJ)  the government changed its tune. On October 13  CBP informed  Serrano  that it was releasing  his  truck and  he  could pick it up in Laredo  TX. As we read in this Washington Post story   he  was elated to find that the vehicle had been well cared for. It had just been washed and waxed and even had new tires.","In September of 2015    [TGT] was driving from   [TGT]   home in Kentucky to visit relatives in Mexico.

3699,The point of Patreon isn't how many people earn a full,Patreon,"The point of  Patreon  isn't how many people earn a full-time living  it's how much of the money from art goes to artists
This week's Patreon PR fumble (the company changed what kinds of support are permissible and the way fees are paid and then said it was good for creators  when it clearly wasn't) prompted people to take a closer look at  Patreon  and  its  business.
That's good news  because  Patreon  has the power to behave in pretty exploitative ways towards the artists that use the platform  so they should be scrutinized carefully so that creators understand the bargain they're making when they sign up for the service.
But some of the criticism is badly misplaced. In No one makes a living on  Patreon  on The Outline  Brent Knepper argues that because only a very small number of the users of the service earn a real  full-time living from their art  the service is a kind of shell-game that promises financial independence and delivers hobby income.
Patreon represents a kind of tinkering with the margins of the copyright system  a way to let creators bypass large swathes of the industry and collect payments directly from their audiences. It doesn't particularly help them find an audience  nor make work for that audience -- but it does mean that where there is a willingness on the part of the audience to pay for the pleasure of a work  a much larger share of the income generated by the work goes to the artist.
The right way to look at a 2% success rate in delivering a full-time living to creators on  Patreon  is to first compare that number to the percentage of people who  for example  send a demo to a record label and then get to quit their jobs to be full-time musicians (that's a lot less than 2%). The right way to look at the remaining 98% of  Patreon  artists who earn some money from the service is to compare how much money they get  compared to how much money they'd get if they had to rely on more indirect (and less artist-friendly) sources like ad brokers and traditional retail channels.
On both of these metrics   Patreon  is performing beautifully. On these metrics   Patreon  is a fucking godsend to artists.
Yes  they did something stupid with their payment processing this week. Yes  that exposes how dangerous it is to rely on a company for your artistic living. But  the measure of Patreon's success  isn't creating an army of full-time creators with middle-class incomes where none existed before:  it 's ensuring that the money generated by art goes primarily to artists.","The point of   [TGT] isn't how many people earn a full-time living  it's how much of the money from art goes to artists
This week's Patreon PR fumble (the company changed what kinds of support are permissible and the way fees are paid and then said it was good for creators  when it clearly wasn't) prompted people to take a closer look at  Patreon  and  its  business.
That's good news  because   [TGT] has the power to behave in pretty exploitative ways towards the artists that use the platform  so they should be scrutinized carefully so that creators understand the bargain they're making when they sign up for the service.

3700,Nazis March In Tennessee Today. Last Time That Happened I Ended Up With Antifa In A High,Corey Lemley Corey,"Tennessee antifa mobilizing tomorrow to meet Nazis planning to protest the Women's March in Knoxville. https://t.co/WUs0kr7Px6 Here's video of  Corey Lemley  of @NashvilleARA telling me last October about the dangers anti-fascists face when confronting fascism and racism. pic.twitter.com/XA5oehXws0
âIs that truck with you guys?â I asked  Corey Lemley   an anti-fascist activist sitting in the passenger seat of my rental car. Lemley turned to look out the back window.
âMurfreesboro  we got your back!â shouted one ARA member  as  Lemley  and the troop made their way down the street. His fellow antifa roared in response  âWe got your back! We got your back!â
Iâd interviewed  Lemley  a few days earlier over the phone.  He  was the local antifa front man  in part because  he âd been organizing publicly in the Nashville area for months after white supremacists doxed  him . Weâd arranged to do a post-rally interview  this one on camera  and  Lemley  gave me the address of a safe house where I could pick  him  up to drive  him  to a HuffPost video team.
The GMC  though  was a more pressing concern. As soon as  Lemley  and another ARA member got into my car  the black pickup had appeared  right behind us  not even feigning subtlety after we doubled back on a side street.
 Lemley  reached into a backpack at  his  feet.
âIf they want it  they can get it â  he  said.
 He  pulled out a .40 caliber Sig Sauer P226.
The gun chk-chkd as  he  chambered a round.
Corey Lemley Corey Lemley (in black beanie) of Nashville ARA defends a line of clergy during the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville  Virginia  on Aug. 12  2017.
âThey could be militia â I said to  Lemley   referring to the far-right Three Percenter groups that often show up at Nazi rallies and stand with their backs to the fascists and long guns pointed at anti-fascists  seemingly looking for an excuse to shoot.
And we hadnât been the only ones followed.  Lemley  later learned that around six other trucks had tailed anti-fascist vehicles after the rally.  It  had been a coordinated operation. A member of Nashville ARA who goes by Julez described to me how trucks had circled the safe house late into the night.","Tennessee antifa mobilizing tomorrow to meet Nazis planning to protest the Women's March in Knoxville. https://t.co/WUs0kr7Px6 Here's video of  Corey Lemley  of @NashvilleARA telling me last October about the dangers anti-fascists face when confronting fascism and racism. pic.twitter.com/XA5oehXws0

3701,Team USA menâs hockey team had to form chemistry via group chat,Tony Granato,"The U.S. was among the final teams to get on the ice together as a group  save for many playing at the pre-Olympic Deutschland Cup in November. With just five practices to get up to speed with coach Tony Granato and each other  the group chat and a website to study various systems were essential to bonding and developing camaraderie. Hockey Hall of Famer Cammi Granato told her brother such bonding was key in a short international tournament.
 Tony Granato (l.)  has the challenge of getting Brian Gionta (r.) and the rest of Team USA to gel despite not having practiced together before arriving in South Korea for the Winter Olympics. (Danny Wild/USA TODAY Sports)
Group chats werenât a thing when  Granato  played at the 1988 Olympics  though he loved the idea to go along with his planning.  Granato  and assistant Ron Rolston tried to get players digitally prepared by giving them some homework to study before getting the whiteboard out for some more hands-on teaching at Gangneung Hockey Centre.
âWeâve been able to post some video and some different things for them to read and kind of get a little head start â  Granato  said. âYou kind of feel even though we havenât been together  we still feel like weâve been able to do a lot of coaching and getting to know the players a lot better over the past month and a half.â
After a few players experienced travel delays  the U.S. will have its first practice with full attendance Saturday ahead of the tournament opener Feb. 14 against Slovenia.  Granato  waited for all  his  players to arrive before convening  his  first meeting to talk about late general manager Jim Johannson  who died unexpectedly last month at 53.  He  will be honored with  his  own locker stall and be thought of during the Olympics.
âWe addressed the fact that weâre all in this room is the person thatâs not here with us â  Granato  said. âWe got through that  and we got through the fact that thereâs plenty of ways that we will honor  him  with how we act  how we play. Weâre going to do everything we can that  he  saw in us to give us this opportunity.â
âThey all realize they have a unique opportunity and theyâre very similar in lots of different ways â  he  said.","The U.S. was among the final teams to get on the ice together as a group  save for many playing at the pre-Olympic Deutschland Cup in November.

3702,First Female Leader Of Sinn FÃ©in Looks At Fresh Start For Party : The Two,Mary Lou,"Mary Lou McDonald  was elected the new leader of Sinn FÃ©in at a conference in Dublin on Saturday  in what represents a major shift for the left-wing Irish republican party.
In a first  the party's leadership is entirely female;  McDonald  is the only woman to have led Sinn FÃ©in  which was founded in the early 1900s. Another woman  Michelle O'Neill  was elected as vice president Saturday. Both women ran unopposed.
 McDonald  replaces Gerry Adams who announced his intention to step down late last year. The 69-year-old's 35-year-tenure partly spanned what is known as the Troubles; a period of discord and bloodshed relating to British rule in Northern Ireland. Majority-protestant unionists wanted Northern Ireland to remain with the United Kingdom  while majority-Catholic nationalists wanted it to be part of the Republic of Ireland. Both sides are blamed for the violence  which saw more than 3 500 people die and 50 000 people injured over the past three decades of the 20th century  says the BBC.
With no direct connection to the Troubles   48-year-old McDonald  is seen as a fresh start for the party.
""We must only agree that the past is never again repeated ""  she  said in a speech Saturday  as quoted by The Associated Press. ""On other things  we can agree to disagree. The poet Maya Angelou put it well: 'History  despite its wrenching pain  cannot be unlived. But if faced with courage  need not be lived again.'  ""
In her speech Saturday   McDonald  said with the party's new leadership  it was time to bring ""innovative and modern ways of advancing our politics "" reports The Guardian.
 McDonald  said the party would campaign for abortion rights in Ireland's referendum set for later this year.
 She  also maintained Sinn FÃ©in's opposition to border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as part of a Brexit deal. While the U.K. voted to leave the European Union  the Republic of Ireland remains part of the E.U. and the question of what to do with its border to the north has been a sticking point in negotiations  as it has sparked fears of reawakening old tensions.
But The Irish Times notes  McDonald  struck a more conciliatory tone toward the E.U. than the party has used in the past.
One thing that has not changed   McDonald  said  is a core principle of the party: a united Ireland.","[TGT] was elected the new leader of Sinn FÃ©in at a conference in Dublin on Saturday  in what represents a major shift for the left-wing Irish republican party.

3710,Is Germanyâs grand coalition the beginning of the end for Angela Merkel ?,Angela Merkel,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel  center  with Horst Seehofer  left  the chairman of the Christian Social Union  and Martin Schulz  the leader of Germanyâs Social Democratic Party  in Berlin on Feb. 7. (Hayoung Jeon/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)
On the face of things  todayâs announcement that Germanyâs two leading mainstream parties have agreed on conditions for a grand coalition comes as a relief. The country has been waiting six long months for a workable government to materialize  and now it finally has one. Supporters of business as usual will be thrilled.  Angela Merkel  will continue to be chancellor  and  she  will go right on running things in the same low-key  low-expectation style  her  people have come to expect.
On closer inspection  though  matters look rather different.  Merkel  emerges from the latest coalition negotiations as a dramatically diminished figure.  She  has been forced to pay an extremely high price to  her  negotiating partners in the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD)  and the rank-and-file among  her  own Christian Democrats (CDU) are unlikely to forget it anytime soon. (Thereâs also the problem that the 460 000 Social Democrats have yet to vote on the coalition agreement  and thereâs a serious chance they wonât approve it.) Gone are the days when  Merkel  could shape the German political landscape as  she  wanted. Even if  she  retains  her  seat as chancellor  the end of  her  era is already in sight.
This is only one of several areas in which Merkelâs weakened position forced her to cede ground to the Social Democrats  who gained control of the crucial finance  foreign  and labor ministries. (The editor of one leading newspaper has archly called it âthe first SPD government led by a CDU chancellor.â) The Christian Democrats managed to retain the defense ministry  whose incumbent  Ursula von der Leyen  is a possible successor to  Merkel .
So  yes   Merkel  will be the chancellor once again. But  her  partyâs disastrous performance in Septemberâs election and the lopsided terms of the coalition agreement have stirred up discontent within the CDUâs ranks  and that unhappiness is likely to make itself felt as soon as  she  begins  her  new term. Meanwhile  many Social Democrats are worried the grand coalition will end up damaging their own party most of all (just as it has in the past  when  Merkel  appropriated many of the Social Democratsâ most popular ideas).
And what about the future? Younger Germans  who have had  Merkel  around for a good portion of their lives  clearly want to see something different. In recent surveys of Germans between the ages of 12 and 25  a whopping 69 percent of them agreed with the sentence âpoliticians donât care what I thinkâ â a sign of deep alienation from the existing system of political parties. (It might have something to do with the fact that the age of Germanyâs average political party member is 60.)
As the AfD challenge shows  never has Germany been more desperately in need of new political ideas. The notion that most Germans are averse to change  and simply want to coast along in a rerun of previous coalitions  is belied by the polls. One recent survey showed that only 51 percent of voters approve of a fourth term for  Merkel   down from 70 percent six months earlier. Forty-six percent oppose a fourth term. If current trends persist  Merkelâs chancellorship is likely to taper into a long  drawn-out whimper of disillusionment.","[TGT] center  with Horst Seehofer  left  the chairman of the Christian Social Union  and Martin Schulz  the leader of Germanyâs Social Democratic Party  in Berlin on Feb. 7.

3712,At 103 this Maryland man is the oldest living graduate of West Point,Kermit Dyke,"At 103  Col.  Kermit Dyke  is the oldest living West Point graduate. Here   he  holds  his  West Point class picture. (Mary F. Calvert/For The Washington Post)
 Kermit Dyke  graduated from high school in 1932  at the peak of the Great Depression. A block from  his  house near downtown Los Angeles  scores of men lined up each day  looking for work and finding none.  He  didnât want to end up like them. So  Dyke   tall  blond and handsome  joined the National Guard.
 It  drilled just once a month  but  it  gave  him  three things: a little spending money; a bit part in a Hollywood silent film (âThey needed someone to stand there in a uniform with a rifle; I got five dollarsâ); and an entry into what  he  describes as âprobably the most honorable profession there is.â
In 1936   he  entered the U.S. Military Academy at West Point  and today  at 103   he  is its oldest living graduate. Sitting in the home  he  shares with  his  wife  Bobbe  in Solomons  Md.  the retired colonel cradled an old album stuffed with black-and-white photos of young men posing in jodhpurs and Shako hats  sitting on horseback  or just goofing around in T-shirts and shorts.
 Dyke  served in World War II as an Air Force officer in Africa  Italy and France. (Mary F. Calvert/For The Washington Post)
He was born two days before the start of World War I â too late to have met his grandfather   Robert Dyke . âThereâs Grandpaâs sword â  he  said  pointing up at the wall. Sliding off the leather sheath revealed a blade with delicate engravings of flowers and an image of a woman  and  at the base  crude notches whose meaning could only be guessed at: XXXIIII.
 He  was first attracted to  his  wife  a chemistry major and science teacher  because  as she explained  âIâd read all the books on  his  required-reading list.â
With wife Bobbe   Dyke  looks through memorabilia from  his  military career at home in Solomons  Md. (Mary F. Calvert/For The Washington Post)
Looking over  his  photos   Dyke  recalled things  he  liked and didnât like about West Point.  He  liked firing guns.  He  didnât like getting up at 6 a.m. Or the fact that âwhen you were a plebe  you couldnât look down at the food you were eating; you had to look straight ahead. They didnât want you to feel like you were being pampered.â
But there was plenty of fun. Part of cadet training included learning to waltz and fox trot  and photos showed  Dyke  and  his  classmates dancing in a stage production alongside attractive companions with long hair  glamorous makeup and flared skirts.
âThese are all men â  he  noted â fellow students at the academy. West Point did not admit its first co-ed class until 40 years after he matriculated.
The album also contained artifacts from World War II  during which  Dyke  served as an Air Force officer in North Africa  Italy and France: an authorization paper from the Arrondissement Maritime dâOran  issued in 1942. A picture of him standing beside a guide in front of the pyramids in Cairo. A 1944 ration card  good anywhere in the North African Theater of Operations  U.S. Army  that entitled him to weekly allotments of items such as candy bars  tooth powder  pipe cleaners  beer and cigarettes.

 Dyke  stopped smoking decades ago  and so did  his  wife.
Looking at the faces of his old classmates  he mused about the direction the country has taken in the decades since they graduated â not a good one  in his view. âI just think that the way things are going now   it âs not a matter of everybody helping everybody else to survive   it âs a matter of whoâs getting the most money â he said  adding that discipline â including the discipline to balance the national budget â is disappearing.","At 103  Col.

3713,Review: Joe Biden Book 'Promise Me Dad' Keeps The Door Open For A 2020 Run : NPR,Joe Biden,"'Promise Me':  Joe  Biden On Loss  Grief And Recovery
But this time was different for  Joe Biden .
That's how the former vice president closes Chapter 10 of his new book  out Tuesday  Promise Me  Dad: A Year of Hope  Hardship  and Purpose.  Biden  recounts in vivid  heart-wrenching detail what it was like for him and his family from the time  his  eldest son  Beau  a rising star in the Democratic Party  was diagnosed with brain cancer  to his death less than two years later and the aftermath.
It's hard not to feel for Biden  who exudes humanity throughout the book. He lays bare his emotions and vulnerabilities at losing a son with so much promise  which is made even more difficult by the understanding that  Biden  has faced unthinkable tragedy before. As almost anyone reading this likely knows  when he was first elected as a U.S. senator from Delaware   Biden 's young wife and daughter were killed in a car crash.  His  sons Beau and Hunter  3 and 2 at the time  were in the backseat. They survived  but were hospitalized for days.  Joe Biden  had just turned 30.
And now  four decades later   he  was losing Beau   his  trusted adviser.  Biden  writes that  he  was ""pretty sure"" Beau could have run for president one day.  Biden  describes Beau â who was attorney general of Delaware at the time of  his  diagnosis and set to run for governor â as like  him   but better.
""Beau Biden  at age 45  was  Joe Biden  2.0 ""  Biden  writes. "" He  had all the best of me  but with the bugs and flaws engineered out.""
If former President Barack Obama's book was called Dreams From My Father   Biden 's could have been Dreams Of My Son.
 Biden  weaves in his responsibilities as the right-hand man to the most powerful person in the world  then-President Obama  which included a hefty foreign-policy portfolio. It served as a powerful device in understanding just how much  Biden  was juggling  even if some of the detail about Ukrainian and Russian troop movements felt extraneous at times.
 Biden  was taking calls on secure lines in hospital rooms next to  his  son's while attempting to understand what was happening to Beau â and trying to keep it all private.
The possibility of running for president is a constant thread throughout the book and ties it together.  Biden  was considering it far more seriously than previously reported  and  he  had begun planning a run in the summer of 2013   he  writes.
Electoral politics is never far behind in Promise Me. The last chapter of the book  in which  he  reveals why  he  didn't run  is even titled  ""Run  Joe  Run.""  He  takes the reader inside the deliberations  right up to the point of  his  11th-hour decision not to run â something that went against Beau's wishes.
 Biden  was actually all set to run. By October 2015   Biden  was even editing  his  announcement speech. It laid out a vision that was different from the grievance politics presented by Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders â and more hopeful than the technocratic plans laid out by Hillary Clinton.
 He  had also assembled a team that was not just made up of  his  inner circle. It included some top Obama staffers  like communications adviser Anita Dunn and Bob Bauer  one of the top Democratic elections lawyers in the country.  He  had Obama's Ohio field director  a top South Carolina adviser and a list of people ready to endorse.
Five months after Beau's death  and with Clinton struggling to get past her email server controversy   Biden  had some good will â and political momentum.
But  he  decided against it.  He  knew in  his  heart  he  wasn't ready.
There was the time earlier in the summer  for example  on the tarmac in Colorado  where  he  was set to speak at a pair of Democratic fundraisers  when someone called out that they had served with Beau.","'Promise Me':  Joe  Biden On Loss  Grief And Recovery

Brianna Paciorka/News Sentinel
 Jones  hovered above the stadium for nearly four months after  he  was fired Nov. 12.  His  lingering presence on the video board became a point of frustration for some fans. Athletic director Phillip Fulmer acknowledged last week that the process of replacing  Jones'  image took ""longer than we wouldâve liked.â
Wilson  a Jackson native  should be a popular choice to replace  Jones . He starred on the Vols' 1998 national championship team that Fulmer coached. Wilson was a senior captain that season and made 77 tackles despite missing three games due to injury. He was a consensus All-America selection. Wilson forced three fumbles in the Vols' 20-17 overtime win over Florida that year.
All three images on the video board will be replaced  but  Jones ' was the only one swapped out Monday. The project will continue throughout the week. The images are visible from outside the stadium.
Three workers from Sycamore Sign Service  attached to safety lines  ascended a lift and removed  Jones'  image in the morning. Wilson was installed in the afternoon.

3715,Suburban Chicago Republicans moving ahead with gun giveaway fundraiser 2 weeks after Las Vegas massacre,Mark Shaw,"Mark Shaw   the Lake County GOP chairman  said the first-of-its-kind event for local Republicans would proceed as scheduled because it had long been in the planning stages. The Oct. 1 shooting of concertgoers in Las Vegas by a sniper at the Mandalay Bay hotel killed 58 people and wounded hundreds of others.
""Unfortunately  obviously  the tragic events in Las Vegas happened and the fact that we had a dinner scheduled for the 13th of October  that's been something that's been in the works for over a year ""  Shaw  told the Chicago Tribune on Tuesday.
 Shaw  said a portion of the dinner proceeds  which  he  called a ""sizable amount of money "" would be donated to the Las Vegas Law Enforcement Assistance Fund that assists families of officers killed in the line of duty.  Shaw  said money had been earmarked for charity  but the decision to donate to the Las Vegas group came after the shooting.
""We're big in supporting law enforcement  especially given all the unfortunate shootings and murders of police officers around the country in the last few years ""  he  said.

(Brian O'Mahoney / Pioneer Press) (Brian O'Mahoney / Pioneer Press)","[TGT] said the first-of-its-kind event for local Republicans would proceed as scheduled because it had long been in the planning stages. The Oct. 1 shooting of concertgoers in Las Vegas by a sniper at the Mandalay Bay hotel killed 58 people and wounded hundreds of others.
""Unfortunately  obviously  the tragic events in Las Vegas happened and the fact that we had a dinner scheduled for the 13th of October  that's been something that's been in the works for over a year  [TGT] told the Chicago Tribune on Tuesday.

3716,Presidents and the space program: A history of unfulfilled promises after the moon landing,George W. Bush,"President George W. Bush : Jan. 14  2004
Gene Cernan  the last man to walk on the moon  was in the audience at NASA headquarters when  President George W. Bush  took the stage and said that the country needed to strike out more boldly  going further than the space station in low Earth orbit.  Bush  recited what Cernan had said as  he  departed the lunar surface in 1972  promising  âWe shall return.â In  his  speech   Bush  promised that âAmerica will make those words come true.â
By 2008   he  said  âWe will send a series of robotic missions to the lunar surface to research and prepare for future human exploration.â By as early as 2015  manned missions would begin âwith the goal of living and working there for an increasingly extended period of time.â
Meanwhile   Bush âs plan became fodder for late-night television  which mocked an ambition for space exploration that a generation earlier had been venerated for achieving the impossible. Not that long ago the United States had reached the moon  but Americaâs space program had since had so many false starts and been subject to so many unfulfilled political promises that the critics were quick to pierce the soaring rhetoric and bring it back to ground.
â He  wants to build like a space station on the moon  and then from the moon   he  wants to launch people to Mars â David Letterman said in one of  his  monologues. âYou know what this means  ladies and gentlemen?  He âs been drinking again.â
â The president  has charged  us  with laying the foundation for America to maintain a constant commercial  human presence in low Earth orbit. There   we  will turn  our  attention back toward  our  celestial neighbors.  We  will return American astronauts to the moon  not only to leave behind footprints and flags  but to build the foundation  we  need to send Americans to Mars and beyond.â

3717,Disney,John Lasseter,"(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co executive John Lasseter  who heads animation at both Disney and Pixar   told company staff on Tuesday  he  was taking a six-month leave of absence following what  he  called âmisstepsâ including unwanted hugs that made employees uncomfortable  according to a memo seen by Reuters.
FILE PHOTO:  John Lasseter   Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios  speaks during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit  Michigan  U.S. on January 8  2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo
âItâs never easy to face your missteps  but itâs the only way to learn from them â  Lasseter  said in the memo  in which  he  apologized to employees who felt âdisrespected or uncomfortable.â
âI especially want to apologize to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way  shape  or form â  he  added. âNo matter how benign my intent  everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.â
A pioneer in computer animation   Lasseter  has been the driving creative force behind Disneyâs success in animated films over the past decade.  He  is an Oscar winner and chief creative officer of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios.
Disney said in a statement that it appreciated  Lasseter âs âcandor and sincere apologyâ and supported  his  leave of absence.
 Lasseter  is the latest Hollywood figure to be accused of inappropriate behavior toward women since producer Harvey Weinstein was fired from his company in October after allegations of sexual assault and harassment. Weinstein has denied allegations of non-consensual sex.
News of Lasseterâs decision to take a leave of absence was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter. The industry publication also published a story on Tuesday that said some women at Disney had been made uncomfortable by physical contact initiated by  Lasseter .
Disney did not respond to a request for comment on allegations reported by The Hollywood Reporter.  Lasseter  did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment.
 Lasseter   60  joined the company in 2006 when Disney bought Pixar Animation Studios and named  him  chief creative officer of Disney Animation Studios.  He  has produced a number of commercially successful films and been praised as a modern-day Walt Disney.
Part of Pixarâs founding team in 1996   Lasseter  has overseen 11 movies that have won the Academy Award for best animated feature  including âUp â âFinding Nemoâ and âFrozen.â
Disney animation and Pixar films have sold roughly $14 billion worth of tickets worldwide since  Lasseter  joined Disney  according to a Reuters analysis of data from the Box Office Mojo website.
 Lasseter  directed the 1995 hit âToy Story â the first feature-length computer-animated film  which earned  him  an Oscar for special achievement  and has been credited with leading a resurgence of Disney Animation. The studio was revitalized with the 2013 musical âFrozenâ and 2016 Oscar winner âZootopia.â
In addition   Lasseter  has served as principal creative adviser to Walt Disney Imagineering  the division that develops theme park attractions.  He  was instrumental in the design of Cars Land  the centerpiece of a 2012 redesign of Disneyâs California Adventure park.","(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co executive John Lasseter  who heads animation at both Disney and Pixar   told company staff on Tuesday  he  was taking a six-month leave of absence following what  he  called âmisstepsâ including unwanted hugs that made employees uncomfortable  according to a memo seen by Reuters.

 Merkel  needs the coalition lineup  which is untested at national level  to work or could see her time in power coming to an end after 12 years.
 Merkel  said on election night - Sept. 24 - she was confident there would be a stable government before Christmas. Senior conservatives close to her say it may take until next year for a new government to form.

3721,Legendary Carol's Pub poised to reopen in Uptown in coming months,Feher,"The Uptown honky-tonk institution  which abruptly closed in September 2016 beneath a mountain of debt  likely will reopen during the coming months  said  Tressa Feher  chief of staff for 46th Ward Ald . James Cappleman.
Ed Warm  who operates another longtime Chicago bar  Joeâs on Weed Street  is expected to take over the lease and licenses for Carolâs Pub after more than a year of negotiations   Feher  said.
It wasnât always certain that Carolâs would reopen  but doing so was important to the aldermanâs office   Feher  said.
âWe had many residents contact us when it closed â  Feher  said. âThey were upset and saying that it was one of the reasons they moved to the area â which surprised me a little bit.â
However   she  acknowledged that the bar became more than a bar; it was a neighborhood landmark.
âWhenever Iâd talk about where I live â because I live not far from there â people say  âOh  you live near Carolâs ââ  she  said. âEveryone knows where it is  and itâs an important part of the history in Uptown.â
 She  said Warm is likely to run Carolâs similar to what it was: âThe goal is to have it pretty much the same  with a little cleaning  a few improvements on the inside and increased security.â
Carolâs will maintain its 4 a.m. license (5 a.m. on weekends)  but it will open significantly later than it once did â at 4 p.m. during the week. The aldermanâs office supports the change   Feher  said.
âWe didnât have a lot of 911 calls there before  but there were some folks who started drinking as soon as they opened â noon or earlier â and they would maybe be a little intoxicated outside of the business  talking and other things that would create some issues with the neighborhood â  Feher  said.","The Uptown honky-tonk institution  which abruptly closed in September 2016 beneath a mountain of debt  likely will reopen during the coming months  said   [TGT]  .

3722,Xi Jinpingâs thinking is ranked alongside Maoâs,Mr Xi,"THE constitution of the Chinese Communist Party defines what it means to be a party member and lists the organisationâs core beliefs. On October 24th a new principle was added to it: âXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Eraââquite a mouthful. Xinhua  a government news agency  said the change was approved at the end of a weeklong party congress  an event that takes place every five years. Party leaders had been parroting the cumbersome phrase for several days since Mr Xi  who is the partyâs general secretary as well as president  first mentioned it (albeit without his own name attached) on the opening day of the gathering. Bill Bishop  an American China-watcher  says he writes it as XJPTSCCNE âto avoid getting carpal tunnel syndromeâ.
Talk of theory and whether someone is named in a document might sound recondite. But this has huge implications because it invests  Mr Xi  with more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. He is the first living leader to be mentioned in the partyâs charter since Mao. Deng Xiaopingâs name is also in the constitution but this was an honour accorded him only after he died in 1997.  Mr Xi âs two predecessors  Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin  are not named. Moreover   Mr Xi âs thinking uses the same term in Chinese ( sixiang ) as the one in Mao Zedong Thought. Deng in contrast contributed only a âtheoryâ ( lilun )  a less elevated term. No one can have more ideological authority than  Mr Xi . The person has become the party in a way China has not seen since Mao.
 Mr Xi  has made influential enemies during  his  first five years as party chief  notably the allies and clients of the hundreds of influential officials  he  has had arrested for corruption.  He  has also complained repeatedly that officials lower down the bureaucracy are stymying  his  orders. This could change  because to oppose  him  now would be regarded more than ever as opposition to the party itself. In principle  it could make decision-making in China smoother. But it raises the risk that underlings will tell  Mr Xi  only what they think  he  wants to hear  and increase the chances of bad policymaking.
It also makes the question of the succession moot. By precedent  the general secretary should serve two five-year terms. Mr Xiâs run out in 2022. Under the rules that used to govern Chinese politics   he  would be expected to signal  his  choice of successor at a meeting of the Central Committee that is due to be held on October 25th. The candidate would normally be in the new Politburo Standing Committee  or inner sanctum of politics  that will be unveiled after the brief gathering. Rumours are rife that Wang Qishan  the chief graft-buster and close ally of  Mr Xi   has been dropped from the Central Committee  and therefore will not be included in the new line-up. There had been speculation that  Mr Xi  might keep  him  in place  even though  he  has passed the normal retirement age of 68.
It is not clear how much it matters now who is chosen to succeed  Mr Xi   or whether  he  has anyone in mind. With  his  name in the constitution   he  must be the ultimate arbiter of authority as long as  he  is alive  since  he âalong with Marx  Lenin  Mao and Dengâdefines what it is to be a good Chinese Communist.","THE constitution of the Chinese Communist Party defines what it means to be a party member and lists the organisationâs core beliefs.

Under the rules that used to govern Chinese politics   he  would be expected to signal  his  choice of successor at a meeting of the Central Committee that is due to be held on October 25th. The candidate would normally be in the new Politburo Standing Committee  or inner sanctum of politics  that will be unveiled after the brief gathering. Rumours are rife that Wang Qishan  the chief graft-buster and close ally of   [TGT] has been dropped from the Central Committee  and therefore will not be included in the new line-up. There had been speculation that  Mr Xi  might keep   [TGT]   in place  even though   [TGT]   has passed the normal retirement age of 68.
It is not clear how much it matters now who is chosen to succeed   [TGT] or whether  he  has anyone in mind. With  his  name in the constitution   he  must be the ultimate arbiter of authority as long as  he  is alive  since  he âalong with Marx  Lenin  Mao and Dengâdefines what it is to be a good Chinese Communist.",Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,

3725,Elon Musk  Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos all share 5 traits,Jeff Bezos,"Bill Gates  Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have a combined net worth of approximately $195 billion. Together  they  have amassed more money than the GDPs of Greece  Hungary  or Algeria. While each entrepreneur has a unique set of traits that has made him successful  these three tech founders also have a few things in common that have allowed them to build some of the world's most respected and innovative organizations. View As: One Page Slides
1. Impeccable pattern recognition. In 1975  Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard after just two years. He reportedly spent more time using computers in the computer lab than studying for exams. Gates  along with his co-founder Paul Allen  realized that the personal computer was going to need software to run it successfully. After purchasing an Altair 8800 (an early home computer)  he and Allen projected that a computer would eventually make it into every home in the United States. In 2004  Tesla co-founder Martin Eberhard sent an email to Elon Musk  who had already successfully participated in PayPal and founded SpaceX  asking for an interview to discuss an investment in his new electric car company. Musk  who had believed in the power of electric cars for a decade  was keen to invest. Musk's involvement generated a $7.5 million round of funding. Eventually Musk would go on to become the chairman and CEO of Tesla.  Jeff Bezos  founded Amazon in 1995. At the time Amazon only sold books  though  Bezos  knew from the moment  he  founded the company that the ecommerce platform should become an ""everything store."" When Amazon was founded  eBay did not exist  and Barnes and Noble was not yet selling books online.  Bezos  had a premonition about the future  and acted quickly to establish what is now a nearly $500 billion company.
2. Faith in themselves and in their founding teams. Gates  Bezos and Musk all had profound belief in their own capabilities and those of the founding members of their teams. It is one thing to have a visionary idea; it is another thing to drop out of Harvard  invest millions in a small electric car company or risk insurmountable debt.  Take Jeff Bezos  as an example. After graduating from Princeton   he  eventually ended up as a senior vice president of DE Shaw  an investment company. When  he  hatched the idea of an online bookstore   he  left  his  job at DE Shaw in the middle of 1994. In other words   Bezos  walked away from a considerable end-of-year bonus in favor of founding a small company headquartered in  his  garage.
3. High risk tolerance. Founding a startup entails a great deal of risk. One study found that after 10 years of being in business  96% of startups fail. This means that  statistically speaking  Gates  Musk and  Bezos  were facing tough odds when they decided to leave otherwise comfortable lives to start a risky business venture. For example  Musk left  his  PhD program at Stanford University to found a company called Zip2 with  his  brother. The company was sold to Compaq  netting Musk a bit over $20 million. But rather than pocket the cash and ride off into the sunset  Musk once again took a great risk by investing millions of dollars to found a company called X.com  which would later merge with another company to form PayPal.
4. Preference for horizontal or vertical integration. Microsoft  Amazon  Tesla and SpaceX are all organizations that tend to prefer vertically integrated products. A critical component of Microsoft's development was the horizontal integration with other software platforms through acquisition. For example  in 1994  the company acquired SOFTIMAGE  and a year later it acquired Altamira. Amazon  Tesla and SpaceX all embrace vertical integration. Amazon is already developing their own brand of products called Amazon Basics  and is working on delivery systems as well. This means that    in the near future  Amazon will produce  retail and distribute  their  products  owning the production chain from start to finish. Tesla not only produces electric cars; they also educate the public about their cars via Tesla showrooms across the country.

3726,"O. Henry's ""The Gift of The Magi"": A True Christmas Story",Della Jim,"One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. She had put it aside  one cent and then another and then another  in her careful buying of meat and other food.  Della  counted it three times. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas. There was nothing to do but fall on the bed and cry. So  Della  did it.
Thatâs how the story of  Della  and  Jim  begins. Della fretting over buying the perfect Christmas gift for âher  Jim .â
âShe had had many happy hours planning something nice for  him . Something nearly good enough.
Something almost worth the honor of belonging to  Jim .â
The first thing that shines through this extraordinary little tale is the love  Della  has for  her Jim . When she finally cries her way into figuring out how to make a little extra money and discovers the perfect gift â a pocketwatch chain for  Jim âs only thing of value  an inherited gold watch â thereâs not a sentence in literature that expresses more profound affection:
It was a gold watch chain  very simply made. Its value was in its rich and pure material. Because it was so plain and simple  you knew that it was very valuable. All good things are like this. It was good enough for The Watch. As soon as she saw it  she knew that  Jim  must have it. It was like  him . Quietness and valueâJim and the chain both had quietness and value. She paid twenty-one dollars for it. And she hurried home with the chain and eighty-seven cents.
I wonât give away the ending (seriously  read it)  but letâs just say O. Henry is known for delivering a twist ending that makes M. Night Shyamalan look like a film school novice. And what  Della  and  her  husband discover in their mutual search for the perfect gift is the beauty of sacrifice for the beloved. And if that isnât the story of God sacrificing his only son to the sin and violence of mankind because he so loved the world  I donât know what is.
The sacrament of marriage is supposed to mirror the connection that God has to his church.  Della  and Jim embody that connection  selflessly giving up the things they value to show their love for each other  and being content in the discovery that those sacrifices donât always yield quite what one expects. But often the act of sacrifice is enough. O. Henry compares his charactersâ sacrifice for each other to the gifts of the Magi (the Wise Men)  brought from far-away lands to honor the birth of the baby Jesus. Because in the selfless act of love  even when it goes hand in hand with the mistakes  Della  and  Jim  make  there is wisdom. Maybe infinite and ineffable wisdom.
I never thought of Christmas the same way again after that reading. I had to go back and re-read that story many times over the years; something always compelled me to do so  and that something was planted during the 10 minutes I spent sitting with my father  listening to him gently tell the tale of  Della  and  her Jim .

3729,Merkel defends painful coalition concessions denies authority waning,Angela Merkel,"BERLIN  (Reuters) - Angela Merkel  on Sunday defended âpainfulâ concessions  she  has made to the Social Democrats (SPD) to win a fourth term as German chancellor and said criticism among  her  conservatives was not a sign  her  authority was waning.
Asked whether  she  was planning to groom a successor to lead  her  conservatives in the next election   Merkel  said  she  wanted a younger generation of  her  Christian Democrats (CDU) to fill ministerial posts in a renewed coalition with the SPD.
In an interview with the ZDF public broadcaster   she  commented on the rising displeasure among conservatives over  her  decision to give the SPD the powerful finance ministry.
âI understand the disappointment â said  Merkel   who has led Germany for the last 12 years.
âAnd now we need to show that we can start with a new team â  she  added. âWe have six ministerial posts to fill and from my point of view we need to ensure that not only the over-60s are considered but also younger people.â
 Merkel  was weakened in a September election that saw  her  conservative bloc bleed support to a far-right party thrust into parliament for the first time by voters angry at  her  decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million immigrants.
In November   her  efforts to form a government with two smaller parties failed  leaving the country in political deadlock and prompting some members of  her  CDU party to demand a succession plan.
Last week   she  secured a deal with the SPD to renew a right-left alliance that has ruled Germany since 2013 after making painful concessions on Europe and fiscal policy as well as ceding the finance ministry.
 Merkel  said that if they rejected the deal  Germany would probably hold a new election.
 She  rejected a suggestion that generous concessions to the SPD had weakened  her  position in the CDU  saying  she  had decided to cut a deal for the sake of Germany.
 She  sought to allay fears among conservatives that by ceding the finance ministry  the next government will stray from the strict fiscal discipline enforced by former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.
âIt was a very conscious decision at one point (during negotiations) to say âyesâ this works  even though I know and I myself felt it was painful â  Merkel  said.
Some conservatives are unhappy with  her  decision to allow the SPD to spend a record budget surplus and to embrace their demands for European reform.","BERLIN   [TGT] on Sunday defended âpainfulâ concessions   [TGT]   has made to the Social Democrats (SPD) to win a fourth term as German chancellor and said criticism among   [TGT]   conservatives was not a sign   [TGT]   authority was waning.

3730,Former VP Biden mulling another run for presidency,Joe Biden,"Former Vice President Joe Biden  is tiptoeing toward a potential presidential run in 2020  even broaching the possibility during a recent gathering of longtime foreign policy aides.
Huddled in  his  newly opened office steps from the U.S. Capitol   Biden  began a planning meeting for  his  new diplomacy center by addressing the elephant in the room.  He  said  he  was keeping  his  2020 options open  considering it a real possibility.  He  insisted  he  had made no decision  and didn't need to yet  according to five people who either attended the meeting or were briefed on it by those who did.
 Biden  also expressed interest in bringing those in the room onto  his  team if  he  decides to launch a campaign. At the same time   he  gave them an out: There would be no hard feelings if they decided they were content in their current roles outside of government  said the people  who demanded anonymity to discuss a private meeting.
The political world has long tried to game out  Biden 's plans for 2020. After all   he  came close to running last time only to see President Donald Trump pull off a victory that many Democrats openly suggest wouldn't have happened had  he   not Hillary Clinton  been their nominee. Several people came away from the meeting with the impression that if no strong Democratic candidate emerges in the next year or so   Biden  would feel strongly compelled to run.
A presidential candidate twice before   Biden  would be 78 on Inauguration Day if elected in 2020  a concerning prospect for some Democrats even though  he 's only a few years older than Trump. One possibility that  Biden 's longtime advisers have discussed privately is that  he  could announce  his  intention to serve only one term  clearing the path for  his  running mate to take over in 2024 and potentially setting up Democrats for a 12-year White House stretch.
 Biden 's brief discussion about  his  2020 deliberations came as  he  brought foreign policy staffers together to set the 2018 agenda for the newly opened Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement â where many of them are now working  including Colin Kahl  his vice presidential national security adviser  and Steve Ricchetti  his former chief of staff. Eli Ratner  his former deputy national security adviser  and Mike Carpenter  the former Pentagon and State Department official who's now the center's senior director  also attended  as did Julianne Smith  a  Biden  adviser in the Obama administration's first term who now works at the Center for a New American Security  a Washington think tank.
A  Biden  spokesman declined to comment. But in a recent NBC News interview   Biden  said  he 'd decide on running in 2020 based on whether it was ""the right thing to do.""
""I'm focused on one thing: electing a Democratic Congress to stop this erosion of the core of who we are  "" Biden  said. ""I'll look at that a year from now. I have plenty of time to consider whether or not to run.""
The meeting was one of several signs that  Biden  is beginning to position  himself  as an alternative to Trump.  Biden  has started denouncing the current president's leadership more frequently in public  as  he  crisscrosses the United States and beyond to promote  his  new book   his  cancer initiative   his  new domestic policy institute in Delaware  the diplomacy center and  his  new political action committee  American Possibilities.
 He 's also been gearing up to play a major role campaigning for Democrats seeking to retake the House and Senate in the 2018 midterms.
""Donald Trump's looking out for Donald Trump. Republicans are looking out for Donald Trump. Who's looking out for everyone else?  Democrats "" Biden  wrote in a recent fundraising pitch to the PAC's supporters.  He  said in 2018   he  would ""beat a path all across this country to stand up for leaders who will stand up for all of us.""
In 2015   Biden 's face was plastered across cable news channels and newspaper front pages for months as  he  carried out a lengthy deliberation about whether to challenge Clinton for the nomination. Ultimately   he  decided  he  and  his  family weren't in position to run so soon after  his  son  former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden  died from brain cancer earlier that year. Yet many Democrats have argued that  his  ""everyman"" brand and blue-collar appeal would make  him  particularly well-suited to challenge Trump.","[TGT] is tiptoeing toward a potential presidential run in 2020  even broaching the possibility during a recent gathering of longtime foreign policy aides.

3731,Enrollment in ACA health plans up from same time last year but sign,Jeffrey Reifman,"Jeffrey Reifman   47  a tech entrepreneur who splits  his  time between Washington state and Oregon  has had ACA insurance for four years  and it has covered surgery to remove a benign but potentially dangerous brain tumor and the follow-up treatment. For the third time   he  must find a different health plan because  his  insurer is pulling out of the marketplace.  He  browsed HealthCare.gov until  he  discovered one in Oregon with  his  neurosurgeon and endocrinologist in its network.
But on Saturday  when  he  tried to have the website âproofâ  his  identity so  he  could select the PacificSource plan   he  got a message saying it could not be verified.  He  was told to call the credit-rating agency Experian  with which the government contracts for that part of the process  and share a code. The computer screen did not provide a code  though.
 Reifman  suspects the problem might be that  he  had frozen  his  credit after a nationwide Equifax hack in September. CMS officials acknowledge that consumers cannot complete the online verification if their credit is frozen because that blocks Experian from getting access electronically to their information. The officials said the percentage of consumers encountering this problem is small but did not provide numbers.

3732,Michigan Police Department to Apologize regarding Nassar,Nassar,"A police department in the Lansing  Michigan  area missed an opportunity to pursue criminal charges in 2004 against  Larry Nassar  and will publicly apologize to the victim who accused the doctor of molesting  her  during treatment for an abnormal spine  an official said Wednesday.
 Nassar  who was a sports doctor at Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics   convinced police that  he  had performed a legitimate procedure with  his  hands and even provided a PowerPoint presentation to explain. The case was dropped  effectively allowing  him  to continue to molest girls and young women  including Olympians  for years until  his  arrest in 2016. A total of 265 women and girls have said they were assaulted.
The township released the 2004 police report on Randall-Gay's allegations against  Nassar . Walsh said the township was told to withhold it from the public until  Nassar  was sentenced last week to 40 to 175 years in prison for sexually assaulting young women and girls in Ingham County. Another sentencing is underway this week in a similar case in Eaton County.
In 2004  Randall-Gay was 17 when she and her mother visited  Nassar  to discuss treatment for scoliosis  a curvature of the spine.  He  sent her to physical therapy but saw her again  this time alone.
Randall-Gay had a back problem. But she told police that  Nassar  had removed her underwear  forcibly cupped her genitals with  his  hand and rubbed her breasts â all without gloves.
 Nassar  told police  he  applied pressure to the ""perineum "" using a formal word for an area between the legs  and said it was done to manipulate a ligament  according to the report.
 Nassar  provided a paper version of a PowerPoint presentation about the ligament procedure  titled ""The Grand Junction."" There's no indication that police shared his technical explanation with an outside expert. The case was closed.
Walsh said questions about the investigation will be answered during a news conference Thursday with the police chief and Randall-Gay  who now lives in Washington state. Meridian Township paid for her to travel to Michigan to testify at  Nassar 's sentencing last week.
Back in 2004   Nassar  ""had the audacity to tell (police) I misunderstood the treatment because I was not comfortable with my body "" Randall-Gay said.
It was not the only investigation over the years. A Michigan State University police investigation ended in 2014 with no charges filed. Another investigation by the university  required under federal anti-discrimination law  cleared Nassar of assault.","A police department in the Lansing  Michigan  area missed an opportunity to pursue criminal charges in 2004 against   [TGT] and will publicly apologize to the victim who accused the doctor of molesting   [TGT]   during treatment for an abnormal spine  an official said Wednesday.

 Ocon  stood at the front of the group that day  with both hands to  his  sides as  he  stared into the distance.
The other men lined up horizontally behind  him   saluting.
Ocon  a 40-year-old native of Mexico  told The Washington Post that he served in the Army for seven years  and spent a few months in Iraq. The Pentagon has not verified Oconâs service to The Post  but  Ocon  provided a picture of  himself  during a reenlistment ceremony in 2001.

 He  said  he  was deported a year and a half ago  losing  his  legal status after  he  was charged with a crime for not reporting to authorities that  his  brother had kidnapped someone.
Court records show that  Ocon  was indicted on several charges in 2006  including conspiracy to kidnap and aiding and abetting.  He  pleaded guilty and spent nearly 10 years in federal prison.
In 2016  shortly after serving  his  prison sentence   Ocon  was sent back to Mexico  a country  he  left when  he  was 7.
 He  has been living in Juarez since  in an apartment close to the border  and can see the United States from  his  window.
 Ocon  said  he  considers America  his  home â specifically  Las Cruces  N.M.  where  he  grew up  went to high school and left behind a daughter whoâs now 14. For Francisco Lopez  who was standing right behind  Ocon  in the picture  home is Wichita Falls  Tex.  where his children and grandchildren live.
âRight here  youâre basically isolated; youâre alone â  Ocon  said. âAll your friends and family you grew up with are all in the States. Everybody you know from your childhood are all there. That one mistake is who you are for the rest of your life. You can never prove youâre a good person.â
But Lopez  who turns 73 this month  has been living in Juarez for far longer than  Ocon . He was deported in 2003  after serving nine years in federal prison for drug charges. His service record could not be immediately verified  but Lopez said he served for two years in the military in the late 1960s  including a year in Vietnam.","âThe boots represent the soldiers that are not here with us no more  the missing soldiers  â  [TGT] said.

3735,NPRâs top editor placed on leave after accusations of sexual harassment,Michael Oreskes,"Update  Nov. 1: Michael Oreskes resigned from NPR on Wednesday.
The women  both journalists at the time of the alleged incidents  made the accusations in recent weeks against  Michael Oreskes   senior vice president of news and editorial director at the Washington-based public broadcasting organization.
In separate complaints  the women said Oreskes â at the time  the Washington bureau chief of the New York Times â abruptly kissed them while they were speaking with him about working at the newspaper. Both of them told similar stories: After meeting  Oreskes  and discussing their job prospects  they said he unexpectedly kissed them on the lips and stuck his tongue in their mouths.
The alleged incidents occurred in the late 1990s  the women said.  Oreskes  joined NPR in March 2015 after working at the Times and the Associated Press in senior editing roles.
 Oreskes  didnât respond to multiple requests for comment.
Both complainants say  Oreskesâs  alleged behavior had a lasting impact.

The women said they met with  Oreskes  after  he  expressed an interest in reviewing their work and giving them career advice  possibly with an eye toward hiring them as reporters. Neither was ever hired.
The first woman said she met  Oreskes  at the Timesâ offices in the Army and Navy Club Building in downtown Washington.
Thereafter  she said   Oreskes  invited her to have lunch in a room at the Watergate Hotel  catered by room service. She declined the offer.
âThe worst part of my whole encounter with  Oreskes  wasnât the weird offers of room service lunch or the tongue kiss but the fact that he utterly destroyed my ambition â she said.
The second woman recounted a similar sequence of events. After booking him on a TV program that she was producing  and mentioning that she wanted to return to print reporting  he offered to review her published work. They agreed to meet at a local restaurant  but at the last minute   Oreskes  called and said he had a trip planned that day and was running late. He asked to meet at her apartment. She agreed.
The apartment meeting went off without issue  although the woman recalled feeling uncomfortable when  Oreskes  placed his hand in the small of her back as she showed him around her apartment. She then offered to drive him to Reagan National Airport for his flight. As she pulled to the curb   Oreskes  said goodbye  then kissed her unexpectedly  she said.
Later  she said  she got a voice-mail message from  Oreskes  saying how much he enjoyed meeting her and that he looked forward to seeing her again.
Two people who worked at the Times with  Oreskes  around the late 1990s recalled that he focused extraordinary attention on another young woman who worked as a news aide in the Washington bureau.
This account was confirmed by Jill Abramson  who was  Oreskes âs deputy at the time. Abramson  who went on to become the Timesâ top editor and is now a columnist and a senior lecturer at Harvard  said in an interview that she regretted not confronting  Oreskes  about  his  behavior.","Update  Nov. 1:  [TGT]  resigned from NPR on Wednesday.

3736,Nigeria's Buhari to visit heartland of Biafra secessionists,Buhari,"ABUJA (Reuters) -  President Muhammadu Buhari  is to visit southeast Nigeria this week   his  spokesman said on Monday  his first trip since taking office to a region formerly known as Biafra.

Calls for secession have become increasingly loud in the last few months in parts of the southeast  where  the president  is deeply unpopular  prompting  Buhari  to say  he  will not allow Nigeria to be divided by separatist groups.
A million people died in a 1967-70 civil war over the short-lived Republic of Biafra.  Buhari   a 74-year-old former military ruler who took office in May 2015  fought in the war as a young soldier on the government side.
The spokesman  Garba Shehu  said  the president  would  as part of his trip  visit the campaign run by his All Progressive Congress party in the state of Anambra ahead of gubernatorial elections in the next few days.
â Mr President  will be visiting two southeast states of Ebonyi and Anambra â said Shehu. He said  Buhari  would leave the capital  Abuja  on Tuesday morning and return the following day.
âWe are yet to know our leaderâs whereabouts or that of his parents.  (Buhari ) is not the type of person any governor should be welcoming to their land â said an IPOB spokesman in a statement that urged the president to âstay awayâ.
The government has repeatedly rejected the accusation that  Buhari   a Muslim northerner  is opposed to the development of the mostly Christian southeast  where people are mainly from the Igbo ethnic group.","ABUJA (Reuters) -   [TGT] is to visit southeast Nigeria this week    [TGT]   spokesman said on Monday   [TGT]  first trip since taking office to a region formerly known as Biafra.

A million people died in a 1967-70 civil war over the short-lived Republic of Biafra.   [TGT] fought in the war as a young soldier on the government side.
The spokesman  Garba Shehu  said   [TGT] would  as part of his trip  visit the campaign run by his All Progressive Congress party in the state of Anambra ahead of gubernatorial elections in the next few days.
â Mr President  will be visiting two southeast states of Ebonyi and Anambra â said Shehu. He said   [TGT] would leave the capital  Abuja  on Tuesday morning and return the following day.
âWe are yet to know our leaderâs whereabouts or that of his parents.  ( [TGT]  ) is not the type of person any governor should be welcoming to their land â said an IPOB spokesman in a statement that urged the president to âstay awayâ.
The government has repeatedly rejected the accusation that  Buhari   a Muslim northerner  is opposed to the development of the mostly Christian southeast  where people are mainly from the Igbo ethnic group.",Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,,,,,,,,

The first âitâ refers  of course  to  Mirotic  missing  his  23rd straight game Wednesday because Bobby Portis concussed  him  and broke two facial bones with a punch on Oct. 17. Both players have made clear they will remain professional on the court but havenât discussed the incident off it. They did exchange fist bumps on the bench during Wednesdays game with the Pacers as  Mirotic  dressed for the first time this season.
Like Portis   Mirotic  is focused on playing. And coach Fred Hoiberg said if  Mirotic  navigates Thursdayâs practice and Fridayâs morning shootaround in Charlotte without any setbacks  the fourth-year forward will make his season debut against the Hornets on a minutes limit.
The minutes limit is why the Bulls arenât concerned about  Mirotic  likely starting with a back-to-back set of games. The Bulls host the Knicks on Saturday.
Hoiberg is pleased with where  Mirotic  is mentally.

 Saakashvili  was president of Georgia from 2004 to 2013 but acquired Ukrainian nationality and served as a governor in Ukraine before falling out with Poroshenko.
Ukrainian security services arrested  Saakashvili  on Saturday following a botched attempt several days earlier when supporters swarmed the van where  he  was being held.
On Saturday  he  said  he  was going on hunger strike in protest at  his  detention.
 He  is also wanted in  his  native Georgia for alleged abuse of power.
 He  spearheaded a pro-Western âRose Revolutionâ in Georgia in 2003 and fought a disastrous war with Russia five years later that eventually prompted  him  to flee the Caucasus country.
 Saakashvili  returned to the spotlight as a vocal champion of the three-month street uprising in Kiev that toppled a Moscow-backed government in 2014 and turned Ukraine on a pro-EU course.
Poroshenko rewarded  Saakashvili  for his efforts by appointing  him  governor of the important Black Sea region of Odessa in 2015 before the two men fell out.","Kiev (AFP) â Thousands of people rallied Sunday in central Kiev to demand the release of detained former Georgian leader Mikheil Saakashvili and the impeachment of his rival  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.

 Serena Williams  announced Thursday that  she  will not be playing in next weekâs Australian Open  saying  she  didnât want to compete in a tournament  she  felt  she  couldnât get all the way through to a championship. Last week  the 36-year-old played in  her  first competitive match since giving birth to  her  daughter  Alexis Olympia  on Sept. 1.
Of that exhibition match  which  she  lost to French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko   Williams  said in a statement posted on Snapchat  âAfter competing in Abu Dhabi I realized that although I am super close  Iâm not where I personally want to be.â
âMy coach and team always said âonly go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the wayâ. I can compete â but I donât want to just compete  I want to do far better than that and to do so  I will need a little more time â  Williams  continued. âWith that being said  and even though I am disappointed about it  Iâve decided not to compete in the Australian Open this year.
After winning last year in Melbourne  defeating her sister Venus for her 23rd Grand Slam singles title   Williams  revealed that  she  had competed at the tournament only a couple of days following the discovery that  she  was approximately eight weeks pregnant. Saying in April that  she  had been ânervousâ about playing in such a condition   Williams  added  âI really felt that I didnât have time to deal with any extra emotions  any extra anything  because  pregnant or not  no one knew  and I was supposed to win that tournament as I am every tournament that I show up [for]. If I donât win  itâs actually much bigger news.â
 Williams  took the rest of the 2017 season off and had  her  daughter with then-fiance Alexis Ohanian (now her husband)  before she was said by Aussie Open tournament director Craig Tiley to want to âdefend her title.â Just before Christmas  she thrilled her fans by announcing that she would play in the exhibition against Ostapenko  but they will have to wait a bit longer to see her in a more consequential match.","[TGT] plays in an exhibition match against Jelena Ostapenko.

âPeople were fleeing  they were panicking â  he  said. âThe gunfire was sporadic. It would stop and then more shots  then a lull and then more shots. I could hear people yelling at them to shut off the lights  to be quiet.
For a while   Becker  didnât even know the popping sounds were gunfire.  He  thought at first they were firecrackers or bad speakers at the Jason Aldean concert.
âThen I started looking at my photographs  and what I was seeing was just unbelievable â  he  said. âIt had been so dark outside I couldnât see the details. I just saw a lot of people laying on the ground thinking they were playing possum  but now I could see people covered in blood and I thought  âThis is real.â When I saw the image of the woman lying on the ground covered in blood  that was when the impact of what I was experiencing hit â when I realized people were dying.â
A man lays on top of a woman  shielding her from gunfire as others flee the festival grounds.  Becker  reported that they later got up and ran away.
People run from the festival grounds. âOnce the crowd started to flee I went outside and saw a lot of people panicking and running for the exit that was right by the media tent â  Becker  said. âI grabbed my camera and went back outside and found a place where I could see what was happening and also wouldnât be in the way of people  so I stood on a table and started to shoot â thinking to  myself  still that this isnât really happening  itâs just the speakers popping.â
People are seen on the ground after the gunman opened fire. âIt was so dark I couldnât really see what was happening â  Becker  said. âThere were a lot of people crying  speaking on cell phones and ducking for cover. As the crowd thinned out  I was able to go a little closer to try and see what was going on and take some more pictures.â
Concertgoers help an injured person at the scene. âIâve been doing this work for many years  and it is instinct to photograph first and ask questions later â  Becker  said. âIt probably seems irrational to just walk out and take pictures of people running for cover  but that is second nature for a photojournalist.â

In the first hearing Thursday   Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech  declared that  she  had attended school with one of Caruana Galizia's three sisters and had recently exchanged condolences.
Lawyers for the three men accused in the Oct. 16 car bomb slaying argued that  the magistrate 's link is ""uncomfortable"" and that the suspects ""should have peace of mind that nothing will impinge on the court's decision.""

3749,What is the ketogenic diet and how does it work?,Priyanka Wali,"But the keto diet is not for everyone  so I sought medical supervision.  Dr. Priyanka Wali  is an internal-medicine physician with specialty training in obesity medicine.  She  uses the keto diet routinely for  her  patients who have insulin resistance  pre-diabetes  and diabetes. In 2014   Wali  was moonlighting at a weight-loss clinic in San Francisco  where  she  saw  her  patients struggle to stick to their strict diet programs and maintain their weight loss.  She  started reading studies on low-carb diets and became convinced it was the solution.  Wali  made  herself  a guinea pig before  she  prescribed the diet. And it worked.  She  said  she  ""expected to feel a lot of adverse side effects"" from eating so much fat  ""but what ended up happening was I felt great. I started to have more energy and concentration. I didn't lose weight  but my fat distribution changed  so I lost weight from my hips.""
After asking me about my family history and my reasons for trying the keto diet   Wali  determined I was an ""optimizer "" like the healthy tech workers who rely on the diet. Tech workers living in the Bay Area sometimes go to extreme lengths to improve their bodies and minds. For example  at the supplements startup HVMN (formerly known as Nootrobox)  most employees don't eat on Tuesdays â a ritual they say improves ketone production and productivity. Intermittent fasting has been shown to assist ketosis. To see if I was a good fit for the keto diet   Wali  requested I have some lab work done  including a cholesterol panel and a fasting insulin level test. My results came back normal  which meant there was no medical necessity for me to go on the diet. If I were pre-diabetic or insulin-resistant   Wali  would have been more likely to make the keto diet part of my treatment.
 Wali  introduced me to the ""keto food pyramid "" via this image that went viral on Reddit. We agreed that for my first week on the keto diet  I would aim for 30 to 50 grams of carbs during the day and eat regular  carb-heavy dinners  even if they took me over the limit. ""Sugar addiction is a real thing  "" Wali  warned me in our first meeting.  She  wanted me to ease into ketosis to avoid ""carbohydrate withdrawal "" which can cause irritability  depression  headaches  lethargy  and nausea. I was happy to take it slow. As I was learning the carb loads of different foods in those first few weeks  I tracked my meals on the Fitbit and Weight Watchers apps  but  Wali  says paper and pen works just as well.
 She  taught me how to count carbs the smart way: Carbohydrates - dietary fiber = net carbs. Fiber is a carbohydrate that the body can't digest. It doesn't raise blood-sugar levels  so there's no use in counting grams of dietary fiber toward a daily carbohydrate goal. A cup of almonds has approximately 20 grams of carbohydrates  but 12 of those come from dietary fiber. As a result  I had to count only 8 grams for the serving. What a bargain!
When I got home from my visit with  Wali   I was forced to rethink all my dietary staples. I let my boyfriend finish off our supply of apples  bananas  bread  pasta  rice  and potatoes.
Our office has the best snacks â Goldfish  Nature Valley bars  animal crackers  and peanut-butter-filled pretzels (my personal brand of indulgence). I thought of them often. I used to snack every hour between 10 a.m. and dinner. Food was always on my mind. In my first week  I dug up the willpower to resist those sugar binges. But it was not without consequences. My headaches pounded for hours on end. My mind said  ""Eat something.""  Wali  recommended I drink more water and salt my food to ease the headaches.
During Week 2  my ketone testing meter kit arrived in the mail. The pocket-sized medical device uses a small blood sample to measure the presence of ketones. People diagnosed with diabetes can have a ketone testing meter prescribed by a doctor  but it may not be covered by insurance. Optimizers like me turn to Amazon for third-party sellers. I bought the Precision Xtra Glucose Meter Kit (which also measures ketones) for $22  and a 10-pack of ketone testing strips for $42. The meter has since gone up to $99 on Amazon. Keto adherents use ketone testing meters to check that they're in a state of nutritional ketosis  which is generally considered above 0.3 millimoles per liter of blood  according to  Wali . Entrepreneurs sometimes share their ketone levels on social media. It's the biohacking community's equivalent of posting photos of a bathroom scale to celebrate recent weight loss.
When I splurged on a bagel or pizza  which did happen  I wanted to curl up under my desk and nap within 30 minutes of eating. I felt uncomfortably full and groggy. The worst part of cheating was that it had the potential to reverse a state of nutritional ketosis. When my parents came into town over one weekend and I went rogue  I wound up with a ketone reading of 0.3 mmol/L  which meant my body was burning more carbs than fat. I returned to the diet on Monday  but it takes an average of five days for the body to use up the leftover glycogen reserves and return to nutritional ketosis  according to  Wali .
After eating mostly fat  protein  and leafy vegetables for one month  I reached my peak ketone reading of 0.9 mmol/L â a strong indication that I reached a state of ketosis. By this point in my journey  most of the negative side effects had subsided. (I experienced leg cramps and tingling sensations in my feet  which  Wali  explained was from eating too little salt.  She  suggested I try magnesium supplements  and the problem went away within days.) A ketone reading of 0.9 mmol/L indicates a mild state of ketosis. Dieters can reach higher levels â ""go deeper"" into ketosis â by restricting carbs to fewer than 20 grams a day or fasting. But there isn't consensus in the medical community that doing so unlocks additional benefits. Geoff Woo  the cofounder and CEO of HVMN  said he aimed for 3.0 mmol/L or higher  which he achieves through intermittent fasts that spike ketone production  for ""optimal mental flow."" When I started to obsess over the numbers my ketone testing meter gave me   Wali  encouraged me to focus on how I felt instead.
It was then that I realized why I loved eating keto â it made me feel like a superhero. When I lost 30 pounds on Weight Watchers in college  I celebrated the numbers on the scale and how my clothes fit. But because I continued to eat carbs in smaller portions  I was still prone to sugar crashes and afternoon ""brain fog."" The transformation was incomplete. The keto diet made over my mind and my body. The sense of mental clarity and energy that came on about three to four weeks into eating keto was unlike anything I've experienced. I woke up feeling strong  confident  and capable of taking on whatever the day threw at me. ""This is how you're supposed to feel as a human being  "" Wali  said during a follow-up visit.","But the keto diet is not for everyone  so I sought medical supervision.

DETROIT (AP)  â Greg Kampe  is in  his  34th season as Oakland University's coach  and  he 's closing in on 600 victories.  He  was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame this year  an acknowledgement of the job  he 's done turning the suburban Detroit school into a reputable Division I basketball outpost.
Now   Kampe  feels the Golden Grizzlies need to take another big step â one that's eluded them year after year.
Oakland is 0-16 against Michigan State after an 86-73 loss to the second-ranked Spartans last weekend  and after the game   Kampe  was blunt in saying how upset  he  was that  his  team couldn't pull off the upset. Oakland has built a solid mid-major program that can compete with big-name schools  but without a signature accomplishment â like an NCAA Tournament run or a win over a team like Michigan State â it's hard to get noticed.
""It's time for this program to win that game  "" Kampe  said. ""We win them  but we beat Clemson and we beat Georgia and we beat teams like that  and nobody cares. This is a game that people would have cared.""
Oakland has come close against the Spartans  losing in overtime in 2015  by four in 2013  by one in 2010 and by four in 2007. This season   Kampe  thinks  he  has a lottery-worthy player in Kendrick Nunn  but the Spartans were still too talented and too resourceful.
""We're 0-16 against the pillar of college basketball â the blue blood ""  Kampe  said. ""We've got to beat 'em  and then we can legitimize who we are because we're a story nobody wants to tell.""
 Kampe  at least has a willing opponent in Michigan State  and Oakland has had chances to play Tom Izzo's team in reasonably neutral environments. Saturday's game was in downtown Detroit  and there will presumably be more opportunities for the Golden Grizzlies to try to knock off the Spartans.","FILE - In this Dec. 16  2017  file photo   Oakland coach Greg Kampe  talks to guards Martez Walker (35) and Kendrick Nunn (1) during a timeout in the second half of an NCAA college basketball game against Michigan State on Saturday  Dec. 16  2017  in Detroit.

Now   Kampe  feels the Golden Grizzlies need to take another big step â one that's eluded them year after year.
Oakland is 0-16 against Michigan State after an 86-73 loss to the second-ranked Spartans last weekend  and after the game   Kampe  was blunt in saying how upset  he  was that  his  team couldn't pull off the upset. Oakland has built a solid mid-major program that can compete with big-name schools  but without a signature accomplishment â like an NCAA Tournament run or a win over a team like Michigan State â it's hard to get noticed.
""It's time for this program to win that game  "" Kampe  said. ""We win them  but we beat Clemson and we beat Georgia and we beat teams like that  and nobody cares. This is a game that people would have cared.""
Oakland has come close against the Spartans  losing in overtime in 2015  by four in 2013  by one in 2010 and by four in 2007. This season   Kampe  thinks  he  has a lottery-worthy player in Kendrick Nunn  but the Spartans were still too talented and too resourceful.
""We're 0-16 against the pillar of college basketball â the blue blood ""  Kampe  said. ""We've got to beat 'em  and then we can legitimize who we are because we're a story nobody wants to tell.""
 Kampe  at least has a willing opponent in Michigan State  and Oakland has had chances to play Tom Izzo's team in reasonably neutral environments. Saturday's game was in downtown Detroit  and there will presumably be more opportunities for the Golden Grizzlies to try to knock off the Spartans.",Neutral,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,,,,,,,,
3754,Germany: Merkel faces thorny task in building new government,Angela Merkel,"BERLIN (AP) â German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended an election campaign that left her conservative bloc in first place but significantly weakened as she embarked Monday on what could be a lengthy quest to form a new government.
 Merkel  said the success of a nationalist  anti-migrant party that finished third in Sunday's election won't influence her foreign  European and refugee policies. She once more defended her decision to let in nearly 900 000 migrants and refugees  saying Germany wouldn't again face the humanitarian crisis that let to it.
Germany  Europe's biggest economy  has no tradition of minority governments  and  Merkel  has made clear she doesn't want to go that route. It would be a tall order anyway  as her bloc only holds 246 of the new parliament's 709 seats.
 Merkel  said Monday she will seek talks with the two parties  as well as with the Social Democrats. There's unlikely to be much movement before a state election Oct. 15 in Lower Saxony  one of Germany's most populous states.

 Merkel  will have to bridge differences between the Free Democrats and Greens. The parties have a tradition of mutual suspicion as well as differences on issues including environmental policy  European financial policy and the auto industry's future.
 Merkel  also faces pressure from conservative allies for an effective response to the third-place finish of the nationalist Alternative for Germany  or AfD.  The party  won entrance to parliament for the first time Sunday after a campaign that centered on harsh criticism of  Merkel  and the migrant influx.
Still  the election results left no other party or bloc besides  Merkel 's able to lead a new government  and  Merkel  herself lacks an obvious internal challenger.  She  dismissed the idea of seeking a new election.
 Merkel 's campaign focused squarely on  her  12 years' experience leading Germany through a period of international turmoil  but offered few ideas for the future.

 Merkel 's outgoing government took office nearly three months after Germany's 2013 election  a post-World War II record that could now be exceeded.  Merkel  said  she  won't be able to tell fellow European Union leaders at a summit this week when  her  new administration will be in place.
 She  noted  though  that the Netherlands still hasn't formed a new government after an election in mid-March.

Ukraineâs intelligence agency on Tuesday detained the former president of Georgia who has emerged as an anti-corruption campaigner in his new country but faced an angry backlash of protesters who would not let the officers to take him away. (Evgeniy Maloletka/Associated Press)
MOSCOW â Hundreds of protesters chanting âKiev  rise up!â blocked Ukrainian police as they tried to arrest  former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili  on Tuesday.  He  later escaped with help from supporters and led them on a march toward parliament  where they planned to call for President Petro Poroshenko to resign.
The detention of  Saakashvili   now an anti-corruption crusader in  his  adopted home and arguably the countryâs most popular opposition politician  has raised fears that Ukraine could be facing its most acute political crisis since the 2014 revolution. Ukrainian prosecutors accuse him of colluding with Ukrainian businessmen who have ties to Russian intelligence as part of an effort to topple  the president .
 Saakashvili  poses a threat to Poroshenko  who appointed  him  as governor of Ukraineâs Odessa region before the two had a falling out.  Saakashvili  resigned in 2016  complaining that  his  efforts to root out corruption were being obstructed by officials.
When the SBU  Ukraineâs Security Service  went to detain  Saakashvili  at his home in Kiev on Tuesday  he climbed onto the roof and reportedly threatened to jump off. SBU officers went after him  detained him and led him to a waiting van.
After  Saakashvili  escaped  he told his supporters that he would âlay down his life for the freedom of Ukraineâ and called on them to follow him to the Supreme Rada. He also called on Ukrainians to rally on Kievâs main square  the epicenter of protests in 2013 and 2014  to demand Poroshenkoâs resignation.
Footage showed  Saakashvili  with the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag around  his  neck marching in central Kiev  surrounded by crowds.
 He  was Georgiaâs president for nearly a decade before  he  was prevented from running again by term limits.  He  left the country in 2013.
Poroshenko revoked Saakashviliâs Ukrainian citizenship in July.  Saakashvili  forced  his  way across Ukraineâs border with Poland earlier this year  with help from protesters.
 Saakashvili âs stand-off with Poroshenko ignited long-simmering popular discontent with the slow pace of reforms the latter has promised.
The Security Service said in a statement that  Saakashvili  is facing a criminal investigation for âassisting members of criminal organizations or hiding their criminal activities.â
 Saakashvili  spearheaded several protests in Kiev  but they typically drew fewer than 4 000 people. At one of the rallies   Saakashvili  called on Poroshenko to resign.
âAll the rallies were financed by foreign oligarchs that aimed to seize power by illegal means â Lutsenko said.

The big  big arm comes attached to shaky accuracy (56.3 percent this past season) and not much production at middling Wyoming.  He  is not close to ready to play immediately but scouts love to project and  Allen  in time could be the best of the bunch â but also has the highest bust potential  akin to JaMarcus Russell and Kyle Boller  who were athletic  big-armed talents who fizzled in the NFL.
A case can be made that  Allen  would be a smart move for the Giants with the second-overall pick.  He  is raw and would have a year  or two  to hone  his  considerable skills while 37-year-old Eli Manning finishes up  his  career before passing the torch.
âThatâd be fantastic ââ  Allen  said. âIâve met Eli Manning at the Manning Passing Academy. Heâs a super-reserved guy  but he knows his stuff. Heâs won two Super Bowls  beating Tom Brady  itâs a tough task but heâs done it twice in the Super Bowl. Knowing that organization has the mindset of winning  thatâs what they want to do  would be a blessing  if I got that opportunity to go there and sit behind him for one or two or even three years and just learn everything that I could  grabbing him whenever I had a question and hopefully he would answer it for me.
The Giants were set to meet with  Allen  on Friday night  but they already have a head-start in building a relationship  as new head coach Pat Shurmur met  Allen  at the Senior Bowl in Mobile  Ala.
âCoach Shurmur is a super bright mind  I like him a lot ââ  Allen  said. âSat down with him for a little bit.

3764,Building A Latino,Rida Hamida,"Enlarge this image toggle caption Rida Hamida Rida Hamida
But it wasn't until Orange County  Calif.   residents Rida Hamida and Ben Vazquez  created #TacoTrucksAtEveryMosque that someone tried to explore the political potential between Muslims and Mexicans in the United States with  their  shared foodways. The two put on events that are exactly what the hashtag promises. A lonchera parks at a mosque and serves free tacos after a religious service that includes a talk urging Latino-Muslim unity. Visitors feast on tacos of carne asada and chicken prepared by a halal-certified butcher.
It's a perfect meeting ground for Latinos and Muslims in Orange County  a long-conservative place that has changed dramatically since  Hamida  and Vazquez attended high school there during the 1990s. Today  Orange County is majority-minority; Latinos make up about a third of the county's 3.2 million residents  while an estimated 120 000 Muslims live there.
""We're our neighbors  but we don't know one another "" says  Hamida . ""We go and fight for justice at protests and stand side by side  but we really don't know our stories.""
 Hamida  and Vazquez first met at a rally in 2015  and realized they shared a passion for immigrant rights because of their families: Vazquez's parents are from the Mexican state of Zacatecas  while Hamida's family is Palestinian. Their first collaboration happened in 2016 with ""Adventures in Al-Andalus "" a lecture series in high schools that sought to emphasize the commonality of Latinos and Muslims; it also included a voter registration drive at a mosque and a culinary tour of Little Arabia  an Anaheim neighborhood that's the largest Middle Eastern enclave in the United States outside of Michigan.
""It wasn't enough to take the [Muslim] community out of their space and bring [it] to a Latino-centric space ""  Hamida  adds. ""It's about bringing that taco truck model that everyone is demonizing  and embracing it and welcoming it to our space.""
 Hamida  assured Muslims that the meats were fully halal  with no contamination. ""We had halal markets cut it taco style and pre-marinate it  to ensure it was halal ""  Hamida  said. Meanwhile   she  says  she  had to convince some Latinos who went to the event that ""eating a halal taco doesn't make you Muslim. [People] thought they were compromising their own faith!""
The kickoff event drew more than 400 people. (Hamida's dad ate 10 tacos). More than 1 400 people attended the second happening  held a couple of weeks later at the Islamic Society. Since then  #TacoTrucksAtEveryMosque has traveled as far south as Baja California  in Mexico  and as far north as Sacramento  where they held an event last week. All told   Hamida  estimates  they 've served 7 300 people â and nearly 29 000 tacos â at the seven events  they 've held so far. ( They 've also inspired imitators.)
The taco tour quickly got national attention â a profile on NBC Nightly News  stories in the Los Angeles Times and PRI's The World. It even got the attention of Gutierrez: On Instagram  he posted a video of  Hamida  with the message  ""I tried to warn you people. #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner has mutated into #TacoTrucksatEveryMosque!""
The next taco tour won't happen until May. In the meantime   Hamida  and Vazquez are preparing high school Latino-Muslim unity lectures where students will snack on halal tacos. ""At the end of the events  they're not talking about how amazing the halal tacos are  although the tacos are great  "" Hamida  points out. ""They're saying  'Now  we can fight together.'

3765,No. 16 Washington regrouping after 2nd straight road loss,Chris Petersen,"SEATTLE (AP)  â Chris Petersen  acknowledges  he 's awful when it comes to handling losses.
""I'm a bad loser. That's a flaw that I have and even when we win can't wait to put on the tape to figure out what went wrong  "" Petersen  said after having the weekend to think about Washington's 30-22 loss Friday to Stanford. ""When you lose you always think we didn't play hard enough  our energy wasn't right  whatever. Those kids played hard and my hats off to them.""
Washington should know shortly after kicking off against Utah on Saturday night what its title chances are since Stanford and California play earlier in the evening.  Petersen  said  he  won't be seeking updates on what is happening in the Bay Area.
""There's still so much football to be played in these two games  so much crazy stuff happens. And it doesn't matter what happens (elsewhere) ""  he  said. ""We have no say over that. All we can control is playing as hard as we can. Let's play this week  let's get to the following week. These will be two really tough games and I know this: We'll feel really good about ourselves if we can get that done. Because these are going to be tough challenges.""
""They held the ball  converted third downs  ate up the clock  ran the ball well â that's what they do ""  Petersen  said. ""And they did it better than us. I tell our guys  if we're playing with all we've got and our mind's right  our energy is right and we're physical and someone beats us  we don't like it. It's tough to stomach  but you tip your hat and move on. That night  those guys played better than us.""
""That's a little frustrating that you start fast and disappear at certain times during the game that you'd like to be a little bit more consistent ""  Petersen  said.

3766,Mugabe agrees to stand down as Zimbabwe president: source,Robert Mugabe,"HARARE (Reuters) -  Robert Mugabe  agreed on Sunday to resign as Zimbabweâs president hours after the ruling ZANU-PF party fired him as its leader following 37 years in charge  a source familiar with the negotiations said.

The source said the Zimbabwe military was working on a resignation statement by  Mugabe   without giving details.
Zimbabweâs state broadcaster ZBC said  Mugabe  would address the nation shortly. Earlier on Sunday  the official Herald newspaper showed pictures of  him  meeting top generals at  his  State House offices.
 Mugabe  the only leader the southern African nation has known since independence from Britain in 1980   was replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa  the deputy he sacked this month in a move that triggered the mid-week intervention by the army.
In scenes unthinkable just a week ago  the announcement drew cheers from the 200 delegates packed into ZANU-PFâs Harare headquarters to seal the fate of  Mugabe   whose support has crumbled in the four days since the army seized power.
 Mugabe  was given until noon (5.00 a.m. ET) on Monday to resign or face impeachment  an ignominious end to the career of the âGrand Old Manâ of African politics who was once feted across the continent as an anti-colonial liberation hero.
Even in the West   he  was renowned in  his  early years as the âThinking Manâs Guerrillaâ  an ironic nickname for a man who would later proudly declare  he  held a âdegree in violenceâ.
As the economy crumbled and political opposition to  his  rule grew in the late 1990s   Mugabe  seized thousands of white-owned farms  detained opponents and unleashed security forces to crush dissent.
When the vote was announced  war veterans leader Chris Mutsvangwa  who has spearheaded an 18-month campaign to remove a man he openly described as a âdictatorâ  embraced colleagues and shouted: â The President  is gone. Long live  the new President .â
 Mugabe âs 52-year-old wife Grace  who had harbored ambitions of succeeding her husband  was also expelled from ZANU-PF  along with at least three cabinet ministers who had formed the backbone of her âG40â political faction.
If  Mugabe  refused to go  âwe will bring back the crowds and they will do their business â Mutsvangwa told reporters.

On Saturday  men  women and children ran alongside the armored cars and troops who stepped in to target what the army called âcriminalsâ in  Mugabe âs inner circle.
âYou canât fire a Revolutionary leader!â he wrote on this Facebook page. âZANU-PF is nothing without  President Mugabe .â
Despite the euphoria  some  Mugabe  opponents are uneasy about the prominent role played by the military  and fear Zimbabwe might be swapping one army-backed autocrat for another  rather than allowing the people to choose their next leader.","HARARE (Reuters) -   [TGT] agreed on Sunday to resign as Zimbabweâs president hours after the ruling ZANU-PF party fired  [TGT]  as its leader following 37 years in charge  a source familiar with the negotiations said.

3767,The worldâs most valuable bitcoin startup just grabbed an ex,Tina Bhatnagar,"Coinbase just hired former Twitter and Salesforce executive Tina Bhatnagar to improve the company's customer support .
 Bhatnagar  has two major tasks: to double the size of the company's support team in three months  and to expand  its  phone support into a 24/7 service by the second quarter of 2018.
 The $1.6 billion cryptocurrency startup Coinbase  has hired a new executive to manage customer support   the company  announced Monday.
Tina Bhatnagar â who formerly worked in executive-level operations roles at both Twitter and Salesforce â will serve as vice president of operations and technology at  Coinbase .  Bhatnagar  left Twitter in June after five years at  the company .
Customer service has long been a problem for  Coinbase  and  its  10 million users.  The cryptocurrency exchange  is by far the most valuable startup in the sector  and arguably the most popular. But  its  ability to manage customer complaints â ranging from frozen accounts to thousands of dollars in missing funds â hasn't kept up with user demand.
 Bhatnagar  will to manage the customer side teams at  Coinbase  and at  its  professional-grade product GDAX.  She 's tasked with doubling the size of  Coinbase 's support team in the next three months  and expanding its four-month-old phone support program into a 24/7 service by the second quarter of 2018   the company  said.
âWhen deciding to join  Coinbase   I was not blind to the challenges ahead of me. But when I met [CEO Brian Armstrong] and the team  I knew it would be a truly joint effort to run  our  customer operations how  we  envisioned it ""  Bhatnagar  said in a statement.
 Coinbase  has been working on growing  its  support for months
 Coinbase  committed to growing  its  customer support team in August  when  it  raised a $100 million Series D at a $1.6 billion valuation.
 The company  added customer service phone support in September  to address months of user complaints across Reddit and Twitter describing arduous and often unsuccessful attempts at reaching  the company  via e-mail.
 Coinbase  has also doubled down on efforts to expand  its  executive team beyond  its  founders  to include more industry veterans to help  it  scale. Longtime tech executive Asiff Hirji joined  Coinbase  in December as president and chief operating officer  replacing Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam.
On January 10   Coinbase  promoted longtime employee Dan Romero to the newly created role of general manager  where he will also focus on customer service. Romero previously held the role that Bhatnagar is filling.
""My number one priority for  Coinbase  is providing our customers with a great experience "" Romero said in an announcement. ""We have been failing at this and it is totally unacceptable.""","Coinbase just hired  [TGT]  to improve the company's customer support .

 Hayek   who regularly starred in films released by Weinstein's Miramax in the 1990s  credited Weinstein with helping  her  start  her  career. But  she  said that the movie mogul would turn up at  her  door ""at all hours of the night  hotel after hotel  location after location.""

In order to finish what was a labor of love for  Hayek    she  agreed. But  she  said  she  had a nervous breakdown while shooting the scene. ""My body wouldn't stop crying and convulsing "" wrote  Hayek .
""It was not because I would be naked with another woman ""  she  wrote. ""It was because I would be naked with  her  for Harvey Weinstein.""

3771,Fed's Kashkari : Low inflation means I can't support rate hikes,Kashkari,"Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  said Tuesday  he  keeps voting against interest rate hikes because of low inflation and troubling bond market signals.
""Why are we raising rates when inflation is low and falling?""  Kashkari   a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee  asked during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
""More recently  we're seeing warning signs from the bond market ""  he  added. ""We've raised interest rates. The front end of the curve has gone up but the long end of the curve has stayed anchored. That flattening is also sending a concerning signal. ""
Kashkari  said the GOP's tax bill could help the Fed make its inflation target. The House is expected to vote on a bill as early as Tuesday. But  Kashkari  added  he  would have preferred the bill be made ""revenue neutral. ""
Kashkari  was a dissenter last week in the Federal Reserve's decision to raise its benchmark interest rate a quarter point to a target range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. It was the third rate hike this year and the fifth since 2006. The two other moves were in December 2015 and December 2016. The Fed projects three more rate increases for 2018.
But  Kashkari  warned in an interview Monday that continued rate increases by the Fed could drive the U.S. economy into a recession.
""It's possible we could end the expansion by our own actions ""  he  said in the interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Other Fed members have thought differently than  Kashkari  and have become increasingly worried that without rate increases the labor market could overheat. Fed Chair Janet Yellen and others in past speeches have expressed some optimism that more aggressive fiscal policy could be a help the economy grow.
In  his  interview Tuesday   Kashkari  told CNBC it's the not the Fed's responsibility to protect investors from the stock market corrections.","[TGT] said Tuesday   [TGT]   keeps voting against interest rate hikes because of low inflation and troubling bond market signals.

3773,Resignations fallout grow for embattled producer Weinstein,Harvey Weinstein,"LOS ANGELES (AP) â A prominent attorney said Saturday she is no longer representing movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as he confronts sexual harassment allegations dating back years  while a TV news anchor lodged another claim of misconduct against the movie mogul and a third board member resigned from Weinstein's company.
President Donald Trump  preparing to board a helicopter to travel from the White House to a North Carolina fundraiser on Saturday  was asked by reporters to weigh in on the embattled Hollywood figure. ""I've known Harvey Weinstein a long time "" Trump replied. When asked if he was surprised by the accusations  the president replied: ""I'm not at all surprised to see it.""
""Authors  actors  and moviemakers should not work for any  Weinstein  company until  he  resigns. Not a close call "" she tweeted  along with this:  ""Harvey Weinstein  needs to resign from  his  companies  face  his  sickness  and go into a long  self-imposed exile.""
 Weinstein  has exerted power in Hollywood for three decades  producing films including ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Shakespeare in Love "" for which  he  won an Oscar. But  his  stature has diminished in recent years and  his  company has suffered from a string of executive exits  layoffs mounting lawsuits and delayed releases.
The New York Times article chronicled allegations against  Weinstein  from Judd and former employees at both The Weinstein Co. and  Weinstein 's former company  Miramax  over the course of several decades. The report made an enormous impact felt throughout the movie industry and elsewhere.
The board of directors has pressured  Weinstein  to step down from the company  he  helped create  said a person familiar with the board's deliberations who was not authorized to speak publicly.  Weinstein  has resisted  hoping to weather the storm. Discussions between  Weinstein  and the board have been heated and contentious  the person said.
Leadership of the Weinstein Co. will be assumed by Bob Weinstein  who is  Harvey Weinstein's  brother  and David Glasser  the company's chief operating officer.
 Harvey Weinstein  on Thursday issued a lengthy statement that acknowledged causing ""a lot of pain.""  He  also asked for ""a second chance."" But  Weinstein  and  his  lawyers  including Harder  have criticized the New York Times' report in statements and interviews  though neither has referenced anything specific.
"" We  are confident in the accuracy of  our  reporting "" said a New York Times spokesperson in a statement. "" Mr. Weinstein  was aware and able to respond to specific allegations in  our  story before publication. In fact   we  published  his  response in full.""
In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday   Weinstein  attorney Lisa Bloom had both defended  Weinstein  and acknowledged he'd been ""stupid."" She saluted the women who have come forward to allege wrongdoing but said many allegations were overblown and consisted of  Weinstein  telling a woman she ""looked cute without my glasses.""

3774,Race factored into ESPNâs decision not to fire Jemele Hill Disney CEO says â TheBlaze,Bob Iger,"Bob Iger  the CEO of ESPNâs parent company Disney  explained Tuesday that the racial context surrounding ESPN host Jemele Hillâs tweets calling President Donald Trump a white supremacist informed his decision not to fire her.
 Iger âs explanation
âItâs hard for me to understand what it feels like to experience racism â  Iger  said at Vanity Fairâs New Establishment Summit. âI felt we needed to take into account what other people at ESPN were feeling at this time and that resulted in us not taking action.â
 Iger  also said the events of the past several months in America have outraged many people  and that the promises of the U.S. Constitution  fought for through the Civil War and the civil rights movement  have been âthe oppositeâ of what Americans have seen recently.
Is  Iger  posturing for a 2020 run?
Speculation has come and gone for years now about whether  Iger  has aspirations of running for president. With  Iger  commenting on recent events such as the Las Vegas shooting (gun control) and national anthem protests  the question of whether  Iger  is prepping for a presidential run have resurfaced.
 Iger  hasnât said  he  wants to run  but  he  very conspicuously hasnât said that  he  wonât run when directly asked about it.
âWell  hereâs what Iâve ruled in â  Iger  said to Bloomberg Television. âIâve ruled in the fact that I have a full-time job right now  and I love this job  and Iâm committed to it  and Iâm spending all my time on that and on my family.â
 He  might not have a full-time job in a few years  however.  He  originally planned to retire in the summer of 2018  but recently extended  his  contract through July 2019. If  he  steps down then   he  could be stepping right into a presidential campaign  if  he  chooses to.","[TGT] explained Tuesday that the racial context surrounding ESPN host Jemele Hillâs tweets calling President Donald Trump a white supremacist informed  [TGT]  decision not to fire her.

3775,Baker Mayfield Josh Rosen  Josh Allen and Sam Darnold meet media at combine,Josh Allen,"Mayfield  UCLA's Josh Rosen  Wyoming's  Josh Allen  and Southern California's? Sam Darnold all have the potential to be the top quarterback selected. Many personnel evaluators around the league have said this year's group has tried to show elite-level confidence in the informal interviews at the combine  even more than the usual confidence the position requires to succeed.
 Allen  and Darnold have trained together in their pre-draft work  and  Allen  said earlier this year that  he  knew  he  had ""a lot of flaws as a quarterback"" but ""can be that guy to lead a team.""
 Allen  had just two seasons as a starter at Wyoming and played in just 11 games last season due to injuries. But  he  has consistently flashed a power arm  including at the Senior Bowl practices in January.
 His  56.3 career completion rate is a cause for concern for some in the NFL  given that quarterbacks often have a difficult time substantially improving that statistic when they face more man-to-man coverage in the NFL with smaller throwing windows.
 Allen  met with nine teams Friday night. After that   he  plans to eliminate accuracy concerns this weekend and at  his  pro day on March 23.
""Hopefully  when we step on the field and throw  people see improvement  "" Allen  said. ""Whenever my feet are set  I'm as accurate as anybody.""
Darnold  too  played just two seasons of college football and will not even turn 21 until just before  he  opens  his  first NFL training camp in July. Darnold became USC's first 4 000-yard passer last season  with 4 143 yards  and  he  threw 57 touchdown passes in  his  two seasons as a starter combined.
 Allen  -- whose go-to word is ""super"" -- is prepared for any draft scenario.  His  assessment of the Giants' quarterback situation was particularly telling.  He  wants to play but is willing to sit behind Eli Manning for a while.
""If I got the opportunity to go and sit behind  him  for one or two or even three years and learn everything I could  grabbing  him  whenever I had a question  and hopefully  he  would answer it for me. Just seeing what  he  would do on and off the field would be really big for myself ""  Allen  said.","Mayfield  UCLA's Josh Rosen  Wyoming's   [TGT]   and Southern California's?

3778,Shirtless Vladimir Putin takes dip in icy Russian lake for the Epiphany,Vladimir Putin,"Another outdoor excursion in Russian's vast wilderness  another series of shirtless  Vladimir Putin  photos.
The brawny  bare-chested Russian leader  65  was photographed Thursday taking a dip in the frigid cold waters of Lake Seliger  located about five hours northwest of Moscow.  Putin  was celebrating the Epiphany  which in Eastern Christianity  commemorates the baptism of Jesus Christ.
While this most recent outing was spiritual in nature   his  past shirtless endeavors have illustrated  his  fondness for celebrating all things machismo.
One of the most iconic photos -- and one of the first shirtless images to nearly break the Internet -- is of a shirtless  Putin  in August 2009 riding a horse while on vacation outside the town of Kyzyl in Southern Siberia.
And this past August  the leader -- who some may say has a ""dad bod"" -- was photographed sunbathing  fishing and hiking in Southern Siberia.  He  was also photographed sunbathing and fishing with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu  who also dropped  his  top.

3779,Devin Nunes blows up at Jeff Sessions FBI's Chris Wray on Trump,Christopher Steele,"It is unclear whether Nunes â whose signature was the only one to appear on the letter and who  as chairman  has the power to sign off on subpoenas â was acting on behalf of committee Republicans when he subpoenaed ""any and all documents relating to the agencies' relationship with  former British Secret Intelligence Service officer Christopher Steele  and/or the so-called 'Trump dossier'"" on August 24.
Nunes' subpoenas  to which the DOJ and FBI apparently did not respond by the September 1 deadline  also covered documents ""memorializing FBI's relationship with  Mr. Steele   any payments made to  Mr. Steele   and efforts to corroborate information provided by Mr. Steele and  his  sub-sources â whether directly or via Fusion GPS.""
Fusion GPS  an opposition research firm  hired  Steele  in late 2015 to dig up dirt on then-candidate Trump on behalf of anti-Trump Republicans. Democrats took over funding for the research after Trump won the Republican nomination.

Conservatives have started doling out coffee-pod punishment because Keurig pulled its ads from  Hannity 's FOX News show  USA Today reports.
The decision came in the wake of  Hannity 's coverage of the sexual misconduct allegations against Roy Moore  the Alabama Senate candidate who was accused of pursuing a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32.
Keurig is just one of a handful of companies to pull its ad spots after  Hannity  appeared to call Moore's relationship with a 14-year-old ""consensual "" only to later say he misspoke.

3782,Karlie Kloss Coding's Supermodel: The Forbes Cover Story,Kode Klossy,"Karlie Kloss is sitting in a glass-walled SoHo office holding court with five teenage girls. Over video chat with several more  they are brainstorming how to support scholars of Kode with  Klossy  once class is out. The teenagers are all graduates of Kode with Klossy summer camps  an initiative by Klossâ education nonprofit that aims to teach girls the basics of computer programming.
In her off-duty uniform of a Planned Parenthood T-shirt  black jeans and Gucci loafers  the 6'2"" supermodel listens intently. One young woman wearing a white Kode with Klossy top suggests a custom app for students to communicate through. Kloss nods and encourages more ideas. Perhaps Kode with  Klossy  could upload lesson videos for scholars to look back on  or start a newsletter with events and internships. Another girl in glasses says she posts tricky coding problems on Snapchat and scholars from her camp offer solutions.
Her first taste came in 2014  when she signed up for a two-week boot camp at adult-education company the Flatiron School in Manhattan to learn the basics of computer programming. ""I didn't actually know who she was "" says Avi Flombaum  cofounder of the Flatiron School  who taught  Kloss â class. ""She was the best student in that group and I was surprised by how enthusiastic she was.""
 Kloss  covered the basics of Ruby on Rails  a popular web development framework. But she quickly noticed that her classes werenât gender equal  an imbalance that mirrored the tech workforce. ""I was curious  why are there not more women in this space?"" recalls  Kloss . An idea for how to help took form: ""I realized  here I am with this platform and reach to young women across the country and around the world  "" Kloss  explains. ""If I could just help a handful of girls that would be really meaningful.""
In 2015   Kloss  spent more than $20 000 to personally underwrite 21 scholarships for teenage girls to the Flatiron Schoolâs two week pre-college coding class--the very class  she  had taken the year prior (Flatiron School matched the donation).
But  she  was itching to do more. Last summer   Kloss  took the initiative in-house  launching  her  own two-week summer camp for teenage girls aged 13 to 18 in New York  Los Angeles and  her  hometown of St. Louis.  Kloss  helped pick candidates  design the curriculum and select teachers;  its  graduates have gone on to win hackathons and land places at Ivy League universities. In June  the program expanded to 12 cities across the U.S.  with plans to grow further.
Adults are also included:  Last July Kloss  launched a year-long online scholarship with the Flatiron School that selected one woman every month to enroll in its full stack web development course. And whhile other nonprofits with similar missions  such as Girls Who Code and Black Girls Code  are far more established   Kloss'  reach brings  her  objective to millions.
To date  funding for Kode with  Klossy  programs has come from  Kloss   herself  and the brands  she  poses for. According to a familiar source   Kloss  has personally contributed into seven figures to Kode With  Klossy  since 2015.  She  has also redirected a slice of  her  modeling contracts with companies such as Adidas  Swarovski and Express to fund and support Kode with  Klossy . Ford's STEAM Experienceâan initiative focused on science  technology  engineering and mathematics disciplines as well as the arts  part of the car maker's philanthropic armâlent additional support to this summerâs camps.
""There are so many young women who really could change the world with this kind of opportunity  girls who self-select out because they don't see others in the industry that look like them "" says  Kloss .
The daughter of an emergency room physician   Kloss'  favorite subjects as a child were math and science. Had she not been discovered at a charity fashion show in a mall  aged 13  she might have become a doctor or a teacher  she says. Instead  she booked her first advertisement in 2007; that same year she landed her first major runway show  walking for Calvin Klein.
Her career quickly took off  but it went into overdrive with the advent of Instagram. Thanks to social media  says  Kloss   ""I could be seen as well as heard."" As her followers swelled  her fees increased. She premiered on Forbesâ highest-paid models list in 2014 banking $4 million pretax; this year  her contract earnings soared to $9 million in the 12 months prior to June 2017.
All of it serves to raise awareness for  Kode  with  Klossy . As she focuses on the nonprofit  she has pared down her modeling contracts to the most lucrative partnerships. Today  says Kloss  she works with ""partners that really are excited to work with me because of not just what I look like  but because of what I stand for."" It makes sense that her bookings have shifted from conventional beauty and fashion to tech; she can be seen in recent advertisements for electronics giant Samsung and website builder Wix.
For now  the aim is to grow quickly and cost-effectively. ""I've been thinking about  Kode  with  Klossy  like a startup "" says Kloss. The nonprofit's team is lean  with Kloss  her manager and business partner Penni Thow  five full-time employees and consultants plus help from three members of her management.","Karlie Kloss is sitting in a glass-walled SoHo office holding court with five teenage girls.

3784,AP Interview: Chinese editor Hu Shuli steps aside not down,Hu Shuli,"Far from it  says  Hu Shuli   founder of the financial magazine Caixin.
 Hu  listened one recent afternoon to the theories floating in China's chattering class about why  she  was handing over the editorial reins at Caixin  the only newsroom known for hard-hitting  investigative reporting in China â and dismissed them.
""Laughable rumors  "" Hu  snapped. ""I'm not stepping back or stepping down. You could say I'm stepping up.""
In a rare interview with the Associated Press   Hu  spoke bullishly about transitioning this month into a publisher role at the newsmagazine  she  co-founded in 2009  and about the prospects of the ""Me Too"" movement in China.  She  spoke more guardedly about censorship and declared Caixin as free as ever to conduct its signature muckraking reporting. China watchers say the space for independent journalism in the country  already one of the world's most censored news environments  is fast vanishing under President Xi Jinping.
""We always think there are stories to do and we don't think  'maybe this environment should be better '"" said  Hu . ""We've always felt we could do anything we wanted. It was just based on what our priorities are.""
 Hu  said  she  was handing the operation over to  her  long-time deputy Wang Shuo because of  her  age â  she  turns 65 this year.  She  will occasionally conduct major interviews and remain involved in major editorial decisions as an adviser to Wang  who  she  hired as a 25-year-old two decades ago.
Known for her political savvy  for 30 years  Hu  has published scoops that uncovered corporate malfeasance and government corruption without repercussions while other journalists fell afoul of authorities and landed in jail.  Her  publication blew open the government cover-up of the SARS epidemic in 2003 and has questioned countless deals among powerful companies  including state-backed enterprises.
Caixin's reshuffle comes shortly after Wang Qishan  an official widely seen as  Hu 's longtime ally  stepped down from the Communist Party's top leadership body  said Willy Lam  a political analyst at the Chinese University in Hong Kong.
"" Ms. Hu  is famous for being supercharged  full of energy "" Lam said. ""It's difficult to believe she's stepping aside because of age. It has to do with politics.""
 Hu  declined to discuss her relationship with Wang and denied that political factors were behind her move. In any case  Wang appears to retain significant influence: he joined a parliamentary delegation this week amid speculation that Xi might soon name him vice president.
Pressed nearly two years later   Hu  shook her head  saying she doesn't remember the incident.
Even though she has not directed coverage recently   Hu  said  she  is proud of  her  staff's reporting on sexual harassment and the #MeToo movement in China. Discussion of the subject has sometimes been censored on Chinese social media or branded as a destabilizing foreign movement. But the story has gained some domestic traction  including reports by state-run outlets like the official Xinhua news agency  which  Hu  praised.
""China also has this kind of problem ... China had the 'women hold up half the sky' revolutionary slogan â but the actual situation  the actual status of women â I think is a very profound issue "" said  Hu   adding that  she  wanted to do more to promote #MeToo.
 Hu  said most of  her  energy will be focused on developing Caixin's business model.
In October the company became the first Chinese news company to erect a paywall  a decision  Hu  made based on the success of leading western newspapers.  She  declined to discuss subscription or revenue numbers  but acknowledged that online revenues are not yet considered ""substantial.""
Wei Wuhui  a lecturer of new media at Shanghai Jiaotong University who was asked by  Hu  to consult on Caixin's paywall model last year  said the increasingly restrictive political atmosphere will affect Caixin. Apart from direct censorship  it will be hurt by the scarcity of young people willing to pursue journalism.","Far from it  says   [TGT] founder of the financial magazine Caixin.

3786,Knicks rally in 4th quarter comes up short in loss to Kings,Skal Labissiere,"SACRAMENTO  Calif. (AP) â  Skal Labissiere  was rejoicing in  his  tiebreaking 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left when Kings teammate Zach Randolph sprinted onto the court from the bench and picked up a technical foul.
It seemed costly at the time. Still   all Labissiere  could do was laugh.
""I told  him   he 's too old to be doing stuff like that   he 's been in the league too long  "" Labissiere  said after Sacramento held off the New York Knicks 102-99 on Sunday night despite blowing a 19-point lead in the final quarter.
 Labissiere  then got the ball outside the arc and twice thought about passing it before he threw up a desperation heave with time running out.
""It's one of the plays we run down the stretch  "" Labissiere  said. ""Usually the ball ends up with either (De'Aaron) Fox or (Bogdanovic). It just so happened that I had it  read the play and decided to take the shot.""
Bogdanovic had 22 points and seven assists   Labissiere  had 14 points and six rebounds  and three others scored 12 points apiece for the Kings.

Opponents of  Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe  are preparing to demonstrate for the ouster of the 93-year-old leader who is virtually powerless and deserted by most of  his  allies.

3791,Obituary: Asma Jahangir died on February 11th,Asma Jahangir,"OBSERVERS of Asma Jahangir  usually male ones  would sometimes ask why  she  was so angry. From the 1980s onwards  she  seemed at the centre of every demonstration in Lahore or Islamabad  all five feet two inches of  her   glasses glinting  gesticulating  shouting.  She  led marches  held marathons  set up awkward organisations  and in every way was a gadfly. Most of all   she  spoke  her  mind. It might be in the bar room of the Lahore High Court  through a furious cloud of beedi smoke  or in court itself  dressing down judges who didnât get the point  or at a police station  still protesting. Bemused by this fierce little lawyer  the men would shake their heads.
But in Pakistan  how could  she  be silent? There was so much pent-up anger  for so many reasons. Lack of democracy. Almost total lack of justice. Duffer generals  bigoted mullahs  crony capitalists  chauvinist men. Certainly  she  could be a well-behaved upper-middle-class woman  in elegant shalwar kameez in  her  wood-panelled house. But  she  would rather be a street fighter. Of course   she  paid for it.  She  was bundled into police vans  put under house arrest.  Her  car was trashed. Hitmen held  her  relatives hostage. The intelligence services tried to liquidate  her  as a traitor and foreign agent (though  her  early death was natural). Every attack left  her  more energised than ever. When  her  shirt was torn off for organising a protest   she  saved  her  modesty with safety pins and went on hectoring. Briefly in jail in 1983   she  thought it a great adventure.
 Her  model was  her  father  a parliamentarian who had resigned in 1971 to protest against military rule. He too had gone smiling  and often  to prison. As a teenager  she  was already a troublemaker  complaining at  her  convent about the undemocratic selection of the head girl. In  her  prim school uniform   she  also scaled the gate of the Punjab governorâs house to plant a black flag against military rule. Rustication followed  to  her  joy.
When the phone rang at  her  law offices in Lahore   she  would always answer it. If  she  missed a call   she  would swiftly return it. Someone needed help  and  she  was often the only person in the country they could turn to.  Her  critics sometimes accused  her  of profiting from adversity  being a glory seeker. On the contrary   she  was defending democracy  secularism  judicial independence  human rights. Simple tenets  but not in Pakistan.  She  had come to the law enchanted with it  studying it at home because  she  was debarred  as a woman  from lectures.  She  believed in its power to right wrongs.  Her  tartness in court expressed  her  fury with the slow  corrupt  uneven way it actually worked.
High-profile cases did not attract  her .  She  preferred to defend a 14-year-old Christian boy accused of scrawling blasphemy on the wall of a village mosque  and to save him from the death penalty  which  she  abhorred. Though  she  was Muslim  herself   it was a personal matter.  She  accepted the place of sharia in the legal system of Pakistan  but battled its harsher interpretations. In 1987  she  helped set up the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP)  the first of its kind  to keep an eye on things.  Her  presence on the Lahore High Court and later as the first woman president of the Supreme Court Bar Association  encouraged liberal lawyers and outraged conservatives  whom  she  mocked for their backwardness and beards.
 She  was eager to represent the poor. In half  her  cases  she  took no payment. For a time  she  even funnelled money to struggling families of political prisoners and abductees. Once  she  fought for a group of half-naked bonded brickmakers  who owed thousands of rupees to their employers. When the judge asked  her  why  she  had brought people into his court who stank   she  replied  bluntly  that he was there precisely for them. Ideally  to weaken the feudal system that enslaved them. At the least  to listen to the victims.
And no group was victimised more than women. They were treated as possessions in Pakistan  beings who should not question and should not think.  She  knew about that. As a young mother  even with a law degree   she  had been forbidden to work and reduced to a nothing. So in 1980  she    her  sister Hina and two friends set up the first all-woman law firm in the country.  Her  husband objected  but  she  went ahead. The year before President Zia ul-Haq had brought in military rule and severe hudood punishments  so  her  firm was needed.  She  defended girls  raped by their bosses  who now faced flogging for fornication;  she  helped women trying to escape loveless marriages  one of whom was killed in  her  law offices at  her  motherâs instigation.  She  provided a shelter for them  again the first. By this year  she  felt women had made progress. But not nearly enough.
With so much energy and noise   she  was noticed internationally.  She  became a UN special rapporteur for human rights  travelling to Iran  Afghanistan  Palestine and Chiapas. All the cases  she  encountered caused  her  anguish  but  her  chief concern remained Pakistan. For all the danger to  her    she  had never thought of leaving.  Her  ancestors were buried there. It was home. And like the typical Punjabi mother she was  nagging her daughters on how they should keep house  she needed to lecture Pakistan first. And keep on.

3794,Madigan and the 'changing' culture in Springfield,Boss Madigan,"And since everyone is equal under the law  even in Illinois  Iâd bet that  Illinoisâ supreme political boss  Democratic House Speaker Mike Madigan  lord of all he surveys   is taking his sexual harassment training too.
No one in their right mind would ever think  Boss Madigan  capable of sexual harassment.  He âs a family man  a gentleman  loving dad and husband  brilliant  hardworking and incredibly disciplined.
 He âs also a ruthless  wealthy political warlord who controls Illinois by force of will and has turned the state into an overtaxed wasteland.
 Madigan  is of the old school: strait-laced iron curtain; a character straight out of Charles Dickens  thin  bony and entirely without blood.
 He  likes money and power. But sex and  Mike Madigan ? Impossible.
It took me over two hours just to type the words âsexâ and â Mike Madigan â in the same sentence. And now my fingers are cramped and Iâll probably have to stick pins in them or soak them in holy water to release the painful claw effect.
 He  stands accused but not charged  though  he âs been stripped by the powers that be of  his  leadership position and the extra cash that comes with it.
Ever since  he  was accused â quite publicly at a public hearing â lawmakers have been busy issuing bill after bill  determined to show us theyâre changing the culture down there.
That inspector general wrote a scathing report about  Madigan  and contracts and  Madigan  political patronage at Metra  the clout-rich transportation bureaucracy that moves commuters across the metropolitan area.
 Madigan  was furious. This helped make me a bunch of columns  though  and  his  daughter  Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan went around telling people they were reading âtoo much John Kass â so I was grateful.
That law enforcement officer  of course  is  Lisa Madigan .
What bothered lawmakers is that  Madigan   testifying  himself  on one of  his  own change-the-culture harassment bills  knew all about the forgotten ethics complaints.
âEthics is a real issue  a serious issue  especially in Illinois â  she  said. âAnd yet all weâre doing now is rushing bill after bill. Why? We didnât do anything for three years to fill that inspector spot. And now weâre rushing to tweak this and tweak that?","And since everyone is equal under the law  even in Illinois  Iâd bet that  Illinoisâ supreme political boss  Democratic House Speaker Mike Madigan  lord of all he surveys   is taking his sexual harassment training too.
No one in their right mind would ever think   [TGT]  [TGT]  âs a family man  a gentleman  loving dad and husband  brilliant  hardworking and incredibly disciplined.
  [TGT]  âs also a ruthless  wealthy political warlord who controls Illinois by force of will and has turned the state into an overtaxed wasteland.
  [TGT] is of the old school: strait-laced iron curtain; a character straight out of Charles Dickens  thin  bony and entirely without blood.
  [TGT]   likes money and power. But sex and   [TGT]  ? Impossible.
It took me over two hours just to type the words âsexâ and  [TGT]  â in the same sentence. And now my fingers are cramped and Iâll probably have to stick pins in them or soak them in holy water to release the painful claw effect.
 He  stands accused but not charged  though  he âs been stripped by the powers that be of  his  leadership position and the extra cash that comes with it.
Ever since  he  was accused â quite publicly at a public hearing â lawmakers have been busy issuing bill after bill  determined to show us theyâre changing the culture down there.
That inspector general wrote a scathing report about  Madigan  and contracts and  Madigan  political patronage at Metra  the clout-rich transportation bureaucracy that moves commuters across the metropolitan area.
 Madigan  was furious. This helped make me a bunch of columns  though  and  his  daughter  Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan went around telling people they were reading âtoo much John Kass â so I was grateful.
That law enforcement officer  of course  is  Lisa Madigan .
What bothered lawmakers is that  Madigan   testifying  himself  on one of  his  own change-the-culture harassment bills  knew all about the forgotten ethics complaints.
âEthics is a real issue  a serious issue  especially in Illinois â  she  said. âAnd yet all weâre doing now is rushing bill after bill. Why?

3795,NCAA Faults Louisville Basketball Program For Ethics And Oversight In Sex Scandal : The Two,McGee,"The operations director at the time was  Andre McGee  who became an assistant coach shortly after his collegiate career ended at Louisville . The infractions panel says  McGee  committed further violations by refusing to cooperate with the NCAA's inquiry  denying requests for an interview and withholding records.
The NCAA investigation comes nearly two years after Katina Powell  a woman who described herself as a former escort  published a book titled Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball And The Escort Queen. In it  Powell accused  McGee  of paying her ""to provide strippers at dorm room parties for basketball players and recruits from 2010-2014 "" as the Two-Way reported in 2015.
Many of those parties took place at the players' dorm  Billy Minardi Hall  on the edge of campus. The rules committee says Pitino acknowledged that after putting  McGee  in charge of the dorm  he and his other assistants had no interactions with visiting prospects from 10 p.m. until the next morning.
 McGee  was hired onto the coaching staff one year after  he  had played for Pitino and the Cardinals as the starting point guard. The NCAA says that when Pitino hired  McGee  and placed  him  in Minardi Hall   he  ""essentially placed a peer of the student-athletes in a position of authority over them and visiting prospects.""
After the revelations came out in Powell's book  Pitino said he was ""disheartened  disappointed.""

3799,Farenthold retiring from House amid harassment accusations,Blake Farenthold,"WASHINGTON (AP) â  Texas Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold  announced Thursday that  he  won't seek re-election next year  adding  his  name to the list of lawmakers leaving Congress amid sexual harassment allegations that have cost powerful men their jobs in politics  the arts and other industries.
In a five-minute video on  his  campaign's Facebook page   Farenthold  denied a former aide's three-year-old accusations  which included that  he 'd subjected  her  to sexually suggestive comments and behavior and then fired  her  after  she  complained. But  he  apologized for an office atmosphere  he  said included ""destructive gossip  offhand comments  off-color jokes and behavior that in general was less than professional.""
House Speaker Paul Ryan  R-Wis.  told reporters  he 'd spoken twice to the Texan on Wednesday and suggested there were additional accusations that had yet to surface.
""Unacceptable behavior has been alleged in those stories  and I think  he 's made the right decision that  he 's going to be leaving Congress and that reflects some of the conversations we've had "" Ryan said.
 Farenthold 's decision comes as congressional leaders have shown little desire for lawmakers facing credible harassment allegations to remain in Congress as 2018 elections roll into view.
Democrats had criticized Ryan for not forcing  Farenthold  out sooner. But Republicans cited a recommendation by the independent Office of Congressional Ethics that the House Ethics Committee dismiss the allegations.
""There is not substantial reason to believe that  Representative Farenthold  sexually harassed or discriminated against complainant "" the office had said.
 Farenthold   a seven-year House veteran  had said he'd engaged in no wrongdoing when he settled the case in 2015. But after congressional sources said he'd paid the $84 000 settlement using taxpayers' money  the House Ethics Committee said last week it would investigate him and public focus intensified  even though he said he'd reimburse the Treasury Department.

In his video   Farenthold  said if he stayed in Congress  he'd have to spend months trying to vindicate himself.
The lawsuit by former  Farenthold  aide Lauren Greene alleged that the congressman had discussed his sexual fantasies about her and said at a staff meeting that a lobbyist had propositioned him for a threesome. It accused  Farenthold  of repeatedly complimenting her appearance  then joking that he hoped the comments wouldn't be construed as sexual harassment.
Five Republicans filed to challenge  Farenthold  in Texas' March 6 Republican primary even before he resigned.
 Farenthold  upset long-serving Democratic U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz during the tea party wave of 2010  but  the district  has since been redrawn to make  it  more reliably Republican. That included removing many areas along the Texas-Mexico border which had favored Democrats.","WASHINGTON (AP) â   [TGT] announced Thursday that   [TGT]   won't seek re-election next year  adding   [TGT]   name to the list of lawmakers leaving Congress amid sexual harassment allegations that have cost powerful men their jobs in politics  the arts and other industries.

Barth  like others in the article  alleges that she was invited under the guise of a business meeting to  Weinstein 's hotel room  where she says he proceeded to demand a naked massage.
After telling  Weinstein   ""Thatâs not going to happen "" Barth says she left the room and started crying uncontrollably.
Barth's former director and co-star for her appearances in the ""Ted"" films  Seth MacFarlane  took to Twitter today to explain a joke he made about  Weinstein  when the actor hosted the Oscars in 2013.

The ""Family Guy"" creator applauded Barth and the other women who spoke out about their alleged experiences with  Weinstein .
In response to the women who spoke out on Tuesday  a spokesperson for the movie executive told The New Yorker: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by  Mr. Weinstein .""
 ""Mr. Weinstein  has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing  his  advances.

With 273 367 votes    [TGT] has a sizable lead over Tom Brady  whose tally of 239 989 makes  him  the second-most popular player so far. While   [TGT] is looking to be selected for   [TGT]   first Pro Bowl  Brady  whose 8-2 Patriots are tied with the Steelers atop the AFC  is well on  his  way to  his  13th selection.
Through 10 games    [TGT] has a similar lead  25-22  over Brady among all quarterbacks in touchdown passes. The Eagles star  24  is fourth in passer rating  at 103.4  a category the 40-year-old Brady leads at 110.9.
  [TGT]  âs completion percentage is down from   [TGT]   rookie season (59.7-62.4)  but other marks are much improved  including touchdown percentage (7.9-2.6)  interception percentage (1.6-2.3) and adjusted yards per pass attempt (8.5-5.7).  He  was the second overall pick in the 2016 draft  out of North Dakota State of the FCS  behind only Rams quarterback Jared Goff  whose 200 346 Pro Bowl votes have  him  in eighth place.",Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,

3806,Another Famous Conductor Charles Dutoit  Accused Of Sexual Assault : The Two,Charles Dutoit,"Another Famous Conductor   Charles Dutoit   Accused Of Sexual Assault
The Associated Press has reported allegations of sexual assault against the famed conductor  Charles Dutoit  made by four women  in incidents that span from 1985 to 2010 and that took place in five different U.S. cities.
After the AP published its report Thursday  six major American orchestras with decades-long ties to  Dutoit  â the Philadelphia Orchestra  the Boston Symphony Orchestra  the New York Philharmonic  the Chicago Symphony Orchestra  the Cleveland Orchestra and the San Francisco Symphony â hastily issued separate statements that distanced the respective institutions from the conductor to varying degrees.
In Britain  the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra also responded to the allegations  writing in a statement that it and  Dutoit  have "" jointly agreed to release  him  from  his  forthcoming concert obligations with the Orchestra for the immediate future.""
The alleged victims include one world-famous vocalist  the Grammy winning-soprano Sylvia McNair. Now 61  McNair told the AP that  Dutoit  ""tried to have  his  way"" with her after a rehearsal at the Minnesota Orchestra in 1985  when she was 28 years old.
Paula Rasmussen  a former professional mezzo-soprano  alleges that  Dutoit  assaulted her in his dressing room at the Los Angeles Opera in September 1991.
The other two accusers chose to remain anonymous  due to  Dutoit 's still-significant power within the classical music world.
One of those women  an anonymous soprano  claims that  Dutoit  assaulted her three times in 2006  at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs  N.Y.  and again in Philadelphia  in 2010.
The fourth accuser was 24 years old at the time of her alleged assault. She was a musician at the Civic Orchestra of Chicago  a ""training"" orchestra for emerging professional players associated with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO)  when  Dutoit  came to the city as a guest conductor of the CSO. She says he invited her to a lunch originally scheduled at a restaurant but then changed  at  Dutoit 's request  to his hotel suite at the Four Seasons  where he tried to force himself on her. In a series of emails the conductor allegedly sent to her afterwards  he wrote that he did not know that ""that an affectionate hug and kiss could have such a negative effect "" but that ""of course  I forgot you are still a child.""
The Philadelphia Orchestra â which Dutoit has conducted some 650 times since 1980 â said in a statement this evening that it was ""horrified to learn of  the deeply troubling accusations of sexual misconduct against Charles Dutoit . We had no knowledge of these allegations. The Association is committed to providing a safe and respectful work environment for all of its employees and guest artists. We have had no communication with Mr. Dutoit and he has no future engagements."" The Philadelphia symphony added  ""We deplore the type of behavior described by Mr. Dutoit's accusers and we recognize
our responsibility to be a forceful opponent of abuses of power. The seriousness of  the accusations  demands a thorough investigation. We offer our sincerest sympathy to those who have been impacted.""
 Dutoit 's upcoming U.S. performances were largely tied to a series of appearances with pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet  a longtime musical colleague: with the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center and with London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in a tour of California next month; with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Boston's Symphony Hall and with the Cleveland Orchestra at Cleveland's Severance Hall in February; and with the Chicago Symphony in April at the city's Symphony Center.
Thibaudet declined to comment on the allegations against  Dutoit .
Rather than make any declarations about future collaborations with  Dutoit  â or about anyone in the Philharmonic administration or orchestra's knowledge of his alleged behaviors â the New York orchestra released a brief statement Thursday night that said: ""In the wake of the very serious allegations reported today about  conductor Charles Dutoit    Mr. Dutoit  informed the New York Philharmonic that  he  has withdrawn from conducting concerts for the New York Philharmonic scheduled for January 17â20  2018. The New York Philharmonic remains committed to providing a professional and safe workplace  free of sexual harassment and all other forms of inappropriate conduct.""
After an initial statement in which the Chicago Symphony said it was taking the allegations seriously and was still determining the best course to follow  the CSO ultimately took a similar tack to the New York Philharmonic. In a terse statement  the CSO said: ""In response to the allegations about  conductor Charles Dutoit  reported in the media today   Mr. Dutoit  informed the Chicago Symphony Association (CSOA) that  he  has withdrawn from conducting concerts with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra scheduled for March 8  9  10 and 11  2018 and April 5  6  7 and 10  2018. The CSOA is committed to maintaining a workplace that is free from intimidation  coercion and harassment  including sexual harassment.""
Also Thursday  the Boston Symphony Orchestra  which was scheduled to feature Dutoit as a guest conductor in a series of February performances  released a statement severing its decadeslong ties with the conductor: ""Given the extremely troubling allegations against  Charles Dutoit  reported by Associated Press this morning  the Boston Symphony Orchestra will end its relationship with  him  and  he  will no longer appear as a guest conductor with the orchestra. The Boston Symphony Orchestra is committed to a zero tolerance policy towards anyone who exhibits inappropriate behavior in the workplace  and behavior that runs counter to these core values will always be met with serious consequences."" The BSO statement echoes the one the same orchestra released earlier this month regarding its relationship with James Levine  its former music director who also led the Metropolitan Opera for more than four decades.","Another  [TGT] Accused Of Sexual Assault

Florida State Seminoles head coach Jimbo Fisher . (Photo: Glenn Beil  USA TODAY Sports)
Texas A&M is expected to inquire about the interest level of Florida State coach  Jimbo Fisher  once its separation from current coach Kevin Sumlin is official at the end of the season  according to two people familiar with the situation.
Though  Fisher  has never given serious consideration to leaving Florida State previously  rebuffing interest from LSU the last two years  one person close to  Fisher  pointed to  his  longstanding relationship with Texas A&M athletics director Scott Woodward and the current disappointing season at Florida State as reasons why Texas A&Mâs pursuit might be more realistic.
Woodward arrived as an administrator at LSU in 2000  the same year  Fisher  was hired there as offensive coordinator under Nick Saban. They have remained in touch and friendly over the years  according to a person familiar with Fisherâs thinking.
Itâs far more uncertain whether  Fisher  would ultimately decide to leave a school where  he  has invested eight seasons as a head coach and three as the coach-in-waiting under Bobby Bowden  restoring the Seminoles to their former glory during a run of three consecutive ACC titles between 2012-14.
 Fisher  also has security at Florida State  as  he  is signed at $5.55 million annually through the 2024 season. The contract contains two automatic one-year rollovers that go into effect after each nine-win regular season.
Another significant factor is  his  family situation. Fisher and his ex-wife Candi divorced in December 2015  and their youngest son Ethan battles Fanconi anemia  a rare blood disorder. In previous discussions  staying close to his children has been a factor in  Fisher âs thinking about other jobs.
However  this season has gone poorly for  Fisher   as the Seminoles started at No. 3 in the polls but have stumbled to a 3-6 record. If he stays   Fisher  will be expected to tweak his coaching staff  as the Seminoles have been out of the ACC title race by the end of September each of the last two years.
Last month  after Florida Stateâs 31-28 home loss to Louisville   Fisher  confronted a fan who yelled âNew coaches  new coaches!â as the team walked off the field.

Last week  when  Fisher  was asked about Florida Stateâs rivalry with Clemson   he  added fuel to the fire with a comment that seemed to indicate  he  believes Clemson  with its new $55 million football facility  has surpassed Florida State in its financial commitment to winning national titles.
âI think their rise has come from their commitment to football â  Fisher  said. âTheyâve been committed but their administration has done a tremendous job of spending and doing and building. Not just building  but all the things behind the scenes.â
Asked what commitments  he âd like to see from Florida State   Fisher  responded: âThose things are a major  major deal. Unfortunately  in this business  when you get into the facilities business  youâre never out of it. Youâre never out of development. Your company can never quit growing. Whether itâs that or behind the scenes things  support staff  all that can never happen. It can never go away. If it does  people fly by you like crazy. And thereâs numerous examples across this country. If you donât understand that  youâre missing the boat.â
Those comments were not well-received among FSU fans and administrators  particularly given the contract extension  Fisher  received last December and the multimillion-dollar facility upgrades the school has made under  his  watch.
Fisherâs contract states that his only buyout responsibility to Florida State if he left would be the amount guaranteed to his assistant coaches â potentially as much as $7.2 million  but likely far less â as the contract is written in a way to protect the school from having to buy out those staff members should a new coach decide not to honor those contracts. In other words  if  Fisher  brought some or most of those staff members to a new school  their salaries likely wouldnât be owed to Florida State.","Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE SportsPulse: USA TODAY Sports' Paul Myerberg breaks down the Auburn Tigers' and Miami Hurricanes' big wins and what it means going forward.

Itâs far more uncertain whether   [TGT] would ultimately decide to leave a school where   [TGT]   has invested eight seasons as a head coach and three as the coach-in-waiting under Bobby Bowden  restoring the Seminoles to  [TGT]  former glory during a run of three consecutive ACC titles between 2012-14.
  [TGT] also has security at Florida State  as   [TGT]   is signed at $5.55 million annually through the 2024 season. The contract contains two automatic one-year rollovers that go into effect after each nine-win regular season.
Another significant factor is  his  family situation. Fisher and his ex-wife Candi divorced in December 2015  and their youngest son Ethan battles Fanconi anemia  a rare blood disorder. In previous discussions  staying close to his children has been a factor in   [TGT]  âs thinking about other jobs.
However  this season has gone poorly for  Fisher   as the Seminoles started at No. 3 in the polls but have stumbled to a 3-6 record. If  [TGT]  stays    [TGT] will be expected to tweak  [TGT]  coaching staff  as the Seminoles have been out of the ACC title race by the end of September each of the last two years.
Last month  after Florida Stateâs 31-28 home loss to Louisville    [TGT] confronted a fan who yelled âNew coaches  new coaches!â as the team walked off the field.

Last week  when   [TGT] was asked about Florida Stateâs rivalry with Clemson    [TGT]   added fuel to the fire with a comment that seemed to indicate   [TGT]   believes Clemson  with its new $55 million football facility  has surpassed Florida State in its financial commitment to winning national titles.
âI think their rise has come from their commitment to football â   [TGT] said. âTheyâve been committed but their administration has done a tremendous job of spending and doing and building. Not just building  but all the things behind the scenes.â
Asked what commitments  he âd like to see from Florida State    [TGT] responded: âThose things are a major  major deal. Unfortunately  in this business  when you get into the facilities business  youâre never out of it. Youâre never out of development. Your company can never quit growing. Whether itâs that or behind the scenes things  support staff  all that can never happen. It can never go away. If it does  people fly by you like crazy. And thereâs numerous examples across this country. If you donât understand that  youâre missing the boat.â
Those comments were not well-received among FSU fans and administrators  particularly given the contract extension  Fisher  received last December and the multimillion-dollar facility upgrades the school has made under  his  watch.
Fisherâs contract states that his only buyout responsibility to Florida State if he left would be the amount guaranteed to his assistant coaches â potentially as much as $7.2 million  but likely far less â as the contract is written in a way to protect the school from having to buy out those staff members should a new coach decide not to honor those contracts. In other words  if  Fisher  brought some or most of those staff members to a new school  their salaries likely wouldnât be owed to Florida State.",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive,Negative,Negative
3810,Buzz Over Oprah's 2020 BidÂ Leads to Debate Over Celebrity Candidates,Oprah Winfrey,"The hoopla over the possibility of  Oprah Winfrey  running for president following  her  powerful speech at the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday evening has raised questions whether it is good for the public that celebrities seek political office  The Hill reported on Tuesday.
Although in a not too distant era  the idea of someone like  Winfrey  running for president would not be taken seriously  the shocking victory of Donald Trump has changed that conception and made the possibility appear more realistic.
A wide range of strategists have expressed excitement about the idea of  her  launching a presidential bid.
USA Today reported that Democratic strategist Joe Trippi  who was campaign manager for Howard Dean's bid for president in 2004  said  ""If  she  decides to run   she  certainly would be the top contender  no doubt about it. All of the politicians who would think about running   she 'd be one of the people they'd have to get past.""
Plenty of others have joined in encouraging  her   with California Rep. Jackie Speier  for example sending out an excited tweet.
But Trippi countered that a  Winfrey  bid for president is not necessarily the wrong line of thinking.

3814,Weinstein accuser seeks to set legal precedent with sex trafficking law,Harvey Weinstein,"(Reuters) - The lawyer representing  Harvey Weinstein âs latest accuser is attempting to set legal precedent by contending  Weinstein âs actions overseas make  him  liable for civil damages under a criminal law against sex trafficking  five legal experts said.

The lawsuit  filed in U.S. District Court in New York  does not accuse  Weinstein  of labor trafficking or other exploitations commonly associated with the commercial sex industry. But the criminal law on which the civil claim in based bans the use of force  threat or coercion for a sex act in exchange for value.
Nobleâs lawsuit claimed  Weinstein  promised  her  a role in a Weinstein Company project and that he invited  her  to his hotel room in February 2014 in France on the premise of viewing  her  show reel  or video highlights of  her  acting.
Responding to the lawsuit  Holly Baird  a spokeswoman for  Weinstein   on Monday denied the allegation of non-consensual sex. Baird could not be reached on Tuesday for comment on the claim that  Weinstein  violated sex trafficking laws.

3826,David Wright understands why Mets couldn't wait on him any longer,David Wright,"PORT ST. LUCIE â It sounds as if  David Wright  finally has come to the realization â and to grips with â the likelihood that the end is near.
 Wright  spoke for the first time this spring at Mets camp on Saturday  and while  he  admirably refuses to give up on  his  multi-year quest to make it back to the field following multiple surgeries  the hobbled captain fully understands why the organization signed Todd Frazier as a more permanent replacement at third base this offseason.
 He  also understands why the Mets simply and clearly could not wait for  him  any longer.
âIâm going to give it my best shot  certainly. I probably have a lot of the same questions that youâre asking me  and a lot of people are asking of me. Because I just donât know â  Wright  said when asked in the home dugout at First Data Field how realistic  he  believes a return this season would be for  him . âItâs certainly been an uphill climb for me  so I guess to honestly answer your question  I donât know. Iâm not sure what the expectation is.
 Wright âs body has gone through more pain and trouble in the past few seasons than any pro athlete should have to endure  from the spinal stenosis that first was diagnosed in 2015 to the neck  back and shoulder surgeries the seven-time All-Star third baseman has undergone over the past two lost years of  his  career.
âCertainly  (itâs been) very frustrating â  the 35-year-old Wright  said. âWhen youâre used to doing something your entire life  and itâs kind of taken away from you  itâs definitely frustrating.
 David Wright  discusses the frustrations surrounding trying to get healthy. (Howard Simmons/New York Daily News)
For practically 15 years now   Wright  has been one of the most amicable and productive players ever produced by the Mets organization  and as such  I remain firmly in the camp that the decision to call it a career is  his  and  his  alone.
True to form   Wright  walked into Mickey Callawayâs office earlier in the week to ask what the new managerâs leadership expectations were of  him  while still rehabbing. âI would think everyone in baseball is rooting for  David Wright  to come back "" Callaway said.
If not  the Mets recouped 75 percent of  Wright âs $20 million salary last season  and will do so on the remaining three years and $47 million owed  him  should  he  never resume a career that once seemed to be on a Hall of Fame trajectory.
âIâve had a hard time with it certainly  but I guess you do what you can do and do everything in your power â  Wright  said. âThe biggest thing is I donât want to say when itâs all said and done I wish I would have done this or I wish I would have done that.
To that end   Wright  still has not even resumed running or any baseball activity. So even while saying  he  hopes to âbegin to try to ramp it up a little bit moreâ in the coming weeks  any immediate return appears out of the question anyway.
Which is why the Mets were fully justified in signing Frazier to a two-year deal to man third base for the next seasons after a couple of years of keeping the light on for  him  by mostly patch-working the position together.
âJeff (Wilpon) called me the night that it came out  which I very much appreciated  and he said he wanted to give me a heads up that  âhey  this is going to happenâ and that certainly meant a lot to me â  Wright  said. âThe way I look at is that weâre certainly  in my opinion  a very good team without me and my mindset is that weâll be a better team with both of us out there.
Another typically diplomatic response  to be sure  but itâs impossible for  even Wright  to ignore that the Frazier signing finally represents some concession by the Mets that he can no longer be counted on to come back successfully.","PORT ST.

""To me  that's a lack of respect for the game ""   [TGT] said. ""Maybe I'm being too picky on these guys. I'm starting to say things like  'Back when I played.' I thought I'd never say those words.""",Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,
3829,Bulls,Nikola Mirotic,"After  Nikola Mirotic  failed to evoke significant interest in restricted free agency last year  the Bulls and  his  representatives agreed on an intriguing proposal.
Rather than play this season on  his  $7.2 million qualifying offer  why not make a higher annual salary on a two-year  $25 million deal structured with a team option that could make Mirotic eminently tradable at some point in the deal?
And if  Mirotic  played well  which  he  has   he  might be able to net a first-round pick in return. Plus  the Bulls were â and still are â under the salary-cap floor.
The notion that itâs a matter of when  not if   Mirotic  is dealt picked up steam Tuesday.
Indeed  the creative structure to  Mirotic âs deal is both blessing and curse. The collective bargaining agreement allows  Mirotic  the right to reject a trade if the second-year team option isnât exercised.
 Mirotic  has never backed off  his  claim to want to be elsewhere â and start â after Bobby Portisâ punch Oct. 17 broke two facial bones and cost  Mirotic  23 games. The deal had attractiveness to it. Last season   Mirotic  called Rajon Rondo  now with the Pelicans  his favorite teammate along with Pau Gasol. And heâd start for a team challenging for the playoffs.
But sources said  Mirotic   for now  ultimately soured on waiving  his  guaranteed $12.5 million next season  not to mention  his  Bird rights. Those allow a team to go over the salary cap to sign  him  to a deal with higher annual raises than signing via a salary-cap exception.
Whether Miroticâs stance changes before the Feb. 8 trade deadline remains to be seen. The Bulls also could pick up his option â which negates  Mirotic âs ability to reject a trade â and then find a trading partner.
The Bulls and Jazz also remain in talks  sources said  and  Mirotic  is intrigued by the idea of playing for coach Quin Snyder.
 Mirotic  experienced an emotional day.  It  began with  him  testing  his  strained left leg on the practice floor. Then  he  got pulled into an office by coach Fred Hoiberg and ultimately left the facility while a practice  he  wasnât scheduled to participate in took place.
Sources said the decision weighed on  Mirotic  heavily.  He  ultimately boarded the Bulls charter flight to Portland  Ore.  on Tuesday afternoon.
Before that  Hoiberg was purposely vague regarding Miroticâs playing status. He answered âweâll seeâ and later that heâd âanticipate that he wouldâ when asked before practice if  Mirotic  would travel.

3832,Gospel star Edwin Hawkins  known for 'Oh Happy Day ' dies,Edwin Hawkins,"NEW YORK (AP) â Edwin Hawkins  the gospel star best known for the crossover hit ""Oh Happy Day"" and as a major force for contemporary inspirational music  died Monday at age 74.
 Hawkins  died at  his  home in Pleasanton  California.  He  had been suffering from pancreatic cancer  publicist Bill Carpenter told The Associated Press.
Along with Andrae Crouch  James Cleveland and a handful of others   Hawkins  was credited as a founder of modern gospel music. Aretha Franklin  Sam Cooke and numerous other singers had become mainstream stars by adapting gospel sounds to pop lyrics.  Hawkins  stood out for enjoying commercial success while still performing music that openly celebrated religious faith.
An Oakland native and one of eight siblings   Hawkins  was a composer  keyboardist  arranger and choir master.  He  had been performing with  his  family and in church groups since childhood and in  his  20s helped form the Northern California State Youth Choir.
Their first album  ""Let Us Go into the House of the Lord "" came out in 1968 and was intended for local audiences. But radio stations in the San Francisco Bay Area began playing one of the album's eight tracks  ""Oh Happy Day "" an 18th century hymn arranged by  Hawkins  in call-and-response style.
""Oh Happy Day "" featuring the vocals of Dorothy Combs Morrison  was released as a single credited to the Edwin Hawkins Singers and became a million-seller in 1969  showing there was a large market for gospel songs and for inspirational music during the turbulent era of the late 1960s.
""I think our music was probably a blend and a crossover of everything that I was hearing during that time ""  Hawkins  told blackmusic.com in 2015. ""We grew up hearing all kinds of music in our home. My mother  who was a devout Christian  loved the Lord and displayed that in her lifestyle.

Meanwhile  George Harrison would cite ""Oh Happy Day"" as inspiration for his hit ""My Sweet Lord "" and Glen Campbell reached the adult contemporary charts with his own version of the  Hawkins  performance. Elvis Presley  Johnny Mathis and numerous others also would record it.
 Hawkins  went on to make dozens of records and won four Grammys in all  including for the songs ""Every Man Wants to Be Free"" and ""Wonderful!""

Saakashvili  who was president 2004-13  left Georgia when his presidency ended and eventually went to Ukraine  where he had been appointed governor of the Odessa region. He resigned in 2016 and harshly criticized President Petro Poroshenko. The Ukrainian leader last year stripped Saakashvili of his citizenship while he was abroad;  Saakashvili  returned to Ukraine in September and has led a series of protests against the government.
A court in the Georgian capital  Tbilisi  sentenced  Saakashvili  on Friday. Georgia has requested Saakashviliâs extradition  but Ukraine has not complied.
The verdict âis completely illegal and contradicts all international  national norms and common sense â  Saakashvili  said on Facebook. âJudging  the president  for using the right to pardon  which is not limited in any way  speaks about the completely political nature of this process.â

3837,Emanuel admonishes City Council divided on health care access abortion views,Emanuel,"With  Mayor Rahm Emanuel  looking on from  his  perch at the front of council chambers  aldermen criticized and cajoled  trying to build support or stoke opposition among colleagues on the issue of giving Presence Health a $5.6 million tax subsidy to help pay for its downtown corporate headquarters.
 Emanuel   whoâs been trying to rebuild  his  standing among black voters ahead of a 2019 re-election bid  backed the tax subsidy. Even as the meeting was underway   his  aides arm-twisted aldermen  trying to keep down the number of ânoâ votes.
In the end  the mayor won  as has been the norm at City Hall in the decades since then-Mayor Richard M. Daley consolidated power on the fifth floor. But the 31-18 tally proved to be one of the closest margins  Emanuel  has faced during  his  nearly seven years as mayor  and following the roll call  he  took to the microphone and launched into an animated lecture.
Sweeping  his  arms out toward the aldermen and jabbing  his  finger on  his  desk   Emanuel  admonished those who opposed the deal for applying what  he  termed a sudden âlitmus testâ on abortion.
âWe never raised a question on (money for hospitals like) St. Anthony  Norwegian  Mercy  Swedish Covenant â said  Emanuel    his  voice rising as  he  listed earlier city financial help for private health care companies.
âNot a peep  not a sound about a litmus test â  he  added.
Still  even as  he  scolded aldermen who opposed  him    Emanuel  dedicated several minutes of  his  speech to bolstering  his  own bona fides on health care.
The mayor dipped back into his political history to mention his role as President Barack Obamaâs chief of staff in helping get the Affordable Care Act passed  though  Emanuel  had cautioned the president against pursuing what became Obamacare  warning he would lose the 2012 election if he pursued it.

 Emanuel  also touted  his  work to expand health care for children as an adviser in the Clinton White House. And  he  recalled  his  family history as the son of a pediatrician who  he  said ânever  ever turned away anyone who couldnât pay.â
In addition   the mayor  pointed to  his  own â100 percent recordâ on voting on reproductive rights while  he  was in Congress.  Emanuel  said supporting Presence wasnât an âeither-orâ vote on abortion rights but rather a question of giving people access to health care.
Ald. Ameya Pawar  however  said  Emanuel  portrayed the issue as exactly that.
The 47th Ward alderman said Emanuelâs argument that council members were hypocritical on the matter was âdisingenuous.â The other votes  the mayor  cited  Pawar said  did not involve taxpayer funding for a corporate office in the Loop. The Swedish Covenant example was not relevant because that hospital does not have the same abortion policy as Presence  the alderman added.
Asked about the relatively tight vote   Emanuel  replied that the measure âpassed by nearly 2 to 1.â
At a post-meeting news conference   Emanuel  said  he  thinks Presence opponents suddenly started complaining about the companyâs abortion policies to make political hay out of the issue in the February 2019 municipal elections  when all 50 City Council seats and the mayorâs office will be on the ballot.
Ald. Pat Dowell said she was called by Emanuel aides who tried to convince her to change her position after she voted against the subsidy at the Finance Committee meeting last week. âI was not swayed by those arguments â said the 3rd Ward alderman.","With   [TGT] looking on from   [TGT]   perch at the front of council chambers  aldermen criticized and cajoled  trying to build support or stoke opposition among colleagues on the issue of giving Presence Health a $5.6 million tax subsidy to help pay for its downtown corporate headquarters.

But the 31-18 tally proved to be one of the closest margins   [TGT] has faced during   [TGT]   nearly seven years as mayor  and following the roll call   [TGT]   took to the microphone and launched into an animated lecture.
Sweeping   [TGT]   arms out toward the aldermen and jabbing   [TGT]   finger on   [TGT]   desk    [TGT] admonished those who opposed the deal for applying what   [TGT]   termed a sudden âlitmus testâ on abortion.
âWe never raised a question on (money for hospitals like) St. Anthony  Norwegian  Mercy  Swedish Covenant â said   [TGT]  [TGT]   voice rising as   [TGT]   listed earlier city financial help for private health care companies.
âNot a peep  not a sound about a litmus test â  he  added.
Still  even as  he  scolded aldermen who opposed  him     [TGT] dedicated several minutes of   [TGT]   speech to bolstering   [TGT]   own bona fides on health care.
The mayor dipped back into his political history to mention his role as President Barack Obamaâs chief of staff in helping get the Affordable Care Act passed  though   [TGT] had cautioned the president against pursuing what became Obamacare  warning  [TGT]  would lose the 2012 election if  [TGT]  pursued it.

  [TGT] also touted   [TGT]   work to expand health care for children as an adviser in the Clinton White House. And   [TGT]   recalled   [TGT]   family history as the son of a pediatrician who   [TGT]   said ânever  ever turned away anyone who couldnât pay.â
In addition   the mayor  pointed to  his  own â100 percent recordâ on voting on reproductive rights while  he  was in Congress.   [TGT] said supporting Presence wasnât an âeither-orâ vote on abortion rights but rather a question of giving people access to health care.
Ald. Ameya Pawar  however  said   [TGT] portrayed the issue as exactly that.
The 47th Ward alderman said Emanuelâs argument that council members were hypocritical on the matter was âdisingenuous.â The other votes  the mayor  cited  Pawar said  did not involve taxpayer funding for a corporate office in the Loop. The Swedish Covenant example was not relevant because that hospital does not have the same abortion policy as Presence  the alderman added.
Asked about the relatively tight vote    [TGT] replied that the measure âpassed by nearly 2 to 1.â
At a post-meeting news conference    [TGT] said   [TGT]   thinks Presence opponents suddenly started complaining about the companyâs abortion policies to make political hay out of the issue in the February 2019 municipal elections  when all 50 City Council seats and the mayorâs office will be on the ballot.
Ald. Pat Dowell said she was called by  [TGT]  aides who tried to convince her to change her position after she voted against the subsidy at the Finance Committee meeting last week. âI was not swayed by those arguments â said the 3rd Ward alderman.",Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

As if Steelers fans didnât have enough about which to get excited Sunday  with their team hosting the Patriots in a massive AFC showdown  they were treated to an unexpected and most welcome sight:  Ryan Shazier . The injured Pittsburgh linebacker got a roar from the crowd as he made an appearance at Heinz Field.
During a stoppage in play early in the first quarter   Shazier  was shown on stadium video screens. The fourth-year player  whose career could be in jeopardy following spinal surgery earlier this month  waved a Terrible Towel from a luxury suite while remaining seated.

 Shazier  was injured while making a tackle in a Dec. 4 game at Cincinnati.  He  was initially taken to a hospital there before being transported to University of Pittsburgh Medical Center  where  he  underwent spinal stabilization surgery and where  he  has remained.
Earlier this week  UPMC released a statement saying that  Shazier  had begun rehabilitation  but little information has been made public about  his  condition. The Steelers placed the 2016 Pro Bowler on injured reserve Tuesday  ending his season  with team President Art Rooney II saying  âEven off the field  Ryan  will continue to be one of our team leaders. We know  his  spirit and positive outlook will help  him  to continue in  his  recovery  as well as serve as an inspiration to our team.â
 Shazier  is expected to require months of rehabilitation  and several teammates and coaches have said they just want to see  him  walk again. Some Pittsburgh players have been wearing cleats with the message âShalieve â and the team gave  Shazier  the game ball last week after clinching the AFC North title with a win over the Ravens.

âWeâre not done with this â  the 71-year-old Bundy  declared in his first minutes of freedom since his arrest in February 2016.
The stunning collapse of  the federal criminal case against Cliven Bundy and his sons Ryan and Ammon  marked a new low for government lawyers whose work is now under review by the Trump administration. Prosecutors have faced several losses in Oregon and Nevada arising from  armed Bundy  standoffs over federal control of vast stretches of land in the U.S. West.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions launched an investigation into  the Nevada case  last month after Chief U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro declared a mistrial. On Monday  she dismissed outright all 15 counts against  Bundy   his sons and Montana militia leader Ryan Payne.
âThe court finds that the universal sense of justice has been violated â Navarro said as audible gasps and sobs erupted in a court gallery crammed with  Bundy  supporters.
Jurors in Portland  Oregon  also acquitted Ryan and  Ammon Bundy  more than a year ago of taking over a federal wildlife refuge in early 2016 and calling for the U.S. government to turn over public land to local control.

3843,CATO: Illegal Immigrants More Likely to Commit Crimes than Ones Who Came Legally,Cato,"A report by the Cato Institute released on February 26  reveals that illegal immigrants are much more likely to commit violent crimes than immigrants who follow the law to get here. Cato primarily provides written analysis on the portion of the report showing illegal immigrants less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.
 The report by the Cato Institutesâ Alex Nowrasteh  attempts to debunk the positions of President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security that illegal immigrants are a âsignificant source of crime.â To do so  the writer analyzed reports from the Texas Department of Public Safety and looked at crime statistics for native-born Americans  legal immigrants  and illegal immigrants.
Cato chose Texas because the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) cooperates with immigration officials and therefore has more accurate breakdowns of crimes and arrests by immigration/citizenship status  the report states. While  the report  seeks to paint a picture that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans  it also shows that people who come to the U.S. by illegally entering the country in violation of laws are much more likely to commit additional crimes than people who immigrate here by following the law.
 The report  looks at Texas DPS crime statistics for 2015.
For example  Catoâs charts show that illegal immigrants are nearly 300 percent more likely to be convicted of a crime in Texas than a legal immigrant. Compared to native-born Americans  illegal immigrants are convicted at less than half the rate.
Illegal immigrants led the other categories in four types of crimes in Texas â gambling  kidnapping  smuggling  and vagrancy â Cato states. However  these cases are small in number and account for 0.18 percent of all criminal convictions in the Lone Star State.
In terms of arrests for various crimes  Cato reports similar numbers. Illegal immigrants are about 300 percent more likely than legal immigrants to be arrested on any criminal charge  but are 40 percent less likely than the numbers of native-born Americans arrested. Similar rates apply for arrests for homicide  but illegal immigrants are more likely than native-born Americans to be arrested for sexual assault â but not for convictions for the alleged assaults.
 Catoâs  conclusion:
 Catoâs  conclusion and analysis throughout point out the comparison between crimes committed by native-born Americans and illegal immigrants and the comparison of crimes by legal immigrants versus native-born Americans. However  Cato appears to ignore the comparison of crimes committed by illegal immigrants who come to the U.S. with an initial mindset of violating immigration law versus legal immigrants who follow U.S. immigration law to move to this country. While the facts are shown in the charts  the written analysis does not make reference to comparisons between legal and illegal immigrants.","[TGT] reveals that illegal immigrants are much more likely to commit violent crimes than immigrants who follow the law to get here.

3846,Here Are the Four Things a Democratic Presidential Candidate Will Need to Beat Trump in 2020,George W. Bush,"Then  we have to keep in mind that Democrats underestimate successful Republicans at their own peril. Nobody thought  George W. Bush  could ever become governor of Texas. Then  he  beat Ann Richards â a cult figure in the state â by 8 points. When  he  won  his  re-election as governor   Bush  got an astounding 69 percent of the vote.  Al Gore  was a virtual shoe-in to win the presidency in 2000. A two-term vice president who inherited a healthy economy   Gore  then lost in a head-to-head race with  Bush . For four straight years  Democrats mocked  him  as an inarticulate fool. With  his  approval rating tanking as the Iraq War became an obvious quagmire   Bush  still won re-election against then-Sen. John Kerry. Say what you want   George W. Bush  was a nearly unbeatable politician.
Trump is a Godzilla of a political opponent.  He  wields  his  46.5 million Twitter followers  23 million Facebook followers  and 8.2 million Instagram followers to not just dominate and shape every single news cycle  but to mock and ridicule  his  opponents.  He  has a media machine â Fox News  Breitbart  and increasingly places like the Wall Street Journal â that are more than willing to amplify  his  message. And  at the receiving end  there are millions of people who will believe  him  and vote for  him .
 He  literally told over 2 000 lies in  his  first year in office yet consistently goes on about âfake news.â On Wednesday   he  had the gall to say  he  wished the United States had tougher libel laws to hold people accountable for their dishonest attacks.
Trump won 30 different states in the 2016 general election. Sixty-three million people voted for  him . Even though  he  was the least popular presidential candidate in the history of modern politics   he  won.  He âs now the president of the United States. And  he  got there even after more than a dozen women came forward to say  he  sexually assaulted or harassed them. Trump was elected even after a recording was released of  him  admitting  he  sexually assaults women.  He  was elected even after mocking Sen. John McCain  R-Ariz.  for being a prisoner of war.  He  was elected even after blaming the questioning  he  received from a debate moderator on  her  menstrual cycle.  He  was elected even after allegations circulated that  he  brutally raped and assaulted  his  first wife in a rage after a scalp reduction surgery. Even after the Ku Klux Klan endorsed  him  and Neo-Nazis openly attended  his  campaign events  Trump won.
 He  is formidable. Ask Jeb Bush. Ask Hillary Clinton. Their political careers are over. When Trump beats you in a head-to-head match-up  itâs hard to recover.
If Trump werenât the opponent  a traditional Democratic primary  full of governors most of the nation has never heard of and senators they are likely tired of  might produce a candidate who could defeat the Republican incumbent. Even against Trump  itâs still possible that a traditional Democrat â an upstart in the party  or even an established member â could slog their way through a tough primary  capture the nationâs attention  rise up  and beat  him .
But going against the presidentâs massive online influence and the right-wing media machine that allows  him  to dictate so much coverage is far more difficult than it appears. As a result  there are only a few particular people who I believe can easily defeat Trump in a presidential election  who could enter the race with a good fighting chance.","Then  we have to keep in mind that Democrats underestimate successful Republicans at their own peril. Nobody thought   [TGT] could ever become governor of Texas. Then   [TGT]   beat Ann Richards â a cult figure in the state â by 8 points. When  he  won  his  re-election as governor    [TGT] got an astounding 69 percent of the vote.  Al Gore  was a virtual shoe-in to win the presidency in 2000. A two-term vice president who inherited a healthy economy   Gore  then lost in a head-to-head race with  [TGT]  . For four straight years  Democrats mocked  him  as an inarticulate fool. With  his  approval rating tanking as the Iraq War became an obvious quagmire    [TGT] still won re-election against then-Sen. John Kerry. Say  [TGT] was a nearly unbeatable politician.

3849,Biden: McConnell Refused To Sign Bipartisan Statement On Russian Interference : The Two,Joe Biden,"Former Vice President Joe Biden  says  he  and President Obama decided not to speak out publicly on Russian interference during the 2016 campaign after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to sign a bipartisan statement condemning the Kremlin's role.
Speaking on Tuesday at the Council on Foreign Relations   Biden  said the Obama administration sought a united front to dispel concerns that going public with such accusations would be seen as an effort to undermine the legitimacy of the election.
At that point   Biden  added  he felt that ""the die had been cast"" and that ""this was all about the political play.""

""Would things have gotten better  or would it further look like we were trying to delegitimize the electoral process  because of our opponent?""

In an interview with NPR in November   Biden  was asked by Morning Edition's Rachel Martin if  he  thought Russia had interfered in the election. ""I don't think. I know they did ""  Biden  replied.

3852,Families Search for Justice for Loved Ones Killed in Collapsed Buildings in Mexico City Earthquake,Fernando SÃ¡nchez,"In 1985  when  Fernando SÃ¡nchez  was 18 years old   he  dug through rubble in search of life at the site of a collapsed factory in the center of Mexico City. An unknown number of garment workers  mostly women  lost their lives in that factory following the 8.0 magnitude earthquake  and  SÃ¡nchez  was among the rescue crew that tried to save them.
Thirty-two years and approximately six hours later  a 7.1 earthquake shook Mexicoâs core again  and  SÃ¡nchez  found  himself  at the site of another collapsed garment factory  a few blocks away from the building that fell in 1985. This time   he  arrived as a desperate family member  searching for  his  70-year-old mother  Maria Teresa Lira Infante  and  his  sister  Maria Elena SÃ¡nchez Lira  aged 55  who labored in a dress-beading workshop inside.
âFrom a distance  [I] saw that a building had collapsed and prayed to all the forces in the universe that it wasnât theirs â  SÃ¡nchez  told The Intercept. âAs I got closer  I saw that it was their building and just hoped that they had gotten out in time.â
The four-story building at 168 Bolivar St. on the corner of Chimalpopoca â which became known in the news and on social media just as Chimalpopoca â had converted within seconds into a pile of concrete rubble. Neighbors and volunteers arrived on the scene  hoping to rescue those trapped within  but they lacked basic tools. At first   SÃ¡nchez  was immobilized by his concern for his family  but talking with other relatives  he snapped to. He couldnât dig into the concrete due to a previous injury  so he started mobilizing help via social networks  publishing lists of items that the volunteers needed â flood lights  cranes  power cutters â long before official rescue workers arrived on the site.
The day went on  and  SÃ¡nchez  still had no news of  his  mother and sister. Close to midnight  another of  his  sisters showed  him  blurry cellphone photos of bodies in a local morgue. Police had refused to let  his  sister inside  but offered to take photos of the bodies that had come in. She didnât recognize any of them  but  SÃ¡nchez  did.  He  lived with  his  mother  and that morning   he  had helped fasten her watch on her wrist before she took the subway to work â and  he  saw the watch in the photos from the morgue. When  he  went to claim the body   he  wiped the dust that covered  his  motherâs face  closed her eyes  and hugged her for the last time.
âMy heart was shredded to pieces â said  SÃ¡nchez . âI never imagined that she would die like this.â
Mexicoâs Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare has confirmed that the Chimalpopoca building contained five different companies  including SEO Young  the textile company where the SÃ¡nchez women worked. SEO Young also runs workshops in a building about a block away  at 185 Isabel La CatÃ³lica.  Fernando SÃ¡nchez  told The Intercept that  his  mother and sister had previously been at the location on Isabel La CatÃ³lica but switched to Chimalpopoca because the company told them the building was not structurally sound.
âThat building is standing  and they switched to one that collapsed â  SÃ¡nchez  said  shaking his head.
âWho authorized them to place that antenna and the electric substation there?â asked  SÃ¡nchez . âI am convinced that they caused the building to collapse.â Various Mexican media outlets have reported that the antenna weighed over 40 tons  based on an estimation given by one of the rescue workers who removed it with a crane.
According to the Mexican government  15 people died in the collapse at Chimalpopoca. Along with SÃ¡nchezâs mother and sister  other employees for SEO Young also died  including a mother and her daughter-in-law and a young woman who had just returned from pregnancy leave.  SÃ¡nchez  says that SEO Young offered $18 000 in total for all the families of the deceased.
âI donât want to put a price on the life of my mother  but that is not a dignified amount â it is actually offensive â said  SÃ¡nchez .  He  refused to accept the money and says  he  will demand just compensation through legal means. Immediately   he  faces the cost of two funerals  about $1 700. The government has promised to reimburse various fees related to the earthquake  but the process had been slow.
 SÃ¡nchez  used to enjoy cooking and hanging out with  his  mom. Now living alone   he  spends all  his  time visiting one government office after another  completing bureaucratic processes and hoping that a government investigation will find those culpable for  his  mother and sisterâs death.
âI now have to reinvent my life from nothing without them â said  SÃ¡nchez . âI just want justice  there is someone responsible for the collapse of that building.â","In 1985  when   [TGT] was 18 years old    [TGT]   dug through rubble in search of life at the site of a collapsed factory in the center of Mexico City.

3853,10 Things We Learned From 'Eric Clapton : Life in 12 Bars' Doc,Eric Clapton,"Lili Fini Zanuck's documentary Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars follows the guitarist as he pursues a single-minded mission to raise the profile of the blues in popular culture. During the Sixties  he moved through bands at a reckless pace in search for the right combination of blues aficionados â he joined  scored major hits and then left and/or dissolved the Yardbirds  John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers  Cream  Blind Faith and Derek the Dominos in less than a decade. Collaborators were just a means to an end;  Clapton 's commitment to the form was total.
Related Toronto 2017:  Clapton   Gaga Music Docs Have Strong Premieres at Fest 'A Life in 12 Bars' closes the book on Slowhand's career  while 'Gaga: Five Feet Two' documents the singer catching a second wind
Life in 12 Bars also grounds  Clapton 's drive in an early childhood trauma: His mother left him to be raised by his grandparents  a rejection that would haunt his subsequent romantic difficulties and decades-long struggles with substance addiction. The documentary is relatively low on talking heads  preferring voiceover narration from  Clapton  or old video footage: Cream wreaking havoc during a live performance in the U.S.; home-movie footage of the musician and his friends goofing around during the recording sessions for what would become Derek and the Dominos' one hit album;  Clapton  struggling to maintain equilibrium during a drunken show in the 1970s; and then playing songs from  his  triumphant  Grammy-winning MTV Unplugged album in the 1990s.
It's  Clapton 's steadfast interest in the blues  however  that serves as the film's through-line. ""When it came to blues  there was no one like him "" says Mayall. And the doc  which makes its broadcast premiere on Showtime on February 10th  makes a strong case for why that music has kept him going through highs  lows  good times and some seriously bad times. Here are 10 more takeaways from the movie.
 Clapton  was raised by his grandparents and ""was a bit of a loner at times "" says his grandma. But he found solace in the BBC children's show Uncle Mac. ""Uncle Mac was on the radio Saturday morning  and he would play a variety of music for kids ""  Clapton  remembers. ""And then every now and then  he'd play some different music: [the blues]. You didn't hear that anywhere else. And I thought  this is for me â¦ it took all the pain away.""
But it brought some pain to those around him when he bought a guitar and practiced at home at all hours. ""I used to suffer agony at night ""  Clapton 's grandmother remembers. ""Three in the morning  he'd be up playing Big Bill Broonzy.""
In 1964   Clapton  played a Christmas event with the Yardbirds. The Beatles were also on the bill  and seeing them had a profound effect on  Clapton . ""When the Beatles came on  [the fans] would just start screaming so you couldn't hear anything "" he explains. ""We would watch from the wings and I could see how pointless these guys thought it was already. George was clearly an innovator. But the sad part was that no one listened.""
He thought he was safe in his band â which turned out not to be the case. ""I thought the Yardbirds had a real understanding about what it was all about  and it wasn't about being famous or getting on TV or having a hit "" he says. But then came ""For Your Love "" a hit for the group in 1965. ""It was pop!""  Clapton  exclaims. ""All the material that we were doing was blues music that hadn't even filtered through to the mainstream yet. We were pioneering something. I noticed they were deliberately growing Beatles' haircuts. I thought  we sold out. I've sold out  I gotta get out of here."" He left the group high and dry with a major hit to promote and no lead guitarist to play it.
3.  Clapton 's influences extend outside of guitarists.
Though he's known for six-string wizardry   Clapton  looked to other instruments for inspiration. ""I listened to [the Indian musician] Bismillah Khan a lot "" he says. ""I wanted my guitar to sound like his reed instrument. One of the biggest influences on what I wanted to achieve with the guitar was Little Walter  the sound he made with the harmonica playing through an amplifier. It was thick and fat and very melodic.""
When  Clapton  went into the studio to record as a member of John Mayall's group  he was frustrated by technicians ""that just came up to your amp with the microphone and just stuck it two inches away from the front of the amplifier "" he says. ""It seemed to me that if you wanted to get the atmosphere we were getting in the clubs  you needed it to sound like you were in the audience 10 feet away  not three inches.""
 Clapton  moved the mics â and aspiring musicians took notice. ""That changed everything "" Roger Waters says. ""Before Eric  guitar playing in England had been Hank Marvin of the Shadows  very simple  not much technique. Suddenly we heard something completely different. The records sounded unlike anything we had heard before.""
Clapton and his new band went to Miami to record Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs  working in the legendary Criterion Studios with the Atlantic engineer Tom Dowd. But despite a talented group and sunny weather  ""two weeks into the session  we got stuck ""  Clapton  says. ""We hit a brick wall.""
Dowd took the outfit to see the Allman Brothers  and the performance had a galvanizing effect. ""I was completely blown away by this band ""  Clapton  remembers.  He  also struck up a friendship with Allman  who joined  Clapton  and co. in the studio. "" He  was the catalyst we needed ""  Clapton  adds.

9.  Clapton 's drug and alcohol addictions worsened after the death of  his  grandfather.","Lili Fini Zanuck's documentary  [TGT] : Life in 12 Bars follows the guitarist as he pursues a single-minded mission to raise the profile of the blues in popular culture. During the Sixties  he moved through bands at a reckless pace in search for the right combination of blues aficionados â he joined  scored major hits and then left and/or dissolved the Yardbirds  John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers  Cream  Blind Faith and Derek the Dominos in less than a decade. Collaborators were just a means to an end;  Clapton 's commitment to the form was total.

Life in 12 Bars also grounds  Clapton 's drive in an early childhood trauma: His mother left him to be raised by his grandparents  a rejection that would haunt his subsequent romantic difficulties and decades-long struggles with substance addiction. The documentary is relatively low on talking heads  preferring voiceover narration from  Clapton  or old video footage: Cream wreaking havoc during a live performance in the U.S.; home-movie footage of the musician and his friends goofing around during the recording sessions for what would become Derek and the Dominos' one hit album;  Clapton  struggling to maintain equilibrium during a drunken show in the 1970s; and then playing songs from  his  triumphant  Grammy-winning MTV Unplugged album in the 1990s.
It's  Clapton 's steadfast interest in the blues  however  that serves as the film's through-line. ""When it came to blues  there was no one like him "" says Mayall. And the doc  which makes its broadcast premiere on Showtime on February 10th  makes a strong case for why that music has kept him going through highs  lows  good times and some seriously bad times. Here are 10 more takeaways from the movie.
 Clapton  was raised by his grandparents and ""was a bit of a loner at times "" says his grandma. But he found solace in the BBC children's show Uncle Mac. ""Uncle Mac was on the radio Saturday morning  and he would play a variety of music for kids ""  Clapton  remembers. ""And then every now and then  he'd play some different music: [the blues]. You didn't hear that anywhere else. And I thought  this is for me â¦ it took all the pain away.""

3860,Australian court rules deputy PM ineligible for parliament government loses majority,Barnaby Joyce,"CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australiaâs High Court ruled on Friday that  Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce  is ineligible to remain in parliament  a stunning decision that cost the government its one-seat parliamentary majority and forced a by-election.

Turnbullâs center-right coalition is now in a precarious position. His Liberal Party is the senior party in a coalition with the smaller National Party  which  Joyce  led.
The opposition Labor Party immediately went on the attack and threatened to launch a legal challenge to every decision made by  Joyce  since last yearâs election.
 Joyce  was one of a group of lawmakers  known as the âCitizenship Sevenâ  whose eligibility to sit in parliament was thrown into doubt in recent months when it was found they were dual citizens  a status that is barred for politicians under Australiaâs constitution to prevent split allegiances. [nL4N1ML1LH]
Turnbull is under added pressure because he refused to force  Joyce  to step aside while his case was considered by the High Court.  Joyce   whose New England electorate is in rural New South Wales state  renounced  his  dual New Zealand citizenship in August. [nS9N1I700B]

3861,Review: âThe New Testament: A Translation â by David Bentley Hart,David Bentley Hart,"Reviews The New Testament: A Translation By David Bentley Hart Yale University Press
In the beginning was â¦ well  what? A clap of the divine hands and a poetic shock wave? Or an itchy node of nothingness inconceivably scratching itself into somethingness? In the beginning was the Word  says the Gospel according to Johnâa lovely statement of the case  as itâs always seemed to me. A pre-temporal syllable swelling to utterance in the mouth of the universe  spoken once and heard forever: Godâs power chord  if you like. For  David Bentley Hart   however  whose mind-bending translation of the New Testament was published in October  the Wordâas a wordâdoes not suffice:  He  finds it to be âa curiously bland and impenetrable designationâ for the heady concept expressed in the original Greek of the Gospels as Logos. The Chinese word Tao might get at it   Hart  tells us  but English has nothing with quite the metaphysical flavor of Logos  the particular sense of a formative moral energy diffusing itself  without diminution  through space and time. So  he  throws up  his  hands and leaves it where it is: âIn the origin there was the Logos â¦â
Itâs significant  this act of lexical surrender  because if youâd bet on anyone to come up with a fancy English word for Logos  itâd be  David Bentley Hart . Vocabulary is not  his  problem  unless you think  he  has too much of it. A scholar  theologian  and cultural commentator   Hart  is also a stylist; or rather  the prickly and slightly preening polemical exhibition that is  his  style is indivisible from  his  role as a scholarly and theologically oriented cultural commentator. Like G. K. Chesterton  he has one essential argument: that God is the foundation of our being and that every human life therefore has its beginning and its end in eternity. He rehearses this argument in numberless witty variations against whichever non-God ideology happens to slouch beneath his pen: materialism  scientism  consumerism  pornographism â¦ And he can sound a Chestertonian note. âMy chief purpose â he wrote in 2013âs The Experience of God  âis not to advise atheists on what I think they should believe; I want merely to make sure that they have a clear concept of what it is they claim not to believe.â
Letâs zoom in on Mark  the roughest and tersest of the Gospels. (Hippolytus of Rome  in the third century  called Mark âstump fingeredââpossibly a physical descriptor but more likely  I think  a comment on his prose.) Hereâs how Monsignor Ronald Knox handled Mark 1:40â41 in his 1945 translation: âThen a leper came up to him  asking for his aid; he knelt at his feet and said  If it be thy will  thou hast power to make me clean. Jesus was moved with pity; he held out his hand and touched him  and said  It is my will; be thou made clean.â  Hart âs version: âAnd a leper comes to him  imploring him and falling to his knees  saying to him  âIf you wish it  you are able to cleanse me.â And  moved inwardly with compassion  he stretched out his hand and touched him  and says to him  âI wish it  be clean.â â Thereâs a stumbling  almost rustically blundering urgency to this  the verb tenses tripping over one another; beside it the Knox translation feels smoothed out  falsely archaized  too rhetorical. In  Hart  we can hear more clearly both the leperâs challengeâheal me!âand the quickness and intimacy of Jesusâs response.","Reviews The New Testament: A Translation By David Bentley Hart Yale University Press

3862,Daniel Ellsberg Explains Why He Leaked The Pentagon Papers : NPR,Daniel Ellsberg,"Daniel Ellsberg  Explains Why  He  Leaked The Pentagon Papers
In 1971   Ellsberg  leaked the Pentagon Papers to the press in the hope that they would help end the Vietnam War.  His  story is portrayed in the new film The Post. Originally broadcast Dec. 4  2017.
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies  in for Terry Gross.  Our next guest  Daniel Ellsberg   became one of the best-known opponents of the Vietnam War in 1971 when  he  leaked a secret Defense Department study of the war that came to be known as the Pentagon Papers to the country's leading newspapers. That story is the basis for the new film ""The Post"" starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep. In this scene  Washington Post editor Ben Bagdikian is meeting  Ellsberg   who's hiding out in a motel  eluding an FBI manhunt. Piles of papers are spread out over the two beds in the room. Matthew Rhys plays  Ellsberg . Bob Odenkirk plays Bagdikian.
MATTHEW RHYS: (As Daniel Ellsberg) Ben.
RHYS: (As Daniel Ellsberg) The study had 47 volumes. I slipped out a couple at a time - took me months to copy it all.
RHYS: (As Daniel Ellsberg) Well  we were all former government guys - top clearance - all that. McNamara wanted academics to have the chance to examine what had happened. He would say to us  let the chips fall where they may.
RHYS: (As Daniel Ellsberg) Well  I think guilt was a bigger motivator than courage. McNamara lies as well as the rest  but I don't think he saw what was coming  what we'd find. But it didn't take him long to figure out - well  for us all to figure out. If the public ever saw these papers  they would turn against the war. Covert ops  guaranteed debt  rigged elections - it's all in there. Ike  Kennedy  Johnson. They violated the Geneva Convention. They lied to Congress  and they lied to the public. They knew we couldn't win and still sent boys to die.
DAVIES:  Daniel Ellsberg   now 86  has a new book about  his  days before the Vietnam War when  he  worked on American nuclear war strategies in the late '50s and early '60s.  Ellsberg  was appalled by much of what  he  found and wishes  he 'd been able to leak those plans along with the Pentagon Papers.  His  book is called ""The Doomsday Machine.""
DAVIES: Well   Daniel Ellsberg   welcome to FRESH AIR. You became famous for leaking the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times and other publications. And you tell us at the beginning of this book that you copied not just the Vietnam study but a lot of other material from your safe at the RAND Corporation about U.S. nuclear war plans. What were you going to do with that material?
DAVIES: My guest is  Daniel Ellsberg .  His  new book is ""The Doomsday Machine."" We'll continue our conversation after just a short break. This is FRESH AIR.
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR  and we're speaking with  Daniel Ellsberg . You'll remember that  he  leaked the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times and other publications.  He  has a new book called ""The Doomsday Machine: Confessions Of A Nuclear War Planner"" about  his  early days doing nuclear war planning for the Air Force.
 ELLSBERG : Pardon me. I think I'm going to make it clear  but I wouldn't even want the question - to raise that question  in a way. I am a patriot  and that has never changed.
 ELLSBERG : Without young men going to prison for nonviolent protests against the draft  men that I met on their way to prison  no Pentagon Papers. It wouldn't have occurred to  me  simply to do something that would put  myself  in prison for the rest of my life  as I assumed that would do. So  obviously  that was not an obvious decision to make  except once I'd seen the example of people like Randy Kehler and Bob Eaton and others and David Harris  who did go to prison to say that this war was wrong - the Vietnam War was wrong - and that they refused to participate in it.
 ELLSBERG : Well  in those days  it was one page at a time. We didn't have these zip  zip  multi-page collators and whatnot machines that they have now or the - of course  the digital capability. So it took me a long time - months  actually.
 ELLSBERG : Yes.
 ELLSBERG : Well  twice in that office  which was a small advertising office owned by a friend of a friend  really - twice during that period  police came to the door because she had turned the key the wrong way and set off the burglar alarm. And on one of those occasions  my children were there. That was the one time. Police came in and found my son running the Xerox machine.","[TGT] Explains Why   [TGT]   Leaked The Pentagon Papers

3864,Landon Collins suddenly vouching for teammate Eli Apple,Landon Collins,"ATLANTA â Landon Collins  wants  his  troubled teammate back  but prefers to pass on the legendary head coach.
The Giantsâ Pro Bowl safety  in attendance for Monday nightâs national championship game between Alabama   his  alma mater  and Georgia  voiced support for maligned cornerback Eli Apple.  He   however  doesnât want to see Patriots coach Bill Belichick return to East Rutherford as had been rumored as a possibility in the wake of an ESPN story that detailed friction among Belichick  quarterback Tom Brady and owner Robert Kraft.
âMy relationship can be repaired with  him  â  Collins  said of Apple  with whom  he  feuded through the media this season. âOur relationship can be mended. I donât know what  his  mindset is right now.  He âs kind of all over the place right now. You can see that with  his  Twitter rant. We got to have an understanding why  he âs playing football  because you got to be playing football to be one of the best players  not to be on the team and blowing your opportunity.â
Apple struggled mightily in his second season  appearing in only 11 games. He was inactive for a four-game stretch late in the year and suspended for the final game of the season. He clashed with Collins  who called him a âcancerâ after Apple indirectly called  Collins  a liar when the safety said he was trying to help him through his struggles. Apple has recently been spending time on Twitter going at critical Giants fans.
 Collins  told The Post  he  and Apple havenât spoken since having a sit-down with interim coach Steve Spagnuolo the final week of the regular season  and wouldnât say whether either apologized to the other  wanting to keep the conversation private. But  he  plans to reach out to  him  soon  and spend time with  him  in the offseason.  He  believes Apple will be back with the Giants despite the myriad issues  he  dealt with and created this season.
âI think the organization should keep  him  â  Collins  said. â He âs a first-rounder.  He  does a good job when  his  head is on straight on the field. â¦ I want  him  to be here. I want  him  to be under my wing  and I can continue pushing  him   continuing teaching  him  how this game is and how this business goes  and help  him  grow up as much as I can.â
As for Belichick  the five-time Super Bowl-winning coach who said on Monday  he  âabsolutelyâ plans to stay with the Patriots   Collins  said Belichick is too similar to  his  college coach  Nick Saban  for his taste. He credited Sabanâs rigid style with getting him to the NFL  but itâs not something he wants to live through again.
âThe way he runs his organization  Iâve been through that process. I donât like it â  Collins  said. âItâs too strict. â¦. Heâs a great winner  heâs a great coach. I donât know if [his style] is what the organization really wants.
 Collins  doesnât have a specific choice for whom  he  wants the Giants to hire.  He  has yet to meet with new general manager Dave Gettleman  but plans to do so this week once  he  returns to New Jersey.  He âs been impressed so far by the new boss  who fired vice president of player evaluation Marc Ross and cut right tackle Bobby Hart the day before the regular-season finale.
â He âs sticking to  his  word  what  his  words were? âKicking ass ââ  Collins  said. âIâm happy about that. I like that  he âs enforcing what  he  said  he  was going to do.

""I know that we all share the same resolve to do whatever it takes to avert such tragedies here and elsewhere . . . The survivors' accounts are horrific. They are tragic  heartbreaking  and personally gut-wrenching.""
Brian Breslin  chairman of the school's board of trustees  said Wednesday evening the board would accept  Simon 's resignation.
""We agree with  Dr. Simon  that it is now time for change "" Breslin said. "" President Simon  has served with distinction as MSU's president for 13 years and has been a constant presence at the university for more than 40 years.  She  literally has devoted  her  entire professional life to this institution  and more than anyone else has helped make MSU a national and international leader in higher education.""
 Simon 's success as a leader had earned  her  support from the board of trustees  most of whom stood by  her  during the Nassar scandal  and from many faculty members  who cautioned against a rush to judgment in the court of public opinion.
On Wednesday evening  both U.S. senators from Michigan  Debbie Stabenow  D  and Gary Peters  D  called for  Simon 's resignation. ""It has become clear that the leadership at Michigan State University has failed to adequately prevent  address or respond to the victimization of young women and girls on its campus  and the crisis at MSU continues despite today's verdict "" Peters wrote in a statement.
Michigan's state House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a measure Wednesday calling for  Simon 's removal. State Rep. Adam Zemke  D-Ann Arbor  said  Simon  was responsible ""for perpetuating a sick culture that allowed a predator to continue molesting new young women and girls while also forcing  his  past victims to endure their suffering in silence. Her blatant failure to protect students from Nassar's abuse proves that she is unfit to continue as president of the university . . .  Simon  must go.""
Hundreds of students had said they would march to the administration building Friday to demand  Simon 's resignation. Last week  a unanimous vote by the Associated Students of Michigan State University condemned the board of trustees and administration for their handling of sexual assault  saying the institution's leaders had failed them  and that change in leadership was necessary.
The student-body president  Lorenzo Santavicca  thanked  Simon  on Wednesday night for her tireless leadership  saying it was clear Michigan State had increased its global leadership  but that the institution needed to ""look outward  say we're sorry  and mean it."" He said university leaders need to empathize and ask how to move forward  and that a smooth transition will be crucial  with a new president assuring the campus community of an ability to listen.
Some professors had defended  Simon   saying  she  was well-respected at the university  that  she  could not have been expected to have known about the abuses  and that they trusted  her  to implement changes needed to ensure a safe and respectful environment on campus in the future.
 Simon  is a Spartan to the core  several faculty members said:  She  earned  her  doctorate at Michigan State in 1974 and held a variety of positions at the university  including provost  before being named president in 2005.
 Simon  said in  her  resignation letter  she  limited  her  personal remarks to keep the focus on ""Team MSU "" but finished with an intimate farewell.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Saudi Arabiaâs King Salman for talks at the Kremlin on Thursday  cementing a relationship that is pivotal for world oil prices and could decide the outcome of the conflict in Syria.
 King Salman  the first sitting Saudi monarch ever to visit Russia   led a delegation to Moscow that agreed joint investment deals worth several billion dollars  providing much-needed investment for a Russian economy battered by low oil prices and Western sanctions.
On his journey into central Moscow from Vnukovo airport late on Wednesday   King Salmanâs limousine  passed billboards bearing  his  photograph and messages in Russian and Arabic welcoming  him .
âI am sure that your visit will provide a good impulse for the development of relations between our two states â Putin told  King Salman  later as they sat alongside each other in the Kremlinâs lavishly-decorated Green Parlour.
 The Saudi king  invited Putin to visit  his  country - an offer the Russian leader accepted - and said they planned to keep cooperating to keep world oil prices stable.

3868,Trump tweet about CNN âfake newsâ is itself fake news and still uncorrected â ThinkProgress,Colton Haab,"Last weekâs CNN town hall on gun violence featured strong calls for action from survivors of the Parkland shooting  a combative NRA spokesperson  and a nervous Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL). It did not feature Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student   Colton Haab   who had been set to attend the town hall.
The reason why  Haab  wasnât there  according to what  Haab  told media in the days after the town hall  was because CNN tried to tell  him  what to say. But this argument fell apart on Tuesday after Haabâs father Glenn admitted he had doctored an email exchange with CNN which made it look as though CNN was directing what Colton could say at the town hall. This caused even Fox News to admit  grudgingly  that the Haabsâ initial claims were suspect and there was no evidence CNN tried to give him a scripted question.
 Colton Haab  was reportedly one of several JROTC students who helped protect dozens of classmates by hiding them in a JROTC classroom.  He  spoke about this to outlets such as Fox & Friends  and advocated arming trained teachers in schools.
CNN reached out to  Haab  about participating in the town hall  but  he  told the local ABC affiliate the day of the event that  he  refused to attend because âCNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions and it ended up being all scripted.â  He  showed two pieces of paper with the speech  he  had initially emailed to CNN  along with several questions.
 Haab  went on Tucker Carlsonâs Fox News program the following evening  and said first someone from CNN asked for a speech  and then asked for âmore questionsâ which  Haab  said  he  was fine with. Then  he  told Carlson  the day of the event  CNN âhad taken what I had wrote  and what I had briefed on and talked about  and they actually wrote the question for  me .â  He  said  he  believed that CNN had supplied other students who participated in the event with questions  and that  he  found the whole thing âshockingâ and âupsetting.â
On Tuesday  Haabâs father  who had helped facilitate his sonâs communications with CNN  admitted that he had doctored an email sent to media to push the claim that CNN had told  Colton  what to say. He said he omitted some words  but did not do it on purpose  according to the AP. Both versions of the exchange have CNN asking Glenn Haab to make  Colton âs questions shorter âso that we can get to as many people as possible.â Then the key sentence: âThis is what  Colton  and I discussed on the phone that he submitted.â The version of the exchange  Glenn Colton  circulated to media after the event omitted the words âthat he submitted.â
Though  Glenn Colton  said  he  did not omit the words on purpose and âthere was nothing malicious behind it â the omission changed the basis of the conservative mediaâs freakout enough that  even Foxâs Tucker Carlson  who had Colton Haab on his show the day after the town hall to make these claims  issued a brief correction on his Tuesday show.
  Carlson  reviewed the story  said that CNN and the Haabs had shared the differing emails with Fox the day after the Haab interview  and that the Haabs âsaid they were being slandered by CNN and that is where it stood  two sides telling contradictory storiesâ¦â

 Burger King  has a new burger -- the Double Quarter Pound King Sandwich. (Photo:  Burger King )
In an effort to go after rival McDonald's   Burger King  is has unveiled a hefty new burger made with a half-pound of beef  which went on sale Thursday.
 Burger King 's version will consists of two beef patties with American cheese  sliced onions  pickles and ketchup on a toasted  sesame seed bun.
Unlike the Double Whopper   the new Double Quarter Pound King  has no lettuce  tomato or mayonnaise  but it does have two slices of cheese  according to the company.  The new burger  also has 60% more beef than the old Big King burger.
So far   Burger King  isn't disclosing the calorie or fat count for  its  new King on  its  website  but a Double Whopper comes 980 calories and 64 grams of fat  or almost half the 2 000 daily recommended calorie intake for adults.  The chain's most caloric burger  is  the Bacon King  at 1 150.
But one thing is clear   the new King burger  could be a profit driver in the fast-food wars. At a recommended price of $5.39   it  stands in contrast to the spate of cheaper burger choices showing up on menu boards.
Plus  in true  Burger King  fashion  executives are using the new sandwich to take potshots at the competition.
""Weâd like to offer our deepest condolences to all the flat-top fried double quarter pound burgers out there. Weâre flame grilling the competition ""  Burger King  said in a statement.
This isn't the first time  Burger King  has trolled McDonald's. An ad at Halloween time featured a scary version of Ronald McDonald made up to resemble Pennywise from the horror movie It  based on the Stephen King book. The tagline was ""Come as a clown  eat like a king.""

Burger King's sales grew 3.6%  owner Restaurant Brands International said in its third-quarter earnings report. McDonald's has been making strides in 2017 with the introduction of the upscale Signature Crafted Recipes sandwich line  the hand-crafted McCafe beverages and the new $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu.
 Burger King  was founded in 1954 and today is the world's second-largest fast-food burger chain with more than 15 000 locations around the globe  according to the company.

 Elias  quickly identified loopholes in campaign finance law that would maximize the utility of an array of pro-Clinton super PACsâgroups with which the campaign was  in most instances  legally barred from coordinating. One of  his  ideas was unprecedented in both its audacity and legal ingenuity.
â  Elias  quickly identified loopholes in campaign finance law that would maximize the utility of an array of pro-Clinton super PACsâgroups with which the campaign was  in most instances  legally barred from coordinating. One of  his  ideas was unprecedented in both its audacity and legal ingenuity. â
CTRâs activity was limited solely to producing online content. Its staffers were not compensated by any other political entity and it was offered that content for free. As a result   Elias  reasoned in a memo  âNone of CTRâs planned communications are âpublic communicationsââ as defined under the FECâs 2006 rule.
âThat is significant  because the FECâs coordination restrictions apply only to âpublic communicationsâ and do not cover other types of communications â  Elias  added. âAccordingly  CTR may disseminate these communications in coordination with the campaign without making an impermissible in-kind contribution.â

In that case   Elias  convinced the commission to exempt Google from disclosure rules as long as the pages to which its ads redirected did disclose who was behind them.","In the months after Hillary Clinton declared her 2016 presidential candidacy  her legal team began devising ways to maximize big-money support for her campaign.

3871,Reid Democrats trigger ânuclearâ option; eliminate most filibusters on nominees,Harry M. Reid,"The main combatants Thursday were the chamberâs two chiefs  Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  who have clashed for several years over Republican filibusters of Obamaâs agenda and nominees.
Previous majorities had threatened to upend filibuster rules in this manner  but relying on a simple majority vote had been used only for relatively minor procedural changes to how amendments were handled  never to eliminate the superÂ­majority requirement altogether. Before Thursday  the standard precedent was that major rule changes needed a two-thirds majority. The change was so significant that  Reid  and  his  leadership team held a victory party with liberal activists afterward in a room just off the Senate floor.
After the vote   Reid  told reporters that  his  views on the issue had evolved â from eight years ago  when Republicans held the majority and  he  led the fight to protect the filibuster.  He  acknowledged that  he  wouldnât mind seeing the supermajority requirement abolished for everything but that there were not enough votes in  his  caucus to support such a move.
 Reid  first faced pressure on this issue from junior Democrats four years ago  particularly Sen. Jeff Merkley  a former speaker of the Oregon state House  who became the point person for growing the anti-filibuster movement. But  Reid  repeatedly rejected their effort as too radical.
Even if Republicans want to do away with the filibuster someday   Reid  said  Thursdayâs move was worth it because the current climate had become too hostile to get anything significant done.  Reid  said  he  faced a choice: âContinue like we are or have democracy?â","The main combatants Thursday were the chamberâs two chiefs  Majority Leader  [TGT]  (D-Nev.) and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  who have clashed for several years over Republican filibusters of Obamaâs agenda and nominees.

3872,Prager: 'The Left is the Most Racist Movement Since the Nazis',Chuck Schumer,"âWould  Chuck Schumer  like to see fewer Jews in the judiciary so that the judiciary looked like the American population?â asked Dennis Prager on Fridayâs edition of his eponymous radio show.
Pragerâs comments came in response to  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerâs (D-NY ) opposition to a federal judicial nominee on the basis of the nominee being white.
 Schumer  further advocated for the implementation of racial and ethnic quotas within federal judicial nominations. Merit should be subverted in pursuit of âdiversity â  he  suggested  calling for the nomination of more female and ânon-whiteâ nominees on the basis of sex  race  and ethnicity. The federal judiciary should â[start] looking a lot more like the America it represents â said  Schumer  during a Wednesday Senate session:
The nomination of Marvin Quattlebaum speaks to the overall lack of diversity in President Trumpâs selection for the Federal judiciary. Mr. Quattlebaum replaces not one but two scuttled Obama nominees who were African American. As of February 14  83 percent of  President Trumpâs  confirmed nominees were male; 92 percent were White. That represents the lowest share of non-White candidates in three decades. It is long past time that the judiciary starts looking a lot more like the America it represents. Having a diversity of views and experience on the Federal bench is necessary for the equal administration of justice. After years of improvement  the Trump administration  as in so many other areas  is taking a giant step backwardâthis time  when it comes to the diversity of their nominations. I will be voting no on the Quattlebaum nomination.
Following  Schumerâs  quota-based logic  Prager asked if the share of Jews within the judiciary should be reduced in pursuit of proportionate ethnic representation:
I wonder  if [ Chuck Schumer ] thinks [the judiciary] should look like America â Iâm just curious  since Iâm a Jew  I can ask this question  because if a non-Jew asked this heâd be accused of anti-Semitism â so I would like to know  Iâll bet you that the proportion of judges who are Jewish is greater than the proportion of Jews in the society. Would  Chuck Schumer  like to see fewer Jews in the judiciary so that the judiciary looked like the American population? Is that an unfair question? Iâm serious  is it unfair? If heâs serious about what he said  does he think Asians overrepresent? Does he feel this way about sports?","âWould   [TGT] like to see fewer Jews in the judiciary so that the judiciary looked like the American population?â asked Dennis Prager on Fridayâs edition of his eponymous radio show.
Pragerâs comments came in response to  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerâs (D-NY ) opposition to a federal judicial nominee on the basis of the nominee being white.
  [TGT] further advocated for the implementation of racial and ethnic quotas within federal judicial nominations. Merit should be subverted in pursuit of âdiversity â   [TGT]   suggested  calling for the nomination of more female and ânon-whiteâ nominees on the basis of sex  race  and ethnicity.

3873,Niklas Hjalmarsson tries to move on after regrettable trade from Blackhawks,Niklas Hjalmarsson,"Two minutes into a conversation at Gila River Arena   Coyotes defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson  sounded as if  he  misses the Blackhawks as much as  his  former team clearly misses  him .
âI grew up there ââ  Hjalmarsson  said of  his  10 seasons with the Hawks. âAs a kid in the minors  my first organization. â¦ The city was special to me  and the guys I played with for such a long time  Iâll be connected with my whole life. There are a lot of fun reunions Iâm looking forward to.ââ
On the day of the NHL draft last June  Hawks general manager Stan Bowman overreacted to his vow for change by trading  Hjalmarsson  to the Coyotes for younger and more affordable defenseman Connor Murphy  who has been a disappointment.
One of only seven Hawks to have his name engraved on three Stanley Cups   Hjalmarsson  left town regarded as one of the top defensemen in team history â yet was considered expendable at 30. The fact that veteran Duncan Keith has been the only Hawks defenseman who hasnât been a healthy scratch this season says everything about the inconsistency at the position.
Those persistent problems underscore why trading  Hjalmarsson  upset Hawks coach Joel Quenneville enough for him to walk out of an NHL coaches meeting last summer after he was told.  Hjalmarsson  learned about the trade at home in Sweden  where  it  took awhile for the news to register.
âI didnât see it coming ââ  Hjalmarsson  said. âI felt like I had a decent regular season  but obviously our playoff run was embarrassing. Every year with the salary-cap situation in Chicago  a couple guys always move  so it was my turn â even if I wasnât prepared for it.ââ
Seven months later   Hjalmarsson  says  he  has yet to talk to Bowman about the deal but holds no bitterness.  He  even roots for the Hawks to make the playoffs.  He  didnât develop a reputation as one of the toughest guys in the league  pound for pound  because  his  ego bruises easily.
âIt doesnât bother me  and weâll talk sometime in the future ââ  Hjalmarsson  said. âI understand itâs a business. In this league  you have to separate that and try to see it Stanâs way and what  he âs trying to do for the team.  His  opinion was  he  was trying to make the team better  and I have to accept that.ââ
 Hjalmarsson  smiled.
âInstead of being pissed off about it  Iâm trying to look back and be extremely proud of what I did in Chicago and thankful for the fans there ââ  he  said.
In Arizona  fewer fans care about hockey and fall short of creating the atmosphere  Hjalmarsson  experienced at the United Center. The anthem before Tuesday nightâs matchup against the Sharks  which ended in a 3-2 shootout loss  came before a crowd of only 11 961 in a building that lacked buzz. No NHL team has fewer than the Coyotesâ 10 victories and  in this market  nobody seems terribly bothered about it.
The Coyotes hoped  Hjalmarsson  would help establish a winning culture  one of the reasons they made him an alternate captain. He welcomes the responsibility.
âWe had a lot of leaders in Chicago  but obviously I have a bigger role here with such a young team  so I want to show consistency on the ice with how Iâm playing and off the ice with how Iâm preparing and taking care of my body ââ  Hjalmarsson  said.
Injuries have slowed  Hjalmarssonâs  adjustment  causing  him  to miss 26 games already after missing just 32 over  his  last eight seasons with the Hawks. The first upper-body injury occurred Oct. 30 against the Flyers  and a second one happened Nov. 28 against the Oilers  knocking  him  out the entire month of December.
âItâs been a little frustrating obviously because you want to put your best foot forward and prove the organization right ââ  Hjalmarsson  said.
Some things never change: Despite limited action  the player known as âHammerâ still ranks among the leagueâs top 10 in blocked shots per game  average 2.5. Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet referenced that dependability when  Hjalmarsson  returned from his lengthy absence.","Two minutes into a conversation at  [TGT] sounded as if   [TGT]   misses the Blackhawks as much as   [TGT]   former team clearly misses   [TGT]  .

(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
 Betsy DeVos  displayed at best confusion and at worst a lack of knowledge about a key federal law involving students with disabilities during  her  Tuesday confirmation hearing before a Senate panel that will vote on whether  she  should become President-elect Donald Trumpâs education secretary.
Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) asked  DeVos  about the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)  which requires public schools to provide children with disabilities a âfree appropriate public educationâ and governs how states and public agencies provide various services to millions of students.
Kaine asked  her  if  she  believes that all schools that receive federal funding â whether public  public charter or private â should be required to meet the requirements of IDEA.
 She  responded: âI think they already are.â
 DeVos  said: âI think that is a matter that is best left to the states.â
 Devos  repeated: âI think thatâs an issue thatâs best left to the states.â
 DeVos  began speaking about a Florida voucher program for students with disabilities that requires students to sign away their IDEA due process rights.
 DeVos  said: âI think that is certainly worth discussion.â

Near the end of the hearing  Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) returned to the issue  telling  DeVos  that IDEA is a federal civil rights law and noting that federal law must be followed.  She  asked  DeVos  if  she  stood by  her  statement that it was up to the states to follow it  and  DeVos  responded  âFederal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play.â
 DeVos  responded  âI may have confused it.â
( DeVos  may have confused IDEA? With what  exactly?)
Hassan then explained to  DeVos  what IDEA actually guarantees to students with disabilities  and urged her to learn about it  saying she was âconcernedâ that  DeVos  was unfamiliar with it.  DeVos  responded that if  she  is confirmed as education secretary   she  would be âvery sensitiveâ to the needs of special needs students.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) asked   [TGT] about the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)  which requires public schools to provide children with disabilities a âfree appropriate public educationâ and governs how states and public agencies provide various services to millions of students.
Kaine asked  her  if  she  believes that all schools that receive federal funding â whether public  public charter or private â should be required to meet the requirements of IDEA.
 She  responded: âI think they already are.â
  [TGT] said: âI think that is a matter that is best left to the states.â
  [TGT] repeated: âI think thatâs an issue thatâs best left to the states.â
  [TGT] began speaking about a Florida voucher program for students with disabilities that requires students to sign away their IDEA due process rights.
  [TGT] said: âI think that is certainly worth discussion.â

3883,Breaking Down The Details Of Jimmy Garoppolo 's Record Deal,Jimmy Garoppolo,"The details of  Jimmy Garoppolo 's record-breaking contract have been revealed. We already know the franchise quarterback is set to earn an NFL-record $27.5 million per season on his new five-year deal with a whopping $74.1 million in guarantees and a $35 million signing bonus.
Those are some absolutely huge numbers for a quarterback that has started a grand total of seven games in four NFL seasons. More than anything  they tell us the 49ers are smitten with  Garoppolo . They also tell us that the quarterback market is going to blow up this offseason.
Washington Redskins Pro Bowler Kirk Cousins will cash in big time in free agency. Aaron Rodgers  Drew Brees and Matt Ryan are all in line for extensions that should now pay them north of $30 million annually. Yes   Garoppolo  has set a new market at the NFL's most-important position.
According to Spotrac  San Francisco entered Thursday with north of $118 million to work with under the cap. With  Garoppolo 's deal averaging $27.5 million  most figured that would take a nice chunk of said cap space.
However  the 49ers decided to structure the contract in a way that  Garoppolo  will be â by far and away â NFL's highest paid player next season in terms of cap hit. He's set to count a whopping $37 million against the cap in 2018. As of right now  that's $10.5 million more than any other player in the NFL. In fact  it's $15 million more than Tom Brady is slated to count against the Patriots' cap in 2018.","The details of   [TGT]  's record-breaking contract have been revealed.

3885,Comedy Legend Jerry Lewis Dies At 91,Jerry Lewis,"Jerry Lewis   the unapologetic and legendary comedian who started in the entertainment business in the 1950s  died at his home in Las Vegas on Sunday morning. He was 91.
The news was first reported by a Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist and was confirmed to BuzzFeed News by  Lewis 's agent.
"" Legendary entertainer Jerry Lewis  passed away peacefully today of natural causes at 91 at  his  home with family by  his  side "" read a statement from Lewis's family  given to columnist John Katsilometes.
Born Joseph Levitch in Newark  New Jersey  in 1926   Lewis  first rose to major notoriety alongside singer Dean Martin  becoming a household name and force in show business in the mid-1950s.
 Lewis  and Martin began as a stage duo in the 1940s. Their contrasting personas and comedic back-and-forth banter was a huge hit  and paved the way for a string of successful movies starring the unlikely pair. After a 10-year career together  the pair split  and  Lewis  received a $10 million  14-film deal with Paramount Pictures  the largest Hollywood deal in history at the time  according to The Hollywood Reporter.  Lewis  found success with the now-classic 1963 movie The Nutty Professor  which was later remade by Eddie Murphy in the 1990s.
In the following decades   Lewis  also became the host of the Labor Day telethon for the Muscular Dystrophy Association  a role  he  would hold for more than 55 years.  He  raised more than $2 billion and was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 for  his  work. Outside the US   Lewis  also enjoyed immense popularity in France  where  he  received the Legion of Honor award in 1983.
 Lewis  battled numerous health issues over the last few decades  starting in 1983  when  he  had open-heart surgery. In the early 1990s   he  had surgery for prostate cancer  and in 2006   he  suffered a heart attack.  He  subsequently battled lung disease for years  The Hollywood Reporter also noted.
In the last decade  Lewis  who was known for  his  cranky persona and oversize ego  garnered controversy for  his  political and social views â most notably in 2007  when  he  used a gay slur during the 18th hour of  his  Labor Day telethon.  He  later apologized for the incident  saying  he  ""obviously made a bad choice of words.""
 Lewis  also voiced  his  distaste for female comedians several times over the last few decades  and in 2015 told the Catholic broadcaster EWTN that ""refugees should stay where the hell they are.""
âHey  nobody has worked harder for the human condition than I have  but theyâre not part of the human condition ""  he  continued in the 2015 interview. ""If 11 guys in that group of 10 000 are ISIS  how can I take the chance? I donât want to lose another Frenchman or another Englishman."" In the same interview   he  also praised Donald Trump  then a candidate for president.

3888,Can Trump overturn Supreme Court abortion case Roe v. Wade? How?,Roe,"While Trump once supported abortion  he has since reversed his position  saying in his first interview after winning the election that he wants to appoint ""pro-life"" judges with the goal of overturning Roe v. Wade. His highly conservative nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat  Neil Gorsuch  is expected to try to carry out this mission.
Roe would likely fall in one of two ways  according to Dawn Johnsen  a constitutional scholar from Indiana University and the legal director of NARAL Pro-Choice America from 1988 to 1993.
The most drastic way the court could get rid of  Roe  would be to overturn the case. The more likely scenario  however  would see the court letting  Roe  stand but incrementally upholding laws that restrict access  making abortions impossible to get â rendering the procedure virtually illegal over time.
Glenn Cohen  a health-law expert and professor at Harvard Law School  said two kinds of laws provide the most likely paths for SCOTUS to overturn or undermine Roe.
The gradual erosion of Roe v. Wade is a much more likely scenario for diminishing abortion access  according to Cohen  because Chief Justice John Roberts often plays the ""long game."" Roberts hasn't explicitly come out against  Roe  or abortion (as is tradition with justices)  but he has said he respects the precedence of  Roe  yet supported abortion restrictions in Supreme Court cases while on the bench.
What would happen if  Roe  were overturned?
If  Roe  fell  13 states have laws on the books banning abortion  so the practice would be illegal there immediately. Other states would likely act quickly to pass similar ""trigger"" laws.
That would likely become even more apparent if Roe fell.
How likely is it that  Roe  will be overturned?
Toti said she doesn't think  Roe  is in ""any immediate jeopardy "" largely because both the Supreme Court and a majority of Americans support abortion.
Pew Research Center polls have found that 59% of US adults today support the legality of abortion in general and 69% want the Supreme Court to uphold Roe â both numbers that have risen over time.
Even if the Senate approves Gorsuch's nomination  Toti said  the court will likely still have a 5-4 majority that would uphold Roe.
It will likely be some time before Gorsuch can actively participate in cases  as well. Toti estimated that the lengthy Senate approval process will sideline the new justice from deciding on cases until at least October 2017. And even if Gorsuch is aggressively anti-Roe  Trump would still need another justice to retire or die to shift the balance  an unlikely scenario in the next four years.
Not everyone is as optimistic as Toti. If Trump is elected for a second term  the chances of him choosing another justice go up â as do the chances of  Roe  falling.
""I am very pessimistic about it  and that's because I'm thinking about the range of ways  Roe  can fall that would not require the Supreme Court to actually say  'We are overruling  Roe v. Wade  '"" Johnsen said. ""We've seen the kinds of laws that would shut clinics  and ban abortions for reasons  and force women to be interrogated by their doctors â and that all could be upheld without the Supreme Court actually saying  'We're overruling  Roe v. Wade .'""
Erica Sackin  director of political communications for Planned Parenthood  told Business Insider that the healthcare provider is ""absolutely gearing up for a huge fight "" and that the wave of donations they received underline how many people support upholding Roe â including those who voted for Trump.","While Trump once supported abortion  he has since reversed his position  saying in his first interview after winning the election that he wants to appoint ""pro-life"" judges with the goal of overturning Roe v.

As a member of the Cardinals during the 2014-15 seasons   Bourjos  vividly remembers how a young  inexperienced cast of players matured into a confident batch that overtook their National League Central rivals to make the playoffs.
Witnessing that transformation gave  Bourjos  more incentive to sign with the Cubs last month  albeit as a non-roster invitee.
âYou can feel this organization coming â said  Bourjos   who could fit nicely as a bench player because of his speed and outfield defense. âI remember in 2014 they didnât have the best year. But you could see they had the players  and things were starting to get turned around
âSure  Iâm home for spring training â said  Bourjos   who lives in Scottsdale in the offseason. âBut youâre with a team thatâs committed to winning. The other offers were from other teams that may have been rebuilding a bit.
Earning a roster spot would bring his family full circle. Bourjosâ grandfather  a Greek immigrant  owned a restaurant at the corner of Kedzie and Montrose in Chicago.

In  her  new book  Brazile reveals that concerns over  Hillary âs health were so severe  it was under serious consideration that  she  be replaced as the candidate  despite the campaignâs best efforts to shroud details of  Clinton âs ailments  which Brazile described as âshamefulâ.
Throughout the campaign  the mainstream media dismissed questions about  Hillary âs coughing fits  stumbles and collapses as baseless âconspiracy theories â a narrative that intensified after Infowars released a video on the subject that went viral  receiving millions of views in a period of just a couple of weeks.
But during  her  Fox News appearance  Brazile suggested that behind the scenes  journalists were desperately scrambling to find out what was actually happening.

That  she  was being considered maybe not able to finish? Do you think reporters knew that? How could they not know that?â

Backstage   Bryant  looked lovingly at the statue cradled in  his  hands and mouthed  ""My God.""

As executive producer of the six-minute film   Bryant  accepted  his  golden Oscar statue from ""Star Wars"" star Mark Hamill on Sunday night.  He  shared the award with Disney animator Glen Keane.
""You don't have to sit in a tub of ice "" Keane told  Bryant  backstage.
Among those offering their congratulations via Twitter were Hall of Famers Magic Johnson  Bill Russell and Shaquille O'Neal   Bryant 's former Lakers teammate who admitted  ""I'm jealous lol.""
Since hanging up his basketball shoes   Bryant  has delved into business (a new Nike shoe) and various forms of storytelling.

 Bryant  said  he  heard dismissive comments like ""That's cute"" when  he  told people  he  wanted to become a storyteller in retirement.
""The hardest thing when you start over  you have to quiet the ego and begin again. You have to learn the basics of things ""  he  said.
From the stage   Bryant  thanked  his  wife  Vanessa  and three daughters  naming each of them.  He  spoke a few words of Italian â a language  he  learned as a child growing up in Italy â and closed by telling them  ""You are my inspiration.""

3897,Zach LaVine makes Bulls debut scores 14 in 107,Zach LaVine,"The lights were low  the crowd was roaring and  his  Bulls teammates jumped around like school kids during introductions Saturday night at the United Center.
The scene had played out 20 times previously this season  but this one was special. This one featured  Zach LaVine  right in the middle of it.
Capping a journey that began 11 months ago when  he  suffered a torn ACL in  his  left knee while playing for the Timberwolves   LaVine  made  his  season debut during the Bullsâ 107-105 victory over the Pistons. Trading in street clothes for  his  home red Bulls uniform   LaVine  was the last of the five Bulls starters introduced to the delight of the 21 613 in attendance.
 LaVine  had been ready for this moment for weeks  but all sides erred of the side of caution before Saturday nightâs big moment.
âItâs tough  especially when youâre sitting on the bench knowing you can help  in a suit jacket â  LaVine  said. âIâm glad I donât have to be over there anymore. Iâll be able to â¦ leave my paw prints on the game a little bit.â
It didnât take long for  LaVine  to use  his  paws in a positive way  as  he  drained  his  first shot as a Bull â a 3-pointer â 37 seconds into the game.  LaVine   who is on a 20-minute limit for at least the next week  finished with 14 points and two assists in 19 minutes.  He  shot 5-for-9 from the floor  making 3 of 4 3-pointers before sitting for the final quarter.
While  LaVine  took the court with confidence for  his  first game in nearly a year  and the 22-year-old hit  his  first two shots.
âItâs like riding a bike â  LaVine  said. âYou might wobble a bit  but I can get back going straight and going faster each and every game.â
For a Bulls team that entered Saturday with a 12-7 record since Dec. 8   LaVineâs  debut sent a surge of excitement throughout the group.
âItâs the last hurdle to clear for  Zach  in this process â Hoiberg said. âFor him finally to get out there and get this behind him I know is very important.â
âWe put this system in place with  Zach  in mind â Hoiberg said. âIt happened to fit some of the other guys with our spacing fours  with playing some lineups where we had two spacing front-line players out here. But to have wings that can get out and run in transition is a very big part of what we put in place and also having guys who can come off hand-offs and rise up and shoot the ball.
As the centerpiece of the draft-day trade that sent Jimmy Butler to the Timberwolves   LaVine  realizes expectations are high for a player who was averaging a career-high 18.9 points per game in 47 games last season before suffering  his  injury.
âThatâs what comes with the game â  LaVine  said. âYou bring that upon yourself. Iâm going to continue doing the same things. Iâm a very confident person  Iâm a team player first and ... Iâm just happy to be out there playing again. I play with a love for the game. Iâm going to come through and do my part.â

As the centerpiece of the draft-day trade that sent Jimmy Butler to the Timberwolves   LaVine  realizes expectations are high for a player who was averaging a career-high 18.9 points per game in 47 games last season before suffering  his  injury.
âThatâs what comes with the game â  LaVine  said. âYou bring that upon yourself. Iâm going to continue doing the same things. Iâm a very confident person  Iâm a team player first and ... Iâm just happy to be out there playing again. I play with a love for the game. Iâm going to come through and do my part.â

 Brady  told the hosts of the morning show Kirk & Callahan that he was disappointed to hear the comments made by another host last week and is reconsidering whether he will appear on the station  WEEI 93.7 FM  in the future.
Last week  host Alex Reimer called Brady's daughter  Vivian  an ""annoying little pissant"" while discussing the quarterback's documentary series  Tom  vs. Time.

3903,Leaner Gary Sanchez ready to put defensive woes behind him,Gary Sanchez,"TAMPA â  A leaner looking Gary Sanchez  said  he  didnât lose any weight this offseason  but perhaps  his  new build will help  him  behind the plate  where  he  struggled at times a year ago.
âThis offseason  I worked really hard on defense because I want to be better than last year ââ  Sanchez  said through a translator Tuesday at George M. Steinbrenner Field. âI want to fix all the little issues I had last year defensively and keep improving.â
Those issues included allowing as many passed balls (16) as any catcher in baseball  as well as the second most wild pitches (53). Those numbers improved in the second half  but they led former manager Joe Girardi to bench and publicly criticize  Sanchez .
With Aaron Boone in charge   Sanchez  said  he  holds no grudge against Girardi.
âLooking back at all the things Girardi said  I feel all that stuff he said was to make me be better ââ  Sanchez  said. âAt the end of the year  I thought he helped me get better. Itâs tough to go through  but you have to learn from that and keep getting better. You also have to move on.â
 Sanchez  missed much of the early part of last season with a strained biceps  and when  he  returned   he  was a force again at the plate.
While  he  couldnât duplicate the historic numbers  he  put up when  he  hit 20 homers in 229 plate appearances in  his  breakout rookie season   Sanchez  hit 33 homers in  his  first full season in the majors.
âItâs a great acquisition ââ  Sanchez  said of Stantonâs arrival from Miami. âItâs a big powerful bat in a lineup thatâs gonna contribute a lot. â¦ It caught me by surprise when I heard the news [of the trade].â
âWeâll try to do what we did last year ââ  Sanchez  said. âThereâs definitely motivation whenever you get to be a part of a playoff run and be part of that atmosphere. You want to keep doing that every year. I feel great and am ready to go.â","TAMPA â  A leaner looking Gary Sanchez  said  he  didnât lose any weight this offseason  but perhaps  his  new build will help  him  behind the plate  where  he  struggled at times a year ago.

It was an experience  he  never will forget.
 Thompson  made a one-handed catch of Anthony Rizzo's fourth-inning home run from  his  seat in the first row of the right-field bleachers  leaning over the wall just enough to make the Nationals wonder if  he  interfered with the play.
""As it was coming out to me  I was just trying to figure out whether it was going over the fence or not and when I realized it was  I put out my hand and I caught it ''  Thompson   42  said.
Asked if  his  hand still stings   he  smiled.

Nationals fan Lewis Shea  sitting in the row behind  Thompson   concurred.

3909,Tom Brady proves once again he is immune to ravages of time,Tom Brady,"Maybe  Tom Brady  really can walk on water.
 Brady   completing 26-of-38 for 290 yards and two touchdowns  led the Patriots back from deficits of 14-3 in the first half and 20-10 in the fourth quarter and now the Patriots (15-3) are in position to win their second consecutive Super Bowl and third in the last four years.
Thanks to  Brady .
If you listened to the frantic reports all week about  Brady âs injured throwing hand  hurt on a botched handoff in Wednesdayâs practice and requiring stitches  and you listened to the Patriots typical clandestine dissemination of (no) information  you werenât sure if amputation was in order or if this was a gamesmanship ruse on the part of coach Bill Belichick.
Leave it to life-of-the-party Belichick to douse the  Brady  story with cold water  saying in his typical deadpan: âLook   Tom  did a great job and  he âs a tough guy. We all know that  all right? But  weâre not talking about open-heart surgery here.ââ
No  but  Brady  did rip the heart out of a game and an unafraid Jaguars team that had the Patriots right where they wanted â¦ until  Brady  put  his  cape on and became  Brady  again.
 His  first trick was a six-play  85-yard drive that took 1:07  climaxed by a 1-yard James White scoring run to cut the Jacksonville lead to 14-10 with 55 seconds remaining in the first half to change the momentum of a game Jacksonville had been controlling.
Then came  his  9-yard scoring pass to Danny Amendola to cut the Jaguars lead to 20-17 with 8:44 remaining in the game.
And finally   Brady  won the game with a 4-yard scoring pass to Amendola with 2:48 remaining in the game.
â He âs a legend for a reason ââ Jaguars defensive lineman Calais Campbell said.
By this time  any questions about  his  bloodied throwing hand had long before been answered.","Maybe   [TGT] really can walk on water.
  [TGT] completing 26-of-38 for 290 yards and two touchdowns  led the Patriots back from deficits of 14-3 in the first half and 20-10 in the fourth quarter and now the Patriots (15-3) are in position to win their second consecutive Super Bowl and third in the last four years.
Thanks to   [TGT] 
If you listened to the frantic reports all week about   [TGT]  âs injured throwing hand  hurt on a botched handoff in Wednesdayâs practice and requiring stitches  and you listened to the Patriots typical clandestine dissemination of (no) information  you werenât sure if amputation was in order or if this was a gamesmanship ruse on the part of coach Bill Belichick.
Leave it to life-of-the-party Belichick to douse the  Brady  story with cold water  saying in his typical deadpan: âLook   Tom  did a great job and  he âs a tough guy. We all know that  all right? But  weâre not talking about open-heart surgery here.ââ

Argento's list is roughly in order of occurrence  ranging from the 1970s (when  Weinstein  would've been in  his  20s) all the way through the 2010s. Some are stories you've probably already read about in the Times  The New Yorker  or elsewhere; others might be entirely new to you.
Altogether  they illustrate the enormity of  Weinstein 's crimes. This is a man who allegedly abused women consistently and systematically for decades  in an industry that kinda-sorta knew but  for various reasons  couldn't or didn't want to do anything about it.
But the list also serves as a reminder that  Weinstein 's victims are done being silenced.  Weinstein  spent  his  entire career bullying  intimidating  and threatening the women  he  abused into keeping quiet about what  he  did to them. But the floodgates are open now  and they're not closing again anytime soon.","In the five weeks since the New York Times first dropped their bombshell report on  Harvey Weinstein 's alleged sex crimes  the list of accusers has only grown longer.

3912,Trumpâs attempt at surprise visit to Korean demilitarized zone is foiled by weather,Trump Trump,"Trump 's attempt to make a surprise visit to the Korean demilitarized zone ahead of a speech to the South Korean National Assembly was foiled by bad weather â apparently the moderately thick haze that has covered the sky here this week. Secret Service agents made the call minutes after Marine One had taken off  forcing  Trump  to return to Seoul and abort the 30-mile flight north. After waiting another hour for the skies to clear  the White House canceled the visit to the heavily watched border region that has divided North and South since the halt of the Korean War in 1954.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that  Trump  was scheduled to tour the DMZ with South Korean President Moon Jae-in  which would have marked the first-ever joint visit.
""He's actually pretty frustrated "" she said of  Trump . Asked how long the trip had been in the works  she said it had been planned ""for a little while "" since before  Trump  left on  his  Asia trip last Friday. It was ""something the president wanted to do "" she said.
Last week  White House officials had ruled out a DMZ visit  saying it was becoming âa clicheâ and noting that Vice President Pence  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had each visited this year. After arriving in South Korea on Tuesday   Trump  toured Camp Humphreys  a joint U.S.-South Korean military base about 40 miles south of Seoul  where he ate lunch with troops and was briefed by commanders.
Aides said  Trump   in  his  speech to the Korean parliament  will lay out a broad strategy to increase international pressure on Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons and ballistic-missile programs.  Trump  asserted Tuesday that  his  administration is making âa lot of progressâ on North Korea  and  he  urged Kim to âmake a dealâ at the negotiating table.
âI believe it makes sense for North Korea to do the right thing  not only for North Korea but for humanity all over the world â  Trump  said during a news conference with Moon after a meeting at the Blue House.
âI do see certain movement  yes  but weâll see what happens â  he  added  without offering any details.
The DMZ visit was not announced publicly. The traveling press pool that accompanies  Trump  was summoned earlier than expected. Sanders met the group with a sign on which the letters âDMZâ were written and told them that is how she was instructed to inform them of the trip. She explained that the reporters were not permitted to make details public until after the president had visited the DMZ and returned to Seoul  presumably out of security concerns.
According to a pool reporter  the group boarded Chinook helicopters along with a half-dozen men in camouflage-patterned tactical gear. The helicopters traveled about 18 minutes before turning around.  Trump  does have a motorcade available in Seoul but taking the trip by ground would have taken longer and foiled the element of surprise; it also would have been difficult to shut down and secure crowded Seoul streets at a moment's notice.
South Koreaâs government had been opposed to Trumpâs plan to visit the DMZ  viewing it as unnecessarily confrontational at a time of heightened rhetoric between  Trump  and Kim  according to numerous reports ahead of the U.S. presidentâs visit to Seoul.
But  Trump  reportedly informed Moon during their summit talks Tuesday that  he  planned to go ahead with the visit  leaving the South Korean president with little choice but to agree. Moon was waiting for  Trump  at a guard post inside the DMZ  having arrived there earlier in the morning.
Kim Sung-han  a former vice foreign minister  said the fact that  Trump  didn't make it to the DMZ avoided unnecessarily raising tension.
""One of South Korea's goals of this summit was to lower the tensions caused by the war of harsh words between the U.S. and North Korea "" Kim said. ""Had  President Trump  made provocative remarks at the DMZ  it could have created a very serious situation.""
For that reason -- and contrary to the Blue House's official insistence otherwise -- the Moon government had been trying to steer  Trump  away from the DMZ  Kim said.
But Robert Kelly  a professor of international relations at Pusan National University in South Korea  said that the fears of escalation at the DMZ were overblown  suggesting the trip was all about imagery for  Trump .
â The president  is a show man   he âs a reality TV star â Kelly said. âI think the idea of standing in the DMZ and making pronouncements about being strong against North Korea appeals to  his  sense of theatricality.""","[TGT]  's attempt to make a surprise visit to the Korean demilitarized zone ahead of a speech to the South Korean National Assembly was foiled by bad weather â apparently the moderately thick haze that has covered the sky here this week.

3914,A former teachers union member leader is now fighting unions and pushing hard for school choice â TheBlaze,Rebecca Friedrichs,"Rebecca Friedrichs  is an unsung hero who should be sung about a whole lot more.  She  is an Orange County public school teacher with 28 years of being an educator under  her  belt.  She  also  just last year  found  herself  facing off against one of the most powerful teacherâs unions in the United States  the California Teachers Association (CTA).
More amazingly   she  used to be one of the union leaders.
 Friedrichs  tried to affect change from within the CTA â who were buying off politicians that restricted competition  and charging teachers absurd membership fees â that caused schools to stagnate. But  Friedrichs  soon came to realize that only the voters and the courts can break the hold that the union had over the state of California.
âSadly  parents and educators no longer run our public schools because labor unions control way too much on our campuses today â  Friedrichs  told TheBlaze. âI understand why labor unions focus on getting more for their members; thatâs their business model  and getting more money and power for themselves is their value. Great teachers and parents donât share the unionsâ values or business model. We believe children should be first in our schools  and we believe educational excellence and safety should reign supreme.â
And due to her battle   Friedrichs  became something of an icon for school choice. This in turned grabbed the attention of the popular conservative site  Prager U.
Naturally  they chose  Friedrichs  to star in their first video discussing why good teachers support school choice  and how competition has been proven to work for schools  just like it works well for the free market.
This is a message  Friedrichs  wants to get across very clearly. Having had years of experience with children  sheâs gotten a pretty good idea about how they learn and grow. As she told us  the way public schools treat kids nowadays you would think they view the children as defective  and in need of drugging to make them ânormal.â
âI believe our current public education system is designed for those who can sit still and listen all day â  Friedrichs  told TheBlaze. âMany boys â and some girls â do not fit this category  so we often drug them and call them âdeficit â and âdisorder.â Iâve had hundreds of these little boys in my classes throughout my career â and one of them grew in my womb â and none of them seemed âdeficit â or âdisorderâ to me.â
With  Friedrichs  and Prager U teaming up  both are confident that school choice across the nation is an achievable goal.
âPrager U has a huge national following with a large percentage under 35 years old. As a public school educator and parent of children who attended public schools  Iâm well acquainted with a lot of the indoctrination going on in our schools today â talk about fake news!â  Friedrichs  told  us . âKnowing the Prager U messages are reaching the younger generations gives me hope many will learn the Judeo-Christian values our great country was founded upon  so  we  can restore truth and goodness in  our  culture.â","[TGT] is an unsung hero who should be sung about a whole lot more.

3916,Bryan Harper hopes to join brother Bryce Harper on Nationals' big,Bryan Harper,"Bryan Harper  is in  his  first big league camp this spring. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
WEST PALM BEACH  Fla. â Just before 10 a.m. Sunday  a player rushed over to Field 2 on the Washington Nationalsâ side of the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches. He jogged alone  his spikes pounding the sidewalk. A boy stood nearby behind a fence  observing the start of the Nationalsâ final workout before position players report for spring training. He couldnât believe his eyes when he saw  Harper  spelled out on the back of the playerâs red jersey.
âI just saw  Harper !â the young boy called out.
Such is the baseball life of Bryan Harper  Bryceâs older brother and a reliever competing to establish his own name at the sportâs highest level. While Bryce became one of the majorsâ brightest stars in a near instant  Bryan  28  is in his first big-league camp this spring after five on the minor league side. Heâs seeking to resurrect his career following Tommy John surgery.
âJust being on the mound  just being back out there  is so much fun â  Harper  said. âIt had been so long.â
âWhen that happens  you just got to kind of sit back and just look at it and accept it â  Harper  said. âThereâs nothing you can do about it. Itâs your body. Your body just literally quit on you.â
 Bryan Harper  works with pitching coach Derek Lilliquist. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
 Harper  resumed throwing five months after the procedure last April. By August   he  was throwing bullpens and simulated games.  He  kept in constant communication with  his  brother throughout. The two would communicate between  Bryan âs morning workouts and Bryceâs games at night  Bryan keeping  him  updated on  his  progress and milestones before watching the Nationals play.
âI was watching every night and I actually learned a lot â  Bryan Harper  said. âIt wasnât even watching  him . It was watching Max [Scherzer] and [Stephen Strasburg] and watching those guys pitch  seeing what they do and picking up things.â

WEST PALM BEACH  Fla. â Just before 10 a.m. Sunday  a player rushed over to Field 2 on the Washington Nationalsâ side of the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches. He jogged alone  his spikes pounding the sidewalk. A boy stood nearby behind a fence  observing the start of the Nationalsâ final workout before position players report for spring training. He couldnât believe his eyes when he saw   [TGT] spelled out on the back of the playerâs red jersey.
âI just saw   [TGT]  !â the young boy called out.
Such is the baseball life of Bryan Harper  Bryceâs older brother and a reliever competing to establish his own name at the sportâs highest level. While Bryce became one of the majorsâ brightest stars in a near instant  Bryan  28  is in his first big-league camp this spring after five on the minor league side. Heâs seeking to resurrect his career following Tommy John surgery.
âJust being on the mound  just being back out there  is so much fun â   [TGT] said. âIt had been so long.â
âWhen that happens  you just got to kind of sit back and just look at it and accept it â   [TGT] said. âThereâs nothing you can do about it. Itâs your body. Your body just literally quit on you.â

3917,Evan Spiegel explains why Snapchat is making virtual art installations,Evan Spiegel,"Evan Spiegel  wants artists to have their own place on Snapchat.
That may sound like just an extension of Snapchat's existing AR efforts  like its 3D world lenses and dancing Bitmoji  but for  Spiegel   the effort represents the next step of  his  plan to bolster Snap as a company.
""The lenses that we are launching today is just an example of how Snapchat is trying to remove friction from the creative process ""  Spiegel  said. ""The fact that we can bring these ginormous sculptures anywhere in the world is just the beginning of how we can inspire young people to create.""
 Spiegel 's announcement had been somewhat ruined after the company quietly posted a countdown clock on its website Monday afternoon. Enterprising Twitter users discovered screenshots and videos related to the announcement by simply setting their computer clocks ahead.
The company says it plans to put the lenses in more locations in the near future.  Spiegel  didn't comment on whether more artists would eventually take part in the future too  but Snapchat's website for the installations has a form for artists interested in participating  so it seems likely that more artists will eventually take part as well.","[TGT] wants artists to have their own place on Snapchat.

3920,Harvey Weinstein accuser Lauren Sivan: 'I could not believe what I was witnessing',Lauren Sivan,"TV reporter Lauren Sivan  discussed the details of the incident Monday morning in an appearance on NBC's ""Megyn Kelly Today."" Kelly opened the show by declaring ""He's out"" as pictures of Weinstein scrolled on the talk show set's LED screens.
 Sivan  has joined a growing list of accusers who have come forward since last Thursday when the New York Times published an extensive report detailing decades of allegations that the veteran movie mogul sexually harassed women  from actresses to secretaries and script readers. Weinstein was fired Sunday night from the company he co-founded with his brother  Bob Weinstein  in 2005 as a result of the mushrooming scandal.
 Sivan  described the decade-old incident in which  she  met Weinstein at a party at a New York restaurant in which  he  was an investor. At the time  she  was an anchor for News 12 Long Island; at present  she  is an anchor for Fox O&O KTTV Los Angeles.
 Sivan  said Weinstein lured  her  to the restaurant's kitchen and tried to kiss  her . When  she  rebuffed that advance   he  allegedly blocked  her  passage in a narrow corridor while  he  masturbated  according to  Sivan .
""I just stood there dumbfounded ""  Sivan  said. ""I could not believe what I was witnessing.""  She  recalled thinking that  he  was ""disgusting and kind of pathetic."" The lengthy apology that Weinstein issued in a statement after the Times report hit was ""the last straw"" that made  Sivan  come forward with  her  story because  she  felt  he  showed ""no remorse.""
Kelly said at start of the interview that she has been friendly with  Sivan  for years  and she also noted that she has known Weinstein for some time. Last year  Kelly's disclosure that she endured sexual harassment from former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes helped speed the ouster of one of the most powerful figures in media.
 Sivan  told Kelly that after she rejected  his  kiss  Weinstein told her: ""Well then just stand there and be quiet."" Earlier in the evening at the party   Sivan  said  she 'd enjoyed a lively conversation with the famed producer about politics and presidential history  among other topics.  He  then invited  her  to take a tour of the restaurant's kitchen.
""The most demeaning part of it all was that 20 minutes earlier  he  was having this great conversation with  me  ""  she  said. ""I felt so great and flattered by it. And then to be told 'stand there and be quiet' negated any warm feelings.""
 Sivan  said  she  was shocked by ""the casualness"" of  his  actions. Amid  her  dismay   she  wondered if  she 'd managed to send  him  the wrong signal of  her  interest in  him .
""There's that feeling of shame  "" Sivan  said. ""Perhaps I did something to give  him  the wrong impression.""
 Sivan  said  she  decided not to go public with the story because  she  was in a long-term relationship with  her  boyfriend and didn't want to disrupt  her  life. ""I was lucky enough to never have to work with [Weinstein] again ""  she  said.
The day after the incident   Sivan  said Weinstein called  her  at the News 12 studio and asked if  he  could see  her  again.  She  recalled telling  him  ""absolutely not"" and  she  quickly hung up.","[TGT] discussed the details of the incident Monday morning in an appearance on NBC's ""Megyn Kelly Today.""

 BERLIN â German Chancellor Angela Merkel  cleared the last major hurdle on  her  path to a fourth term Sunday  after members of the center-left Social Democrats voted in favor of continuing their governing coalition with  her  conservative bloc.
âI congratulate the SPD on this clear result and look forward to continuing to work together for the good of our country â Merkelâs party quoted  her  saying on Twitter.
Had the long-time German leader faced a ânoâ result   she  would have been left with only two realistic options: forming a minority government or seeking a new election.
Parliament is expected to meet next week to elect  Merkel  as chancellor.
 Merkel  has worked since September  negotiating with rival parties to form a new government.
After Septemberâs national election  which saw the Social Democrats received just 20.5 percent of the vote and the anti-migrant Alternative for Germany party come in third place  then-Social Democratsâ leader Martin Schulz ruled out another grand coalition with  Merkel . This forced  Merkel  to negotiate with two smaller parties  one of which eventually rejected a deal.
Pressure from German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier prompted Schulz to rethink and weeks of haggling between his party and Merkelâs bloc resulted in a coalition agreement. Fewer Social Democrats approved the deal this time round than in 2013  when 76 percent backed a government with  Merkel .
Many Social Democrats  particularly on the left  had argued that the party failed to make its mark on the last government and wouldnât benefit from propping up  Merkel  for another term.","[TGT] . (Photo: Anthony Kwan  Getty Images)

TMX said  Harvey  decided to take the advice of the people around  him  and leave immediately  citing sources  and that  he  will enter a live-in facility that deals both with sex and other behavioral issues.

The magazine said that  Weinstein  was also a major fundraiser for numerous Democratic Party candidates  including the presidential campaigns of President Barack Obama and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

3924,Neil MacGregor on living with gods,Neil MacGregor,"A prime mover in this initiative is  Neil MacGregor   the institutionâs former director whose didactic skills as a lecturer and broadcaster have already redefined the role of great museums. It follows on from âA History of the World in 100 Objectsâ  his groundbreaking 20-week-long series of radio stories that went out in 2010. Now the BBC has started transmitting his reflections on religious culture in 30 new radio talks of 15 minutes each. The talks draw in part on âLiving with Godsâ  an exhibition at the British Museum that uses objects to portray the transcendent as it has been conceived throughout human history.
The oldest item  and the subject of  Mr MacGregor âs opening talk  is a mammoth-tusk sculpture called the Lion Man dating back to the Ice Age. Even among hunter-gatherers who were struggling to survive  it was worthwhile for someone to spend up to 400 hours fashioning an object that served nothing but a talismanic purpose  connecting people to invisible worlds. The newest object is a cross made by an Italian carpenter from bits of a ship that was carrying refugees when it foundered in the Mediterranean near Lampedusa (pictured).

Listeners are invited to follow his wanderings  to take jumps between cultures and historical eras and even to leap between the here-and-now and the transcendent. In the same few minutes   Mr MacGregor  describes a coat made from seal-gut by the Yupik people of Alaska and a figure of Osiris  an Egyptian deity that is connected with life  death and the underworld. The coat speaks of indigenous huntersâ sacramental relationship with their prey  the Osiris figure of the new life engendered by the Nile.
Jill Cook  who curated an important show at the British Museum in 2013 that explained how the Ice Age made the modern mind  is also the curator of this new exhibition. She shares  Mr MacGregor âs desire to present religion as a social phenomenon that has been present in every age of history  cementing and expressing social bonds  and also violently dividing people. By including exhibits related to the communist cult of atheism  she shows that attempts to squeeze religion out of society have sometimes dramatically misfired: anti-religion can easily become a cult.
 Mr MacGregor  is a social anthropologist on a vast plane  whereas Ms Cook leans more to the neuroscience of religion. By including sounds  such as softly heard bells and flutes  she draws attention to the aural stimuli that can arouse peopleâs spiritual antennae.","A prime mover in this initiative is   [TGT]    the institutionâs former director whose didactic skills as a lecturer and broadcaster have already redefined the role of great museums. It follows on from âA History of the World in 100 Objectsâ  his groundbreaking 20-week-long series of radio stories that went out in 2010. Now the BBC has started transmitting his reflections on religious culture in 30 new radio talks of 15 minutes each. The talks draw in part on âLiving with Godsâ  an exhibition at the British Museum that uses objects to portray the transcendent as it has been conceived throughout human history.
The oldest item  and the subject of  Mr MacGregor âs opening talk  is a mammoth-tusk sculpture called the Lion Man dating back to the Ice Age. Even among hunter-gatherers who were struggling to survive  it was worthwhile for someone to spend up to 400 hours fashioning an object that served nothing but a talismanic purpose  connecting people to invisible worlds. The newest object is a cross made by an Italian carpenter from bits of a ship that was carrying refugees when it foundered in the Mediterranean near Lampedusa (pictured).

3925,Hero Aaron Feis the Disarmed School Guard,Aaron Feis,"Most media reports have focused on  his  after-school job as a Stoneman Douglas High football coach ( here   here   here   here   and here ) â but  on Wednesday afternoon   Mr. Feis  was doing  his  day job as a school guard.  Mr. Feis  was legally disarmed by the federal government in  his  attempt to save potentially dozens of children from murder.
 Aaron Feis  was the right man in the right place at the right time  but  he  was legally prevented from using the right  constitutionally protected tool to do the job.  Mr. Feis  was shot on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School  shielding students from a killer with  his  own body. Ultimately   he  and 16 other people  mainly students  died.  Mr. Feis  was truly a remarkable and courageous man.
 Aaron Feis   husband  father  school guard  and football coach  rushed toward the fire and  by all accounts  engaged the shooter Nikolas Cruz soon after Cruz started shooting. The Sun-Sentinel reported that Feis ""was one of the first to respond."" When the ""Code Red"" went off  head football coach Willis May asked over the walkie-talkie whether the sounds were firecrackers.  Feis  retorted: ""Those aren't firecrackers. I'm going in.""
Per Sheriff Israel  Cruz then dropped his rifle and backpack and walked back down the stairs and exited the building. It is not 100% clear exactly when and where  Aaron Feis  made contact with Nikolas Cruz  and we will not know for sure until the sheriff's office releases more crime scene data  but we can make some reasonable inferences with the information available.
Broward County superintendent Robert Runcie is reported to have stated at a Feb. 15 press conference: ""We had an athletic director  a campus monitor who responded immediately when there was signs of trouble in the school."" Dave Hyde of the Sun-Sentinel wrote that ""Athletic Director Chris Hixon and  Aaron Feis  died in the same hallway."" Per the graphic in this Washington Post article  the four classrooms on the first floor in which Cruz shot people were all next to each other and close to the east stairwell. Only one person was shot on the second floor. This same article shows that Building 12 was adjacent to the school parking lot. It is logical to believe that  Feis  was in the parking lot ready to direct traffic as school was about to let out. As it has been reported that  Feis  died while shielding multiple students and only one victim was shot on the second floor  we can infer that  Feis  engaged the shooter on the first floor sometime soon after the shooting began.  Aaron Feis  likely was in the right place at the right time to save lives.
So why was  Aaron Feis  disarmed? Lisa Maxwell of the Broward County Principals and Assistants Association stated to the Sun-Sentinel:
What would have happened if Aaron Feis had had a a Glock on his hip when the Code Red went off? Two cases from the last several years serve as pertinent compare-contrast examples.
On May 3  2015  Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi attacked the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland  Texas where a free speech event was being held with about 150 people in attendance. Simpson and Soofi were armed with three pistols and three semi-automatic assault rifles. Despite being heavily outmatched in firepower  a single police officer working as a security guard at the event armed only with a .45-caliber Glock pistol shot and wounded the attackers and stopped the attack without any loss of life. Contrast this to the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine office in Paris on January 7  2015. Heavily armed men attacked Charlie Hebdo where they shot and killed 11 people and wounded many others. The first responder was a bicycle cop named Ahmed Merabet. As with  Aaron Feis  Merabet  had been disarmed by  his  government  as France has some the strictest gun control laws in the world  much stricter than those now being emotionally advocated in the United States.  Merabet  was shot and wounded and lay helpless to defend  himself  against  his  AK-47-wielding attackers  who then calmly walked over and shot  him  dead in the street.
If  Aaron Feis  had had a .45-caliber Glock in  his  hand and had been given the proper training  he  needed to do  his  job as school guard  I am convinced that  he  would have saved many lives after  he  bravely called out  ""I'm going in."" Rudyard Kipling once wrote: ""Every so often  a few evil men must die so that weaponless dreamers may live in peace.""
 Aaron Feis  was ready  but  he  had been unconstitutionally disarmed. How often must we watch innocent children die before we realize that the illusions of weaponless dreamers aid evil men?","Most media reports have focused on  his  after-school job as a Stoneman Douglas High football coach ( here   here   here   here   and here ) â but  on Wednesday afternoon   Mr. Feis  was doing  his  day job as a school guard.

3926,Trump says he wonât fire Mueller as campaign to discredit Russia probe heats up,Trump Trump,"President Trump on Sunday sought to douse speculation that  he  may fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III amid an intensifying campaign by  Trump  allies to attack the wide-ranging Russia investigation as improper and politically motivated.
Returning to the White House from Camp David   Trump  was asked Sunday whether  he  intended to fire Mueller. âNo  Iâm not â  he  told journalists  insisting that there was âno collusion whatsoeverâ between  his  campaign and Russia.
The presidentâs comments came a day after a lawyer representing Trumpâs transition team accused Mueller of wrongfully obtaining thousands of emails sent and received by  Trump  officials before the start of  his  administration â a legal and public relations maneuver seen as possibly laying the groundwork to oust the special counsel.
 Trump  criticized Mueller for gaining access to those emails  telling reporters the situation was ânot looking good.â
âItâs quite sad to see that â  Trump  said. âMy people were very upset about it.â
The outcry over Muellerâs investigation into Russiaâs 2016 election interference grew louder over the weekend among  Trump  loyalists and conservative media figures. Although  Trump  has publicly and privately criticized the Department of Justice and the FBI and voiced displeasure with  his  appointees there  the presidentâs advisers insisted  he  is not aiming  his  ire at Mueller.
As the special counsel has inched closer to  Trump  with a series of indictments and guilty pleas  including securing the cooperation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn  the presidentâs defenders have spotlighted examples of political bias among two senior FBI officials as proof of a compromised investigation.
FBI lawyer Lisa Page and counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok worked on the Russia investigation. Strzok was removed from Muellerâs team in July after text messages were discovered in which they discussed their dislike of  Trump  and support of Democrat Hillary Clinton; Page had left the team two weeks earlier for what officials said were unrelated reasons. Their text messages were released by the Justice Department last week and are still under review.
Some  Trump  surrogates have said the texts show that Muellerâs investigation is partisan.
âIt looks more and more and more like an attack on the presidency â former  Trump  campaign adviser Michael Caputo said Sunday. âI still donât believe Mueller is in for a silent coup  but I think people around him have shown that this thing is off the rails. . . . These texts and emails were a declaration of their membership in the resistance.â
The attacks have fed speculation about Muellerâs fate. Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) told a California television station on Friday that âthe rumorâ on Capitol Hill was that  Trump  would fire Mueller at the end of this week  as Congress disperses for a holiday break.
Liberal activist groups have readied mass protests in the event that Mueller is fired.  The sprawling âTrump  Is Not Above the Lawâ coalition says it has more than 400 demonstrations ready to launch nationwide. Were Mueller to be fired in the morning  events would be held at 5 p.m. local time; if he were fired in the afternoon or evening  protests would kick off at noon the following day.
Trumpâs aides said the rumors are nonsense. Asked whether the  Trump  transition team lawyerâs complaint was setting the stage for firing Mueller  Marc Short  the White House legislative affairs director  replied  âNo!â
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday on CNNâs âState of the Unionâ that  Trump  did not mention firing the special counsel when they had dinner Saturday night. âI donât have any reason to think that the president is going to do that  but thatâs obviously up to him â he said.
Advisers who have spoken recently with  Trump  about the Russia investigation said the president was sharply critical of Attorney General Jeff Sessions  as well as Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein  who oversees the Mueller operation â but did not broach the idea of firing Mueller.
Rather   Trump  appeared to be contemplating changes in the Justice Departmentâs leadership. In recent discussions  two advisers said   Trump  has called the attorney general âweak â and complained that Rosenstein has shown insufficient accountability on the special counselâs work. A senior official said  Trump  mocked Rosensteinâs recent testimony on Capitol Hill  saying  he  looked weak and unable to answer questions.  Trump  has ranted about Rosenstein as âa Democrat â one of these advisers said  and characterized  him  as a threat to  his  presidency.","President Trump on Sunday sought to douse speculation that  he  may fire special counsel Robert S.

3927,5 Times Mass Migration Fallout Proved Trump Ambassador Hoekstra Right,Wilders,"4. Geert Wilders Hate Speech Trials
The most prominent anti-Islamisation figure in the Netherlands today is firebrand politician Geert Wilders  leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV). Over the last few years   Wilders  has been taken to court for âhate speechâ over comments  he  has made about Moroccan migrants and against Muslims in general.
The first hate speech trial began in 2010 over  his  film Fitna which prosecutors argued incited hate against members of the Muslim community.  Wilders  was found not guilty in 2011 during a retrial as the judge viewed  his  comment appropriate in public debate.
In 2016   Wilders  was once again brought before courts for inciting hatred during a 2014 speech in which  he  asked a crowd if they wanted more or fewer Moroccan migrants. The crowd replied  âfewerâ to which  Wilders  then stated  âweâll take care of itâ.
Judges did not view  Wilders  favourably in the case and found him guilty of incitement  although shortly before the verdict   Wilders  made a statement saying: âWhatever the verdict  I will continue to speak the truth about the Moroccan problem  and no judge  politician  or terrorist will stop me.â
Despite the trials   Wilders  and the PVV came second place in last yearâs Dutch national elections.","4. Geert Wilders Hate Speech Trials

3928,Chicago cops stripped of powers as FBI probes ripoffs of drug dealers sources say,Ronald Watts,"Meanwhile  the city is still dealing with the fallout over a nearly decadelong run of corruption by former Sgt.  Ronald Watts  and  his  team of tactical officers  who were accused of forcing residents and drug dealers alike to pay a âprotectionâ tax and pinning bogus cases on those who refused to do so.
Despite mounting allegations   Watts  continued to operate for years despite a lengthy police Internal Affairs Division probe as well as investigations by the stateâs attorneyâs office and the FBI  according to court records.
When  Watts  was finally caught in 2012  it was on relatively minor federal charges  and he was given a break at sentencing by a federal judge who talked tough but in the end handed him only 22 months in prison.
In November  in what is believed to be Cook Countyâs first mass exoneration  15 men with drug cases tied to  Watts  had their convictions thrown out.

3929,Meet the Guy Who Burns Confederate Flags at NASCAR Races,Stilp Gene,"With a flourish   Stilp  sets his two-sided flag on fire and drops it in the trash can. âI consign this flag to the waste bin of history!â  Stilp  says as  he  is dramatically enveloped in white smoke.
Later  at a nearby diner   Stilp  smiles contentedly and reflects. ""Today went well ""  he  says before chomping into a veggie burger. This is hardly  his  first rodeo.  He  has been dubbed âthe P.T. Barnum of Pennsylvania politicsâ and is regularly referred to by friends and foes alike as a âmaster of political theater.â Stilpâwho lives in the Harrisburg areaâhas made a name for himself through a variety of creative  prop-laden  media-courting protest stunts. He's particularly well-known in the largely rural swath between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that folks call âPennsyltucky.""
But with his Confederate/Nazi flag-burning demonstrations   Stilp  says  âYou donât bring humor to this at all. When you have Heather Heyer dying at the hands of a neo-Nazi  people who are flying these flags to represent hate and white supremacy  everything is 1 000 percent serious.â
âAll across Pennsylvania you see the Confederate flag on peopleâs porches  so we confront them with the true meaning â  Stilp  says. âIt puts them on the defensive. You know  show me why your Confederate flag isnât equal to the Nazi flag? Explain to me why. They say  âWe canât help it if itâs been adopted by the KKK and white supremacist groups.â But itâs not my job to walk it back to where you want it to be. Thatâs the present reality  and it always was a symbol of hate.â
 Stilp  says  he  was motivated to make and burn  his  two-sided flags after seeing white supremacists carrying both flags during the Charlottesville âUnite the Rightâ rally.  He  was also incensed by Scott Perryâa US congressman from mid-state Pennsylvaniaâechoing Trump in blaming âboth sidesâ for the associated violence and Heyerâs death.
 Stilp âs no stranger to flags.  He  designed the lauded Flight 93 memorial flag to honor those who perished near Shanksville  Pennsylvania  on 9/11. ( Stilp  is also a volunteer firefighter and EMT who rushed to Ground Zero immediately after the terrorist attacks to help conduct search and recovery efforts.)
 His  Confederate/Nazi flags each cost about $20  two hours of  his  time  and no small amount of angst to create. âI feel disgusted  disgusted  making these flags  cutting out these stars  gluing a swastika â  Stilp  grimaces. âBut I gotta do it.â
After a few protest burns in Pennsylvania in August and September   Stilp  and Facka decided to take things to another level by taking their flags and fire to the belly of the beast: NASCAR racetracks in the South.
Advance word of their arrival in the local papers and websites drew scores of comments: Desires for  Stilp  to get a bullet in the head were among the more polite and reserved sentiments expressed.
âEhh  fear is overrated â  Stilp  says. Citing his anti-nuclear protests going back to the 1970sâincluding piloting a Greenpeace hot-air balloon over government sites in Nevada to stop imminent tests  and numerous instances of arrests and beatdowns by authorities while demonstrating at various facilities âStilp  insists heâs been through worse. Heâs actually skeptical any harm will come to him.
âIâve been telling him that weâre in a different political climate now than heâs used to â Facka says as  Stilp  sighs and bites into his burger. âWeâre much more susceptible to that lone-wolf  that one crazy guy. So I do have a lot of fear  to be honest.â
âMaybe â says  Stilp . âSo what? Iâm 67âwho cares?! I just donât want the police who are protecting us to get hurt  thatâs all.â
 Stilp  plans to burn  his  flags outside courthouses in nearly all of Pennsylvaniaâs 67 counties in the coming months  and maybe head down South again when NASCAR season starts back up next year.
âPeople do email us and say  âThanks for doing that  I donât have the guts to do that.â and things like that  or  âPlease watch yourself. Donât get shot ââ  Stilp  says. âWeâre just trying to educate. Hopefully we can change some behavior. Maybe get some of these people to take down their flags  whether itâs enlightenment or shame or peer pressure from their neighborsâ¦ whatever it takes.â","With a flourish   Stilp  sets his two-sided flag on fire and drops it in the trash can. âI consign this flag to the waste bin of history!â  Stilp  says as  he  is dramatically enveloped in white smoke.
Later  at a nearby diner   Stilp  smiles contentedly and reflects. ""Today went well ""  he  says before chomping into a veggie burger. This is hardly  his  first rodeo.  He  has been dubbed âthe P.T. Barnum of Pennsylvania politicsâ and is regularly referred to by friends and foes alike as a âmaster of political theater.â Stilpâwho lives in the Harrisburg areaâhas made a name for himself through a variety of creative  prop-laden  media-courting protest stunts. He's particularly well-known in the largely rural swath between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh that folks call âPennsyltucky.""
But with his Confederate/Nazi flag-burning demonstrations   Stilp  says  âYou donât bring humor to this at all. When you have Heather Heyer dying at the hands of a neo-Nazi  people who are flying these flags to represent hate and white supremacy  everything is 1 000 percent serious.â
âAll across Pennsylvania you see the Confederate flag on peopleâs porches  so we confront them with the true meaning â  Stilp  says. âIt puts them on the defensive. You know  show me why your Confederate flag isnât equal to the Nazi flag? Explain to me why. They say  âWe canât help it if itâs been adopted by the KKK and white supremacist groups.â But itâs not my job to walk it back to where you want it to be. Thatâs the present reality  and it always was a symbol of hate.â
 Stilp  says  he  was motivated to make and burn  his  two-sided flags after seeing white supremacists carrying both flags during the Charlottesville âUnite the Rightâ rally.  He  was also incensed by Scott Perryâa US congressman from mid-state Pennsylvaniaâechoing Trump in blaming âboth sidesâ for the associated violence and Heyerâs death.
 Stilp âs no stranger to flags.  He  designed the lauded Flight 93 memorial flag to honor those who perished near Shanksville  Pennsylvania  on 9/11. ( Stilp  is also a volunteer firefighter and EMT who rushed to Ground Zero immediately after the terrorist attacks to help conduct search and recovery efforts.)
 His  Confederate/Nazi flags each cost about $20  two hours of  his  time  and no small amount of angst to create. âI feel disgusted  disgusted  making these flags  cutting out these stars  gluing a swastika â  Stilp  grimaces. âBut I gotta do it.â
After a few protest burns in Pennsylvania in August and September   Stilp  and Facka decided to take things to another level by taking their flags and fire to the belly of the beast: NASCAR racetracks in the South.
Advance word of their arrival in the local papers and websites drew scores of comments: Desires for  Stilp  to get a bullet in the head were among the more polite and reserved sentiments expressed.
âEhh  fear is overrated â  Stilp  says. Citing his anti-nuclear protests going back to the 1970sâincluding piloting a Greenpeace hot-air balloon over government sites in Nevada to stop imminent tests  and numerous instances of arrests and beatdowns by authorities while demonstrating at various facilities âStilp  insists heâs been through worse. Heâs actually skeptical any harm will come to him.
âIâve been telling him that weâre in a different political climate now than heâs used to â Facka says as  Stilp  sighs and bites into his burger. âWeâre much more susceptible to that lone-wolf  that one crazy guy. So I do have a lot of fear  to be honest.â
âMaybe â says  Stilp . âSo what? Iâm 67âwho cares?! I just donât want the police who are protecting us to get hurt  thatâs all.â
 Stilp  plans to burn  his  flags outside courthouses in nearly all of Pennsylvaniaâs 67 counties in the coming months  and maybe head down South again when NASCAR season starts back up next year.
âPeople do email us and say  âThanks for doing that  I donât have the guts to do that.â and things like that  or  âPlease watch yourself. Donât get shot ââ  Stilp  says. âWeâre just trying to educate. Hopefully we can change some behavior.

3934,Truth Fiction and Lou Dobbs,Lou Dobbs,"Weâll get to the merits of the charges and countercharges shortly  but first itâs worth considering why  beyond entertainment value  all this matters. Over the last few years   Lou Dobbs  has transformed  himself  into arguably this countryâs foremost populist. Itâs an odd role  given that  he  spent the 1980s and â90s buttering up chief executives on CNN  but  he âs now playing it very successfully.  He  has become a voice for the real economic anxiety felt by many Americans.
The audience for  his  program has grown 72 percent since 2003  and CBS â yes  the same network that broadcasts â60 Minutesâ â just hired  him  as a commentator on âThe Early Show.â Many elites  as  Mr. Dobbs  likes to call them  despise  him   but others see  him  as a hero.  His  latest book  âWar on the Middle Class â was a best seller and received a sympathetic review in this newspaper.  Mario Cuomo  has said  Mr. Dobbs  is âaddicted to economic truth.â
 Mr. Dobbs  argues that the middle class has many enemies: corporate lobbyists  greedy executives  wimpy journalists  corrupt politicians. But none play a bigger role than illegal immigrants. As  he  sees it  they are stealing our jobs  depressing our wages and even endangering our lives.
âThe invasion of illegal aliens is threatening the health of many Americans â  Mr. Dobbs  said on  his  April 14  2005  program. From there   he  introduced  his  original report that mentioned leprosy  the flesh-destroying disease â technically known as Hansenâs disease â that has inspired fear for centuries.
âIncredible â  Mr. Dobbs  replied.
Mr. Dobbs and Ms. Romans engaged in a nearly identical conversation a few weeks ago  when  he  was defending  himself  the night after the â60 Minutesâ segment. âSuddenly  in the past three years  America has more than 7 000 cases of leprosy â she said  again attributing the number to Ms. Cosman.
I have been somewhat taken aback about how shameless he has been during the whole dispute  so I spent some time reading transcripts from old episodes of âLou Dobbs Tonight.â The way he handled leprosy  it turns out  is not all that unusual.
Second  Mr. Dobbs really does give airtime to white supremacy sympathizers. Ms. Cosman  who is now deceased  was a lawyer and Renaissance studies scholar  never a medical doctor or a leprosy expert. She gave speeches in which she said that Mexican immigrants had a habit of molesting children. Back in their home villages  she would explain  rape was not as serious a crime as cow stealing.

3935,Russia's Syria Peace Talks in Sochi Dissolve into Farce as Lavrov Gets Heckled,Vladimir Putin,"Russia âs president Vladimir Putin  wanted to be the world-renowned diplomat that brought peace to Syria. So last year  he  blew off the UN-sponsored peace talks led by Staffan de Mistura  and  he  joined with Iran and Turkey to form  his  own âpeace talksâ process held in Astana  Kazakhstan. And they came up with a peace plan.
Of course  the peace plan was rejected by the parties actually fighting in Syria: the Syrian regime led by the psychopathic president Bashar al-Assad  the âmoderateâ anti-Assad opposition in Syria  the al-Qaeda linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)  formerly Jabhat al-Nusra  al-Nusra Front  and the so-called Islamic State (IS or ISIS or ISIL or Daesh). All of those four groups rejected the peace plan  so it was ridiculous for  Putin  or anyone else to believe that the peace plan would work.
And it didnât. They came up with four âde-confliction zonesâ or âceasefire zones.â The fighting slowed down a little in these four zones for a little while  but today the whole agreement is in shambles  as the fighting is in full force. It is a total failure by  Vladimir Putin .
There was a meeting of  Putin âs peace plan group in Sochi on Tuesday that  Putin  was calling the âSyrian National Dialogue Congress.â
The meeting was supposed to take two days  but it was called off after one day  when Syrian opposition representatives heckled  Putin âs right-hand man  Russiaâs foreign minister Sergei Lavrov  and then walked out.
 Putin  announced in December that the Syrian war was over and that Russiaâs troops will be returned to Russia. Less than two months later  it is clear that  Putin âs announcement was garbage. Reuters and CNN and Tass (Moscow)
So Vladimir Putin took over the peace process business. The UN processes held out a fig leaf of being impartial  but Putin was clearly and unequivocally in favor of Bashar al-Assad and committed to supporting his genocide and war crimes while claiming to be promoting peace.

3937,Saakashvili leads Kiev protest against Poroshenko,Mikheil Saakashvili,"They call  him  âthe Energizer Bunny.â
To  his  supporters   Mikheil Saakashvili   the former Georgian president  is a tireless warrior against corruption and Vladimir Putinâs Russia who transformed his graft-ridden country into a showcase for Western reforms and is one of the most charismatic figures in the post-Soviet sphere.
To  his  enemies  of whom there are many   he  is a confrontational and divisive showboat who has a predilection at times toward authoritarianism and is consumed with a lust for power.
But both sides agree on one thing:  He  doesnât give up a political fight.
Today  Saakashvili  finds  himself  locked in yet another bitter battle â in Ukraine. And  his  main target is an old friend from  his  university days in Kiev in the late 1980s: the countryâs president  Petro Poroshenko.
 Saakashvili âs biography has seen numerous turns. A graduate of Columbia Law School  he spearheaded Georgiaâs 2003 âRose Revolutionâ and became a poster boy for the Bush administrationâs international pro-democracy agenda. (The U.S. Secret Service first gave him the âEnergizer Bunnyâ moniker.) He built a glass-walled police headquarters in Tbilisi to underscore his commitment to molding a modern and transparent force.
âThrow the goat out!â  Saakashvili  said in reference to Poroshenko  whom  he  accuses of corruption and blocking reforms to protect  his  allies. Later   he  called  the Ukrainian president  âa cheap Mafioso.â
The government is fighting back. This year  Ukrainian authorities said  Saakashvili  incorrectly filled out his citizenship application  and they stripped him of the Ukrainian passport he obtained in 2015  barring him from entering the country. (He was in the United States at the time of the announcement.) The move drew heavy international criticism and rendered  Saakashvili  a stateless former head of state  since Georgia had revoked his passport when he received Ukrainian citizenship.
In September   Saakashvili  responded by storming through a border crossing into Ukraine with hundreds of  his  supporters.  He  subsequently announced a âunited oppositionâ against Poroshenko and barnstormed the country to garner support and raise  his  profile.
Last week  Ukraineâs prosecutor general  Yuri Lutsenko  a Poroshenko ally  announced that authorities had rejected Saakashviliâs petition for political asylum  opening up his possible deportation to Georgia  where he is wanted on charges of embezzlement and abuse of power while in office.  Saakashvili  says the case against  him  in Georgia is a political witch hunt.
Lutsenko also accused  Saakashvili  of trying to organize âa violent coupâ and obtaining visas for 20 of his Georgian supporters under false pretenses.  Saakashvili   for  his  part  denied the accusations and said authorities had illegally seized and deported a number of  his  followers.
âThe general prosecutor is lying completely!â  Saakashvili  wrote in a Facebook post  claiming that Ukrainian law allowed him to stay in the country.
For  Saakashvili   deportation would be an ignominious end to what was supposed to be  his  political resurrection. When  he  arrived in Ukraine over two years ago as an exile  Poroshenko installed  him  as Odessa governor in hopes that the Georgian could work  his  reformist magic on one of Ukraineâs most corrupt regions.
â Mikhail Saakashvili  is my friend from our student years. I remember  him  as a strong and decisive person  and I have reason to trust  him  â Poroshenko tweeted at the time.
The trust  however  soon turned into open antipathy.  Saakashvili  said the Kiev government was impeding  his  reforms and resigned as governor one year later  lashing out at PoroÂ­shenko and other top officials.  He  launched  his  own political movement and started a talk show. On one episode  a female war veteran sang a song called âThe Chocolate Ass.â Few missed the reference: Poroshenko is a billionaire candy tycoon.
But there are political figures  including within the opposition itself  who are uncomfortable with  Saakashvili âs emergence as a Ukrainian rabble-rouser â the demonstration in front of the parliament being a case in point  they say.","They call  him  âthe Energizer Bunny.â
To  his  supporters    [TGT]    the former Georgian president  is a tireless warrior against corruption and Vladimir Putinâs Russia who transformed  [TGT]  graft-ridden country into a showcase for Western reforms and is one of the most charismatic figures in the post-Soviet sphere.
To  his  enemies  of whom there are many   he  is a confrontational and divisive showboat who has a predilection at times toward authoritarianism and is consumed with a lust for power.
But both sides agree on one thing:  He  doesnât give up a political fight.
Today  Saakashvili  finds  himself  locked in yet another bitter battle â in Ukraine. And  his  main target is an old friend from  his  university days in Kiev in the late 1980s: the countryâs president  Petro Poroshenko.
  [TGT]  âs biography has seen numerous turns. A graduate of Columbia Law School  he spearheaded Georgiaâs 2003 âRose Revolutionâ and became a poster boy for the Bush administrationâs international pro-democracy agenda. (The U.S. Secret Service first gave him the âEnergizer Bunnyâ moniker.) He built a glass-walled police headquarters in Tbilisi to underscore his commitment to molding a modern and transparent force.
âThrow the goat out!â   [TGT] said in reference to Poroshenko  whom   [TGT]   accuses of corruption and blocking reforms to protect   [TGT]   allies. Later    [TGT]   called  the Ukrainian president  âa cheap Mafioso.â
The government is fighting back. This year  Ukrainian authorities said   [TGT] incorrectly filled out  [TGT]  citizenship application  and they stripped  [TGT]  of the Ukrainian passport  [TGT]  obtained in 2015  barring  [TGT]  from entering the country. ( [TGT]  was in the United States at the time of the announcement.) The move drew heavy international criticism and rendered  Saakashvili  a stateless former head of state  since Georgia had revoked  [TGT]  passport when  [TGT]  received Ukrainian citizenship.
In September    [TGT] responded by storming through a border crossing into Ukraine with hundreds of  his  supporters.  He  subsequently announced a âunited oppositionâ against Poroshenko and barnstormed the country to garner support and raise  his  profile.
Last week  Ukraineâs prosecutor general  Yuri Lutsenko  a Poroshenko ally  announced that authorities had rejected Saakashviliâs petition for political asylum  opening up his possible deportation to Georgia  where he is wanted on charges of embezzlement and abuse of power while in office.
