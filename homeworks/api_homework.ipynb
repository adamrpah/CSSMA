The most basic and incorrect assumption we will make is that the population within an age bracket is uniformly distributed. This means that if there are 10,000 50-59yo males, then we assume that there are 1,000 50yo males, 1,000 51yo males, 1,000 52yo males, and so on. \n",

    "* There is no death, so 90 becomes 100 after 10 years\n",
