    "## First of all, Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "The research world you are entering is a markedly different one than 20 years ago. What was once supplemental, the computer, has become ubiquitous throughout research. Further, the need for programming as a skill, either to increase productivity, enhance reproducibility, or unlock innovative research programmes, has moved from nearly non-existent to almost expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a part of this course, we will attempt to define computational social science, where it came from and what it means now, as well as highlighting and growing three main skill areas to aid you in independent research. These broad areas are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * The Web\n",
    " * Networks\n",
    " * Text analysis\n",
    " \n",
    "Through primary research literature and hands-on work we will develop both an understanding and skill at executing research techniques in these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class style\n",
    "\n",
    "During class time we will use active learning, coding together and solving exercises with short periods of lecture and discussion. I structure the class because the act of 'programming' is incidental to the goal of learning how to conduct research in these areas. In class, I will go over the 'big idea' and discuss implementation (making sure we all start and end at the same place of understanding. \n"
