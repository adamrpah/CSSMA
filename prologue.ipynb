Further, the need for programming as a skill, either to increase productivity, enhance reproducibility, or unlock innovative research programmes, has moved from nearly non-existent to almost expected. \n",

In class, I will go over the 'big idea' and discuss implementation (making sure we all start and end at the same place of understanding. \n"
