    "## First of all, Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "The research world you are entering is a markedly different one than 20 years ago. What was once supplemental, the computer, has become ubiquitous throughout research. Further, the need for programming as a skill, either to increase productivity, enhance reproducibility, or unlock innovative research programmes, has moved from nearly non-existent to almost expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a part of this course, we will attempt to define computational social science, where it came from and what it means now, as well as highlighting and growing three main skill areas to aid you in independent research. These broad areas are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * The web\n",
    " * Networks\n",
    " * Text analysis\n",
    " \n",
    "Through primary research literature and hands-on work we will develop both an understanding and skill at executing research techniques in these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class style\n",
    "\n",
    "During class time we will use active learning, coding together and solving exercises with short periods of lecture and discussion. I structure the class because the act of 'programming' is incidental to the goal of learning how to conduct research in these areas. In class, I will go over the 'big idea' and discuss implementation (making sure we all start and end at the same place of understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Before class preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the syllabus, this is **not** the class where you are taught how to program. You **must** already know the basics of how to program in Python. I do not expect you to be an expert, but I do expect that you can figure out how to solve basic issues and errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "My main focus in this class is maintaining momentum and equipping you with the skills necessary to confidently conduct independent research using these techniques. To accomplish this goal, there will not be time to help with remedial lessons on how to program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because programming is very similar to speaking a foreign language, I have built in some 'flex' time into the first two weeks for everyone to 'dust some cobwebs' from their brain. However, this time will not exist after that period and students are expected to be able to keep pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel like you need a directed guide to get back in the swing of things, I of course recommend the materials I use to teach my Introductory class on programming and data analysis (which are available at http://bit.ly/nico101). Similarly, if you are curious about what I consider to be the 'basics' of programming you can refer to the topics covered in that course. "

This project will commence week 4 and will be due at the end of the quarter. The deliverable will be a paper, written in academic style, that describes your research question and results. A write up of how you arrived at these conclusions (i.e. how you coded it) will comprise the methods section.\n"
