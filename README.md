# Before class prep

Before class you need to have anaconda installed and download the course documents.

You should download the v1.03 tag of the course from this git repository.

# Installation

Before class starts we'll need to make sure that we're all on the same page. To do that we'll need
to install a few extra modules. On the command line of this folder execute:


To install create a new conda environment:

`conda create --name cssma`

Activate the environment:

`conda activate cssma`

Install the conda packages:

`conda install -c conda-forge --file requirements_conda.txt`
