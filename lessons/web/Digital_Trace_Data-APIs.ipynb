That action is called a `request`. \n",

    "* 303, **See Other**. The response to the request can be found under another URI using a GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), the client should presume that the server has received the data and should issue a redirect with a separate GET message. Your web browser automatically fetches the new URL but web crawlers do not usually do this unless you specify it.\n",
    "* 400, **Bad Request**. The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).\n",
    "* 401, **Unauthorized**. Similar to `403 Forbidden`, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.\n",
    "* 403, **Forbidden**. The request was a valid request, but the server is refusing to respond to it. `403` error semantically means \"unauthorized\", i.e. the user does not have the necessary permissions for the resource.\n",
    "* 404, **Not Found**. The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.\n",
    "* 500, **Internal Server Error**. A generic error message, given when an `unexpected` condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.\n",
    "* 503, **Service Unavailable**. The server is currently unavailable (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance). Generally, this is a temporary state.\n",
    "* 504, **Gateway Timeout**. The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.[\n",
