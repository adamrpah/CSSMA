The mathematical purpose of community detection is relatively simple, given a graph $G=(V,E)$ find some partition $p_i$ that maximizes in-group connectedness and minimizes out-group connectedness (partition is a synonym for community in the following). \n",

Which means that even if you wrote a computer program to evaluate every single partition for a sufficiently large network, the universe would likely cool and collapse first (to say nothing about your own mortality).\n",

Given that all community detection algorithms are effectively heuristics, this means that there can be large number of possible solutions.
