    "#### Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "In the field of topic modelling, a collection of documents is refered to as a corpus. \n",
    "We can also build our own corpus of interest. \n",
    "For example, if we want to have a brief overview of what kind of new knowledge we have learned from the papers we read during the last year, we can put all the research articles together, name it as a corpus, throw it into the topic model, and find out what we can get.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Thare are several commonly used corpora that usually serve as benchmarks in the literature, such as\n",

    "[20 News Group](https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/20newsgroups/20newsgroups.html), and so on. \n",
    "* These corpora have both the text documents and their coresponding labels (or categories).\n",
