    "# Disambiguation\n",
    "\n",
    "Disambiguation is fundamentally different from the NER task that we have been dealing with and follows as a next step once you have extracted entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Disambiguation is **extremely difficult** in almost any real big data setting. There is just no way around the fact that text data that you obtain will contain ambiguity that is impossible to resolve with 100% certainty unless you were able to speak to the data creator or were a part of the data creation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple example, one of the most active areas of disambiguation research is in Author Name Disambiguation (AND) for scientific publications. If you have two manuscripts that both have the author `Yang, Y.`, how you can be certain that `Yang, Y.` of `Manuscript_1` is the same `Yang, Y.` of `Manuscript 2`? More than one person can have the same name, there can be both a `Paris, TX` and `Paris, FR`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is 'duplication' in language, this is why at national levels people have some form of a number (social security number in the US) that is unique to each individual -- even if they have the same name. For locations, each city in the US has a FIPS code (like we used with the census) that is unique, even if a town or city shares a name with a town in another state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Disambiguation is the process of creating these unique entity indices for our own entities -- we are essentially taking all of the entities that we find and trying to reduce the pool down to the unique entities and assign a \"SSN\" to each unique pool of entities. Thus, we know that `IAGO` in line 10 is the same entity as `IAGO` in line 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise Discussion. \n",
    "\n",
    "What features would you think to use in something like author name disambiguation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Back to our usage\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't have much of a real example to work through here because what we would care about is direct matching. In the real world we would typically have to deal with misspellings or variations in spellings, which is what grows the pipeline. One of the most fundamental techniques in doing disambiguation is leveraging fuzzy matching to generate potential candidates. Names with a high-similarity are considered as potential match candidates for further consideration and low-similarity candidates are discarded. "
