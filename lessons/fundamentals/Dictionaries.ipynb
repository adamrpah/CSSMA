    "## Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python dictionary is an extraordinarily useful data type that expands on the possibilities offered by lists.  In a list one keeps track of the elements by an index that must be an integer.  **Dictionaries keep track of elements by `key`!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each element in a dictionary is an **item**, and every `item` has both a **key** and a **value**. You use the `key` to \"look up\" the `value`. This concept is just like if we wanted to look up the meaning of a word in a real dictionary. Also, just like in a real dictionary, it means that all of the `keys` **must** be unique. If we had a `key` multiple times, then we wouldn't know where to go look up its `value`. Remember `sets`?  **The `keys` in a dictionary form a set!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax to create a dictionary also uses the syntax`{}`. If we are initializing a dictionary, we enter `key-value` pairs separated by commas; for each `item`, the key is separated from the value by a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "`a_dict = {key : value, another_key : another_value}`\n"

    "`JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. `JSON` is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. **These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language**.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is built on two structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.\n",
    "* An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\n",

    "In JSON, they take on these forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An `object` is an unordered set of `name/value` pairs. An object begins with { (left brace) and ends with } (right brace). Each name is followed by : (colon) and the name/value pairs are separated by , (comma).\n",
    "* An `array` is an ordered collection of `values`. An array begins with [ (left bracket) and ends with ] (right bracket). `Values` are separated by , (comma).\n",
